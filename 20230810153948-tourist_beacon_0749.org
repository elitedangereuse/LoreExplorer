Brookes Memorial Series - Beacon 5/5
"Where Michael rests now is a matter of rumour.

To say his spirit quietly rests is at odds with the person many
knew. There was also a new experience to pursue. The next frontier to
discover. Many discussions of Michaelâ€™s [[id:1725a42a-f02e-4287-8d6a-545ec0d1854a][legacy]] turn, inevitably,
towards one such undiscovered entity: [[id:a2bd8247-2daf-4bd9-b6da-667ff707b0a2][Raxxla]].

A mythological something that stirs wonder among every spacer, this
undefined myth remains elusive. But experienced pilots will tell you:
If anybody knows the way to Raxxla, [[id:e9a37bf8-a24d-4fb9-9dc2-77a87576aad7][Michael Brookes]] does."

And fast by, hanging in a [[id:27964f14-3085-4c0b-b763-76c17350c55b][golden chain]],
This [[id:dc011cdb-9d33-40ff-b1b4-428606d63f0c][pendent]] world, in [[id:d8eaae10-864d-4e6d-888b-4bacca5e3828][bigness]] as a [[id:91031d1d-989a-4367-a33a-7e915ed55bda][star]]
Of smallest [[id:690aa306-3779-472b-a20c-0cf77fa79297][magnitude]], close by the [[id:e998c95c-a76f-4312-a8c2-3a8706232ae9][moon]].
