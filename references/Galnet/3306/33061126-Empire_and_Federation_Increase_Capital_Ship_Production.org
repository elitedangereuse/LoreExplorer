* Empire and Federation Increase Capital Ship Production

/26 Nov 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Federal and Imperial Navies have both requested commodities for the construction of new capital ships. 

President Zachary Hudson has convinced Congress to increase funding for the Federal Navy, and to advance the construction programme for Farragut-class Battle Cruisers. In a powerful address, he said: 

“Defending the Federation is our highest priority in these uncertain times. It is vital that we reinforce our capability to protect the people from all threats.” 

The Federal Navy urgently requires additional resources to meet the new shipbuilding timetable. Deliveries of building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies are requested at Schweickart City in the Parutis system. 

A similar declaration was made in the Imperial Senate mere hours later, when Senator Denton Patreus announced: 

“We face adversaries on all sides and from within, eager to corrupt and destroy our proud Empire. This is a time to bolster our strength and our resolve.” 

The Imperial Navy confirmed that new Majestic-class Interdictors and other military vessels are being assembled. A request has been made for shipments of building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies to Miyasaka Orbital in the Mandh system.
