* Supplies for Marlinist Refugees Successfully Delivered

/29 Oct 3306/

A Federal charity initiative to deliver vital supplies for Marlinist refugees from the Empire has concluded. 

Safeguard Interstellar, a humanitarian aid organisation, received an impressive response to its request to provide basic necessities to Marlinist immigrants claiming asylum in the Federation. 

CEO Noel Beaumont announced: 

“These much-needed shipments of basic medicines, clothing, food cartridges, fruit and vegetables, and evacuation shelters will be used to sustain the Marlinist populations in the LTT 3607, Charunder and Ennead systems, at least until they can receive the state support granted by Congress.” 

“Our affiliate, the Fionn Liberals, will be pleased to reward contributing pilots at Fox Enterprise in the LFT 625 system.” 

The charity shared a message from Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader: 

“To all the pilots who brought these life-saving supplies – thank you. Leaving our homes has been incredibly difficult, but you and Safeguard Interstellar have provided ports in the storm. Many of us hope to start afresh in the Federation, where we know our democratic ideals will be nourished.”
