Carns Economic Success 
 
Newly promoted Chief Communications Officer Ramon Lamor held an enthusiastic press conference announcing the success of Humason Orbital’s project to upgrade its economy to High Tech. 

“This is great news for our future. This economic development will lead to a new era of prosperity for Humason Orbital and the Carns system as a whole.” 

When asked about the civic disruption reported in previous weeks, he replied: 

“There have been a few and thankfully isolated disruptive elements seeking to keep our fine society in an ever-declining economic state. These individuals have been encouraged to see the error of their ways and are now completely onboard with our grand economic plan.”
