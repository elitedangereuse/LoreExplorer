* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/23 Nov 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 7,692 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Dukes of Arikaras 

LP 716-35 Confederacy 

United G 85-12 Labour 

Nandh Purple Allied Interstellar 

Apishna Guardians of Tradition 

Dragons of 32 Mu Serpentis 

Bindi Vision Network 

HIP 32382 Confederation 

Jangore Monarchy 

Annwn Group 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
