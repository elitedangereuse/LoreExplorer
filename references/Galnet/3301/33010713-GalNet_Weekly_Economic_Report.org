GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

The following 10 of the 4446 minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Noblemen of V774 Herculis 

HDS 123 Services 

Ross 754 Labour 

People's Tun for Equality 

LTT 15278 Gang 

Cartel of Hajo 

Awawar Liberty Party 

Peche Purple Life Network 

Orgelal Major Services 

Namon Dominion 

When in boom  the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

These 2 minor factions are suffering an economic bust: 

Eotienses Silver Universal PLC 

Jet Energy Industry 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
