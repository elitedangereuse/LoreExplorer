GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

The following 10 of the 4479  minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Fong Wang Limited 

Ling Deti Blue Dynamic Comms 

Values Party of Alano 

Canopus Crimson Dragons 

Daksakhi Liberals 

Gyvatiges Jet Power Industries 

Liabeze Legal Organisation 

LP 376-62 Collective 

New Groombridge 1618 Focus 

Zugen Incorporated 

When in boom  the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

These 7  minor factions are suffering an economic bust: 

HIP 117870 Confederation 

Leaders of Kini 

Labour of Gali 

Devane Patrons of Law 

Pachita Crimson Fortune Int 

Progressive Party of GD 140 

Caeritis Front 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
