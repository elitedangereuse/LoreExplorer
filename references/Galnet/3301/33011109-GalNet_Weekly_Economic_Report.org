* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/09 Nov 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 7,325 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Liberty Party of LP 861-12 

GD 279 Silver Cartel 

Beta Comae Berenices Freedom Party 

Liberals of Tai Shere 

Wolfberg Purple Partnership 

Purungurawn Purple Dynamic Comms 

Chao Wu Empire Group 

Unktock Free 

Independents of LTT 4461 

Oresqu Silver General Corp 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
