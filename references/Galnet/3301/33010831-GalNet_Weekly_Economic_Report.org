GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,539 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Independent LP 30-55 Confederacy 

Avalon Organisation 

Liberty Party of Tz'utuls 

Glusargiz Patron's Principles 

Angurongo Patron's Principles 

Mawu Corporation 

Reddis Independents 

LHS 3262 Blue Clan 

Kruger 60 Free 

Kuki An Ring 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

These minor factions are experiencing an economic bust: 

Zandu Jet Syndicate 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
