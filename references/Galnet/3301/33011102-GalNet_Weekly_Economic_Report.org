* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/02 Nov 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 8,296 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Alliance of Wolf 485a 

Traditional CD-64 139 Flag 

Revolutionary Party of Patosata	 

Ross 199 Silver Raiders 

19 Leonis Min Alliance Combine 

HIP 11433 Blue Cartel 

Kebel Yeh Independents 

LTT 198 Order 

Olwain Liberals 

Progressive Party of Nanabozho 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
