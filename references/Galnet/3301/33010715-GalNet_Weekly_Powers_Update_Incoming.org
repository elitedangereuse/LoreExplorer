GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming 
 
In the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT ) the GalNet monitoring of powersâ€™ activities will go offline for a short period to assemble the latest data. 

Any pilots who operate for any of the powers should ensure that they deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time for their activities to be registered.
