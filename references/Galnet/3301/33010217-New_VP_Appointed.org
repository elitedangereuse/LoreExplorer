* New VP Appointed

/17 Feb 3301/

In a formal ceremony in the Congress building on Mars, Congressman Ethan Naylor, the Congressman for Siren  was formally signed in as the Federal Vice President. 

This is a controversial choice as this is the first time a member of the Federal Leadership has been a Congressman from a frontier world. Some have said that President Halsey is reacting to critics that here government is too Sol-centric, and others that she may regret the choice. 

In his appointment speech Naylor said: 

“I am honoured to have this phenomenal role. I will see it as my job to see that Federal States on the frontier will get the attention they deserve.”
