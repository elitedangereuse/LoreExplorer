GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,607 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

HIP 20277 Inc 

People's Procyon Values Party 

Confederacy of Audhumbwe 

Ngandins Organisation 

Workers of Macuayan Liberals 

United LTT 16548 Movement 

Xereta Gold Creative Corp. 

G 203-47 Silver Fortune Ind 

Future of CD-39 14212 

Chick Bara Empire Group 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 46 minor factions experiencing an economic bust: 

Zandu Jet Syndicate 

Democrats of LTT 4961 

Chi Orionis Vision Organisation 

Ovid Defence Force 

Ross 490 Justice Party 

Law Party of CD-51 102 

Isleta Transport Incorporated 

HIP 51197 Central Services 

CD-35 9019 Liberals 

Lalande 38451 Creative PLC 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
