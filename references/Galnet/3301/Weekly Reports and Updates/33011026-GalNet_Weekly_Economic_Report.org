* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/26 Oct 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 10,017 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

People's Meldrith Values Party 

Kuukese Autocracy 

Sicuncheim Dragons 

LHS 1393 Jet Clan 

Nzambassee Pro-Alliance League 

Progressive Party of Waka Mu 

HR 5504 Dominion 

Rathamas Corporation 

League of Haritana 

HIP 114135 Empire League 

Omana Natural Network 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
