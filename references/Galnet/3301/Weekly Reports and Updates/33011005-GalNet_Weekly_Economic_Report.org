GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 3,066 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Samkyha State Network 

Maljenni Netcoms Commodities 

Lan Tzak Jet General Corporation 

Defence Force of HR 8793 

Purple Creative Industry 

Maridal Commodities 

Karsuki Ti Purple Electronics 

q1 Eridani Gold Crew 

United Umbrigua Conservatives 

Orang Purple Fortune and Co 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
