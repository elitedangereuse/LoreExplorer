GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,113 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Labour of Har Itariu 

United Nganji Labour 

LHS 2931 Gold Major Network 

Imperial Law Party 

Crimson Allied Incorporated 

Defence Party of Branglal 

Santjalan Jet Organisation 

Karamojola Dynasty 

Liberals of Ngolibardu 

Ambiri allied 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor factionâ€™s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
