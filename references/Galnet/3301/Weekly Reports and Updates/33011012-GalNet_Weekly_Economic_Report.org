* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/12 Oct 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 6,333 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Liberty Party of Tau Ceti	 

Official Palengue Liberty Party 

LP 681-91 Ring 

Sibio Purple Power Systems 

Dakshu Partners 

Rathakako Shared 

Crimson Dynamic Commodities 

Kapurri Empire League 

CD-54 9671 Patron's Principles 

HIP 100685 Purple Travel Limited 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
