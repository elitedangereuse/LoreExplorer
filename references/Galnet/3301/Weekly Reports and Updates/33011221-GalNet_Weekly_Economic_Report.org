* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/21 Dec 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 10,971 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

HIP 16365 Commodities 

LHS 2884 Dominion 

Ingamba Emperor's Grace 

Liberals of G 165-13 

Wolf 225 Federal Industry 

Tapany Netcoms Systems 

League of Itza 

Petra Camorra 

Labour Union of HIP 97950 

Segontiaci Imperial Society 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 1,420 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Korazotz Boys 

United Tellus Order 

Ross 346 Crimson Electronics 

Revolutionary Party of Diaguandri 

Potriti Flag 

TZ Arietis Purple Council 

Narakapani One 

Apurui Citizens' Forum 

HIP 51197 Central Services 

Kruger 60 and Co 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
