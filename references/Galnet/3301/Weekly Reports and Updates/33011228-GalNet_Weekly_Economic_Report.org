* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/28 Dec 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 11,053 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

LHS 6128 Blue Investments Corp. 

Bonitou Jet General Network 

Avaticus Crimson Crew 

Tepi Services 

Wolf 1431 Purple Partnership 

Cartel of Galandandes 

Belaba United 

LTT 135 Empire Consulate 

LHS 2405 Jet Allied Co 

Blue Major Exchange 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 1,304 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Toco Silver Comms Network 

Order of Njorog	 

United Tellus Order 

Bylgit Boys 

Bragur United Group 

TZ Arietis Purple Council 

Narakapani One 

Apurui Citizens' Forum 

HIP 51197 Central Services 

Kruger 60 and Co 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
