GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,004 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

League of Xeretes 

Barnard's Star Crimson Society 

Traditional Nahuaru Party 

Nariansan Guardians of Tradition 

Umbrigua Inc 

Cubeo Purple Deeds Ltd 

Union of Yawa Unionists 

Bilfrost Alliance Bridge 

United NLTT 13249 Resistance 

HIP 105408 Nationalists 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
