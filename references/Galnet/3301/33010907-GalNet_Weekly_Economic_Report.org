GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,373 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

LTT 15278 Gang 

Umbrigua Blue Pirates 

New Kuki An Labour 

Aeduwona Holdings 

LHS 2260 Brotherhood 

Lan Tzak Purple Dragons 

Viracocha Partners 

CD-54 471 Exchange 

Arugh Organisation 

G 139-3 and Co 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor factionâ€™s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
