"This just goes to show that the demand for onionhead is a strong as ever, despite the Federation's attempts to quash it. I want to say a big thank you to all the traders who made the journey to Xelabara, and to all the pilots who helped clear the pirates from our spaceways. You guys rock!" 

Romero announced that all those who contributed to the appeal could collect their rewards from Navigator Market in Xelabara.
