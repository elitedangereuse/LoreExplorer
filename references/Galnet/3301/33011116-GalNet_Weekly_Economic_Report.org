* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/16 Nov 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 7,434 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Nanter Company 

United Ao Progressive Party 

Shokwakw Future 

LP 167-71 PLC 

Wolf 54 Crimson Cartel 

Manianscudo Energy Group 

Social Wolf 333 Liberals 

Blue Transport Exchange 

Partnership of HIP 97567 

Zeaex Flag 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
