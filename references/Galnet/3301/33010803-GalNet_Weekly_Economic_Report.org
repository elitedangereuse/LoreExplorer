GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

Here are 10 of the 3,995 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Gyton's Hope Resistance 

Beldarkri Constitution Party 

Progressive Party of No Myoin 

Obambivas Netcoms Ltd 

Codorain Network 

New HIP 60953 Constitution Party 

Gender Flag 

Obambivas United Industries 

Narakapani Exchange 

Lactonacaya Empire League 

When in boom, the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 93 minor factions currently experiencing an economic bust: 

Wolf 1301 Crimson Electronics 

LTT 9097 Gold Advanced Co 

LHS 1197 Gold Family 

HR 692 Empire League 

HR 826 Movement 

Official AZ Cancri Dominion 

Mob of Groombridge 34 

NLTT 12619 Confederacy 

Forculus Ltd 

Values Party of Jitani 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
