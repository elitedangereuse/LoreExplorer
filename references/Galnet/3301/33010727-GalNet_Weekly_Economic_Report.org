GalNet Weekly Economic Report 
 
In this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*). 

The following 10 of the 4204 minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Family of Euryale 

Hajo Order 

Ditibi Services 

Witou Empire League 

Meinjhalara Transport Services 

Alliance of Cileni 

Miquitagat Empire Assembly 

Social LTT 7453 Free 

Revolutionary Party of Lu Wang 

Independents of Kappa Fornacis 

When in boom the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

These minor factions are suffering an economic bust: 

NLTT 12619 Confederacy 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
