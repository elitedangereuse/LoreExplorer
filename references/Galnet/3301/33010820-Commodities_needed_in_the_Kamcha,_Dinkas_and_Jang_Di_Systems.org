* Commodities needed in the Kamcha, Dinkas and Jang Di Systems

Commodities needed in the Kamcha, Dinkas and Jang Di Systems 
 
A mysterious organisation called Emperor’s Dawn has issued open contracts for a diverse selection of commodities: Ceremonial Heike Tea, Battle Weapons, and Toxic Waste. Each of these is to be delivered to a specific starport, as outlined below: 

Battle Weapons should be taken to Saarinen Station in the Kamcha system 

Ceremonial Heike Tea should be taken to Sikorsky Orbital in the Jang Di system 

Toxic Waste should be taken to Blaauw Port in the Dinkas system 

Little is known about Emperor’s Dawn, but it seems that the curiously-named organisation, which is based in the Kamcha system, has access to considerable resources, as it is throwing a lot of money at this commercial endeavour. Pilots of a mercantile disposition would do well to consider participating in this effort, as there is certainly an opportunity for resourceful traders to make a tidy profit.
