* The Canonn Supports Palin's Effort

/21 Dec 3301/

Professor Ishmael Palin has requested help in establishing a new research base on Maia B1BA in order to safely study the unknown artefacts. Dr Arcanonn, head of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has issued a statement regarding this endeavour: 

"I cannot argue with the logic of establishing a research facility out in the Pleiades, next door to Merope, and I urge all Commanders to deliver as many Evacuation Shelters as they can to Nelson Works in Dahan to ensure this facility is completed." 

"With the Canonn throwing its resources at this initiative, I will be contacting the professor personally to request laboratory space for my researchers so that we, too, can be involved once the base is established." 

"Research into the UAs is not a side project for humanity - it is vital. Make sure you're one of those making a difference." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
