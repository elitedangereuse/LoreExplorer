Grand Sale of Slaves in Carns 
 
Following up on yesterday’s surprise announcement of changing economic policy in the Carns system, Deputy Communications Officer Ramon Lamor outlined further changes: 

“In the fine traditions of the Empire, our extraction facilities relied on the unyielding efforts of our imperial slave workforce. Their devoted service has been the foundation of our historical success. However, in these changing times we need a new skillset to drive the economy. Some of those slaves who possess the correct aptitude or skills are already being prepared for their new roles. For the majority, we are seeking new opportunities for them to continue showing their personal value.” 

He went on to explain that the authorities will finance a substantial discount for slaves sold at Humason Orbital. This discount will remain in place until all our imperial slaves have found new places to work.
