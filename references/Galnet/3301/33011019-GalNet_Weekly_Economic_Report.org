* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/19 Oct 3301/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 11,041 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

People's Meldrith Values Party 

Movement for LHS 2429 Democrats 

Allied LHS 380 Law Party 

Isita Confederation 

Tefenhua Alliance Union 

Bharu Silver Public Partners 

Gakiutl Blue Mafia 

Carthage Silver Drug Empire 

Maitis Energy Company 

Theta Indi Advanced Incorporated 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.
