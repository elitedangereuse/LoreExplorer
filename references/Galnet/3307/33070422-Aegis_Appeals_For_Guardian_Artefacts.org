* Aegis Appeals For Guardian Artefacts

/22 Apr 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Ancient objects left behind by the Guardians have been requested by Aegis for a new anti-xeno research programme.  

The Guardians were an intelligent humanoid species whose civilisation collapsed over a million years ago, and who were engaged in hostilities with the Thargoid race. 

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis Research, gave this statement: 

“At the Galactic Summit, Aegis agreed to undertake a fresh analysis of Guardian technology. The hope is that this will lead to the development of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require new samples to compare with Ram Tah’s groundbreaking work on this mysterious species.” 

“Guardian artefacts including those previously identified as caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns are needed. These can be unearthed from the ancient ruins scattered across dozens of worlds.” 

“I beseech the galactic community to support this project. It is vital that Aegis continues to receive funding, and to achieve this we must push the boundaries of our knowledge even further.” 

Pilots are asked to deliver their shipments to Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.
