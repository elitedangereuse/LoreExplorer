* Hyford’s Cache Reveals Mysterious Project

/31 Aug 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

A data bank left by a crashed vessel on the moon Colonia 5 e a has reactivated, revealing clues as to its origin. 

The crash site was first discovered over four years ago via listening posts in the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems. These posts held transmissions from the ship’s owner, Commander Hyford, discussing his attempts to avoid members of a private military outfit he had previously worked for. 

This latest development was discussed by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency: 

“Commander Hyford spoke of making deliveries to a nameless organisation in the Pleiades, and left a data cache in the Colonia system that provided further details. Hyford’s Cache, as some investigators referred to it, had remained locked until a manually-set timer system finally expired last week. The information within has apparently directed pilots to investigate the HIP 26176 system.” 

“It’s possible that Kit Fowler’s recent theories regarding Black Flight – another old mystery – might prove relevant after all. But there are bigger questions that need answering. Who was Hyford working for? Were they responsible for causing his ship to crash? And if so, what secrets were they trying to keep?”
