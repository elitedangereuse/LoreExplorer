* The Death of Theta Seven

/13 Dec 3307/

The NMLA’s de facto leader and his closest followers have sacrificed themselves by destroying the Far God cult’s megaship Sacrosanct. 

The hijacked vessel had been taken to the Mudhrid system by the remaining members of Theta Group, aiming to reunite with the NMLA. After this failed, ACT forces surrounded the Sacrosanct in the hope of rescuing the several thousand cultists being kept as hostages. 

Theta Seven broadcast a short video message, where he uttered a single phrase: 

“The future will remember us.” 

He was then seen to manually detonate a series of bombs, which ruptured the Sacrosanct’s hull and split the vessel in two. It is believed that the weapons also distributed Thargoid caustic enzymes throughout the megaship, thereby killing its entire population. 

ACT has released a statement from co-leader Captain Saskia Landau: 

“Tragically we were unable to save the lives of the Far God worshippers, despite several attempts to negotiate their safe conduct off the ship. Captain Castile’s commando unit could not gain entry to the Sacrosanct in time, and we had no success trying to hack into its onboard computers.” 

“We can confirm that the most wanted terrorist in the galaxy is dead. But ACT’s task is not yet complete, since there is much we still don’t know about the NMLA. Our investigation will focus on learning more about their background, as well as targeting any surviving cells of activists.”
