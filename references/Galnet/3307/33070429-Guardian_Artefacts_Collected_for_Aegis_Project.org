* Guardian Artefacts Collected for Aegis Project

/29 Apr 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Aegis’s anti-xeno research programme has launched with the mass delivery of artefacts constructed by the Guardians. 

Many ancient caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns were found in the ruins of the mysterious civilisation that collapsed over a million years ago. Pilots then transported these to the Delphi system for analysis. 

Professor Alba Tesreau made this announcement: 

“Everyone at Aegis is thankful for the impressive effort made by the galactic community. If we can gain new insights into Guardian technology from these samples, then funding and resources for our work may continue.” 

Aegis has agreed to pursue the development of weaponry and defences that might prove more effective against the Thargoids. However, as yet the research is in its early stages and there are no signs of imminent breakthroughs. 

Pilots who delivered Guardian artefacts can now collect their rewards from Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.
