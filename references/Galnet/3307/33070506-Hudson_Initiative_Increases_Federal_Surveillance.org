* Hudson Initiative Increases Federal Surveillance

/06 May 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

President Zachary Hudson’s call for data deliveries has enhanced civilian surveillance within the Federation. 

His campaign received more data than a competing request from Shadow President Felicia Winters, which aimed to offer ways of protecting communications against interception by the Proactive Detection Bureau. 

For both initiatives, pilots delivered anomalous bulk scan data, exceptional scrambled emission data, specialised legacy firmware and unusual encrypted files. 

President Zachary Hudson hailed this show of public support for the Federal government: 

“Our citizens deserve security, and with their contributions to the PDB’s databases, we are now in a better position to protect them against terrorism.” 

Analysts predict that this outcome will boost security for systems that fall within Hudson’s personal sphere of influence. It is also expected that a loss of public support will reduce stability within systems where Winters has authority. 

Pilots who supported President Hudson can now collect their rewards from Gresley Dock in the Nanomam system. 

Pilots who supported Shadow President Winters can now collect their rewards from Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.
