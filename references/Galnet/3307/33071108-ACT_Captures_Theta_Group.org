* ACT Captures Theta Group

/08 Nov 3307/

The creators of the NMLA’s caustic enzyme bombs have been arrested, although the terrorist figurehead Theta Seven remains at large. 

Theta Group is directly responsible for 17 starport bombings conducted by the NMLA across the core systems. These attacks resulted in a combined death toll of almost 800,000 people, with twice as many suffering serious injury. 

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit’s co-leaders, told the media: 

“We have finally tracked down the NMLA’s bomb-making engineers, and a joint task force made the arrest with minimal casualties. Large quantities of Thargoid corrosives and explosive components were also seized.” 

“This achievement was only possible due to intercepting Theta Group’s communications with Neo-Marlinist sympathisers. We are unsure why the NMLA’s dark-comms network was not used in that instance.” 

“As our intel predicted, the group’s leader Theta Seven was not among those we captured. We have confirmed that he and a handful of followers disappeared after the bombings in July, anticipating their imminent capture. ACT will not rest until the galaxy’s most wanted terrorist has been brought to justice.” 

The name ‘Theta Group’ was assigned to the bomb-makers during their incarceration at Serene Harbour, an Imperial Intelligence penal facility in the R CrA Sector AF-A d42 system. After escaping, their leader adopted his prisoner designation – Theta Seven – as a reaction to what he viewed as dehumanising treatment of Neo-Marlinists by the Empire.
