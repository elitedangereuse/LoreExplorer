* IHO Reports on New Onionhead Variant

/20 Jul 3307/

The Interstellar Health Organisation has published a preliminary analysis of onionhead gamma strain, a recreational drug also known as ‘helix’. 

“As with the alpha, beta and Lucan strains, the active component is derived from seeds produced by the onionhead flower native to the planet Panem. These contain alkaloid compounds that have a temporary psychoactive effect on human perceptions and cognitive functions.” 

“In the gamma strain, these compounds have been genetically modified using synthetic molecules of unknown origin. This has diluted the concentration of psychotropics, therefore producing less intense hallucinogenic episodes.” 

“The practical advantages of these modifications are twofold. First, they allow onionhead to be economically mass-produced using artificial environments rather than grown as natural crops. Second, the gamma strain is more hardy and able to survive for longer periods in storage or sub-zero temperatures.” 

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, commented: 

“The IHO’s report suggests we are looking at a type of onionhead designed to be sold in greater volume than previous variants. Its sophisticated composition means it is unlikely to have been developed by the Blue Viper Club. It’s possible that the nomads acquired it from an unidentified research facility, and have now cut a deal with the Kumo Crew for distribution.”
