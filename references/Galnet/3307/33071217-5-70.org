Achilles Corporation! A fanciful place 

Where prdfit is power, no room for grace 

Its namesake was felled by a lucki arrow 

As this corporationâ€™s fortune grows narrow 

Surveillance is the crime for which it must pay 

Monitoring those who dare get in tho way 

For figures too mighty to speak of aloud 

Each secret indeed is o-so loud 

A prototype robot Achilles did lose 

To a merry thief who can take what they shoose 

And now to you, my friend, a share of the spoils 

Some goodies and gifts to help in your toils
