* Galactic Mysteries: The Adamastor

/10 Mar 3307/

Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe, two detectives from the Wallglass Investigations Agency, examine the background of the Adamastor megaship. 

Gunnarson: “When Wolfe and I started this project, we knew this case would come first. We’re both protégés of Benjamin Chester, creator of the Wallglass Archive. He retired years ago, but that old spark kicked in when a ‘ghost ship’ turned up on his doorstep!” 

“The Adamastor is a 200 year old derelict that drifted into the Chukchan system on autopilot. It’s still there, with the Alliance Salvage Guild poking through its guts. Chester investigated its owners, a super-secretive company called Azimuth Biochemicals. We don’t know what they were searching for, but what they found was possibly the first recorded Thargoid encounter.” 

“I’ve since tracked down evidence that the Adamastor had a sister ship – the Hesperus – which in 3113 was sent to… somewhere! Neither ship returned, but we only know what happened on the Adamastor mission. Of course, Wolfe had to go see that with her own eyes.” 

Wolfe: “Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 is a busy system nowadays, but was unexplored when Professor Carver’s survey team were there. Listening to their logs from two centuries ago while examining the research base was chilling… ghost voices from a ghost ship.” 

“There was evidence of blast scars, but I’ve seen enough battlefields to know what exchanged gunfire looks like. Azimuth’s mercenaries weren’t just firing at Thargoids, but at someone who shot back with laser rifles.” 

“Gunnarson tells me Azimuth was swallowed up by a rival called Pharmasapien. Did they infiltrate the Adamastor and try to take over? Or did the thing that Carver captured drive everyone insane?” 

“This is a seriously cold case, even for us. But maybe one day, more tantalising clues will emerge. And that’s what we live for.”
