* President Winters Assumes Office

/31 Oct 3310/

The inauguration ceremony has taken place to formally swear in Felicia Winters as the president of the Federation. 

President Winters made a public address from the White House in Olympus Village on Mars: 

“I pledge to work for the benefit of each and every individual within our Federation. My administration will redirect funding away from corporations toward improving health, public services and quality of life. Together, we will launch a new era of optimism and opportunity!” 

“My first act is to order the Federal Intelligence Agency to shut down the Proactive Detection Bureau. The illegal surveillance of all communication ends now. We will propose to Congress that the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act of 3307 is revoked, allowing our Federal Accord to uphold each citizen’s constitutional right to privacy.” 

The presidential election was held in October 3309, when Felicia Winters eclipsed her rival Jerome Archer by four per cent of the vote. Her inauguration was delayed for a number of reasons, including the personal tragedy affecting the Winters family after disastrous earthquakes on Rhea 3. 

President Winters is supported by Vice President Isolde Rochester, matriarch of the famous Rochester family. The Liberal Party will now form a new Federal government, led by a hand-picked Cabinet. This includes Congressmen Kristine Lasky as Secretary of State, Conn Montgomery as Secretary for Defence, Bai Zheng as Secretary for Security, and Pierre-Marc Pelletier as Grand Attorney. 

Former President Zachary Hudson has officially vacated the office, having served since 3301. His successor, Shadow President Jerome Archer, will now lead the Republican Party as the opposition.
