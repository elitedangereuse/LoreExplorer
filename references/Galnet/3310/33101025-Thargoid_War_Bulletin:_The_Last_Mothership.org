* Thargoid War Bulletin: The Last Mothership

/25 Oct 3310/

Titan Raijin in the Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3 system has been destroyed, leaving only Cocijo still operational. 

Aden Tanner, anti-xeno strategist for Aegis, provided a brief statement: 

“My heart still soars to hear that another Titan has been taken down. Until very recently, these colossal constructs were seen as indestructible. Aegis was even drawing up long-term strategies based around them being permanently present in human space. The Guardian nanite torpedo, and the hard work of so many pilots, has made that academic.” 

“Anti-xeno pilots are already travelling to the systems surrounding Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18, to repeat the process one last time on Titan Cocijo. With such a concentrated effort, it is not expected to last long. However, I must repeat my earlier call for caution and preparedness. We cannot tell how the Thargoids will respond to the loss of their last mothership, and we may face unknown weaponry or tactics.”
