* Mandalay Released: Zorgon Peterson’s SCO-Friendly Explorer Ships Out

/31 Oct 3310/

The first run of Mandalay ships has been delivered to shipyards across the core systems and are now available for purchase. 

Zorgon Peterson’s Mandalay is the third new vessel to be optimised for Achilles Aerospace’s SCO frame shift drive – following the Python Mk. II and the Type-8 - and aims to become the premier medium-sized exploration craft. 

Chief Marketing Officer Devin Kaneda sent a press statement to all shipyard outlets: 

“The Mandalay allows pilots to achieve a considerable jump range while maintaining the manoeuverability of its size class, expanding the range of future exploration voyages of its size class. Our technicians have ensured that the ship’s handling in atmospheric conditions is exceptional, easing the travel down to undiscovered worlds.” 

“A rethink of structural stress resistance, in cooperation with Achilles engineers, has resulted in the Mandalay taking full advantage of the SCO frame shift drive. We believe this vessel is an exceptional package for pilots who wish to explore the galaxy efficiently, comfortably and in style.” 

Notable at the Mandalay’s release party was the lack of a representative of Sirius Corporation. Rumours of an ongoing disagreement between representatives and Zorgon Peterson management over Achilles’ design input have grown in volume in recent weeks.
