* Type-8 Released: Lakon Spaceways Offer SCO Optimised Freighter

/07 Aug 3310/

The first batch of Type-8 freighters are now available for purchase, expanding Lakon Spaceways’ fleet of dedicated trade vessels. 

Lakon's promotional media contained the following statement: 

“With the Type-8, Lakon Spaceways introduces a ‘best-in-class' medium freighter. The aesthetically charming design offers a larger cargo capacity and greater resilience compared to similarly sized trade ships.” 

“Since Achilles Corporation’s SCO frame shift drive reached the market, the latest challenge for modern ship design is to endure the unique stresses generated by overcharged supercruise. Lakon is proud to have passed this challenge triumphantly. Type-8 pilots can travel between nav beacons and starports in a fraction of the time, with a much lower level of risk than our competitors can currently offer.” 

“The Type-8 is a fine choice for any entrepreneur looking to maximise the profitability of their trade routes.” 

The ship’s official dimensions make it the largest medium-class vessel available to the public. Early reviews confirm that the Type-8 is effective at minimising the downsides of SCO frame shift drive travel, much like Faulcon DeLacy’s recently released Python Mk II.
