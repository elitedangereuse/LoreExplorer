* Seo Jin-ae Awake, Releases Unauthorised Warning

/24 Oct 3310/

Reports that Aegis special advisor Seo Jin-ae has woken from a week-long coma were followed by a statement by Seo, which was sent to all major newsfeeds. 

Aegis medical personnel had confirmed earlier in the day that Seo had abruptly woken from unconsciousness, following a significant seizure on October 18th. There were no long-term physical concerns, and she was expected to make a full recovery. 

However, less than two hours later, Seo released a statement via ICE-cast. The raw footage was self-recorded and is believed to have been made without Aegis command’s authorisation. 

“I hate making these public announcements, so don’t expect it to be good”, she explained. “But everyone keeps telling me how important I am to the war effort, so why not test that and see if anyone listens? There’s something everybody needs to know. What happened to me wasn’t an accident or an illness.” 

“Right before I passed out there was a noise in my head. It was like someone plugged an amplifier straight into my brain. I couldn’t stop it, and it hurt like you wouldn’t believe. It’s still echoing in my skull somewhere. But more than that, I could feel it. Moving through my consciousness.” 

“My memories rushed past me in a blur. I couldn’t stop it. It felt like everything I’ve ever known, learned or whatever... Just spinning and spinning around. Even in a coma, I could feel it. The Thargoids had finally noticed my presence and tried to learn what they could about me – which also means everything I know about humans. They scraped it out of my mind. I’m sorry that I couldn’t stop it. I’m sorry.” 

“But I can still hear the Thargoid mind. I guess they’re done with me. They’re planning something now. Listen to Aegis – they'll do everything they can to fix this.” 

Ivano Colombera, the Imperial research lead for the Aegis project, has speculated that the cortical implant which grants Seo the ability to hear the Thargoid hive mind may have disrupted an attempt to control her like a drone. No other statement from Aegis has yet been made.
