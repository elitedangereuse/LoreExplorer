* Titan Cocijo Destroyed, Sol Liberated

/18 Dec 3310/

The last remaining Thargoid Titan has been destroyed in the Sol system, following weeks of fierce fighting between Thargoid and human AX pilots. 

Titan Cocijo entered a meltdown state 24 hours ago, after pilots were able to jam its heat vents to trigger an overload of heat within the giant mothership. Shortly before detonation, the last remaining Thargoid vessels were seen entering portals to leave the system. No Thargoid ships remain in Sol. 

President Felicia Winters, speaking from Feynman in Eta Cassiopeiae, announced victory in the Battle for Sol via all newsfeeds: 

“This is a historic moment in human history. We have fought together against an alien invader who sought to dominate us. In this moment, today, we have triumphed. The heart of the Federation was the Thargoid’s final target, and with Aegis’ support the Federation stood firm. Now we look to rebuild, refocus and move forward.” 

Professor Alba Tesreau also provided a statement on behalf of Aegis: 

“It is important to recognise the significance of our victory. When coming together as one, working side-by-side regardless of identity or allegiance, we have proven that humanity can withstand significant challenges and move forward, arm in arm, towards the future. But in such moments, we remember those who have been taken from us – the selfless, the heroic and the loved. It will take time to heal. We thank the efforts of all those who defended us against the Thargoids, due to which so many of us remain to mourn the lost.” 

Words of support from Allied and Imperial figures have been exchanged, though some Federal ICE-Casters have drawn attention to the lack of military support from the other superpowers during Cocijo’s assault on Sol. 

The repair of all offline ports in Sol has been highlighted as the next priority. Shipments of materials needed to complete the restoration of these locations are needed in Sol and neighbouring systems which experienced Thargoid invasion. 

Refugees numbering in the billions remain homeless, still living in temporary shelters assigned by Rescue Megaship processing teams. Many of these refugees are reluctant to return to their home systems and are looking for new opportunities among the stars. 

Participants in the assault on Titan Cocijo can now collect their rewards from Rescue Ship Hutner in the Luyten’s Star system.
