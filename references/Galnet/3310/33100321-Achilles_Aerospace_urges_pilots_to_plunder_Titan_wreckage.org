* Achilles Aerospace urges pilots to plunder Titan wreckage

/21 Mar 3310/

Intense investment into research on Titan travel has been announced by the aerospace subdivision of the famed robotics company. 

Their research has been centred on the method used by the Thargoid Titans to travel at speeds well beyond that of humanity’s current technological capacity. 

A spokesperson for Achilles Aerospace had this to say: 

“For so long now, the means of space travel have been controlled by one company in a strict monopoly. Under that monopoly, progress seems to have stagnated entirely. But Achilles is a corporation built on the iteration and refinement of technology, and we intend to bring space travel into a new age.” 

“We have been limited to observational data alone so far, but that is no longer the case. The remnant of Taranis is now accessible, and within it lies the missing component to our work. We urge pilots to venture to the wreckage of the destroyed Titan and try to obtain one of the rare Titan Drive Components. Achilles Aerospace will pay generously for any that are sold to Bloch Station in the Ethgreze system.” Experts warn that the Taranis site remains extremely dangerous. Caustic sinks should be equipped, and care should be taken due to reports of Thargoid ships active in the area.
