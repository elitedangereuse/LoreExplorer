* Titan Cocijo Devastates Sol System

/05 Dec 3310/

The Thargoid Titan Cocijo has arrived in the Sol system, positioning itself in orbit around Earth. 

Cocijo’s arrival unleashed a devastating regional assault by the remaining Thargoid invasion fleet. In Sol, only Mars High, Galileo and Haberlandt Survey remain functional, albeit damaged, with all other ports knocked offline by Thargoid attack. Farragut battlecruisers FNS Nero and FNS Erebus have been destroyed, while FNS Victory and FNS Trander are marshaling system defence efforts. Thousands of AX fleet vessels have been lost to the initial conflict. 

16 other systems were assaulted near Sol, triggering a massive refugee crisis as billions of civilians remain stranded in the region. Rescue megaships are en route to support evacuation efforts. 

Starship One has successfully arrived in Eta Cassiopeiae, with President Winters and members of her cabinet on board. 

Aden Tanner, military advisor for Aegis, provided the following statement: 

“This is it, folks. The Thargoids have made their final attempt at checkmate. The birthplace of humanity and the centre of the Federation: Sol. Titan Cocijo has chosen to bring the fight to the core of human space.” 

“This is a fight like nothing we’ve ever seen. The Thargoids are hitting us aggressively and in huge numbers, with a Titan directly leading the attack. I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know that we’ve got a war to win. Civilians need our help, and Federal AX forces need our support. If you’ve got a ship and you’re willing to get involved, do so now. Humanity is going to remember this fight forever.”
