* 'Significant Medical Emergency’ Strikes Seo Jin-ae

/18 Oct 3310/

Seo Jin-ae, special advisor to the Aegis initiative, has suffered a ‘significant medical emergency’ according to reports from the Duamta system. 

A leak from within the Aegis medical facility reached media outlets early yesterday evening, claiming that Seo had suddenly fallen ill. The source also claimed that Seo was registering incredibly high brain activity while unconscious. 

The intense speculation resulted in a surprise response from Head of Aegis, Alba Tesreau, only hours later. 

Her brief statement was delivered by a spokesperson outside the facility to gathered journalists: 

“While it is unfortunate that a member of our staff decided to leak this information, the news is true. I have chosen to confirm the claims myself, rather than let speculation and falsehoods grow about Seo’s condition.” 

“Approximately sixteen hours ago, Seo experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The convulsions stopped within a few minutes, but she is yet to wake. Aegis medical experts are providing the best possible care as they determine the cause of this episode.” 

“Until then, please allow the staff here to do what they do best without distraction from those hungry for information. We will provide an update on Seo when there is something to share.” 

Seo is known for her unique ability to interpret Thargoid communications, due to a prototype cortical implant installed during the Project Seraph experiments. It is believed that her insight has proven highly valuable to Aegis tactical briefings, but Seo’s level of involvement has never been fully detailed.
