* De Caminha Station Has Been Successfully Reinforced

/13 Jun 3310/

The pirates attacking De Caminha have been eliminated, and supplies have been provided to prevent further attacks. 

Jerome Archer offered his thanks in an announcement this morning: 

“Time and time again, I am impressed by the skill and compassion of the galaxy’s pilots. Security for Federation citizens is my number one priority, and it pains me that a station in our space could be the target of opportunistic low lives, but through your efforts this station is once again secure and ready if those pirates return. Rewards are now available to those who helped in the defence efforts.” 

“But I am compelled to raise the question on everyone’s mind: will this situation be better when Felicia Winters finally assumes office? A President-elect who, I remind you, seems uninterested in the security of her citizens. Who wants to shut down resources like the PDB, which has saved many, many lives already.” 

“Is she a president capable of maintaining peace, when aggressors are increasingly appearing from all sides?” 

“Or is she a president who puts her ideals before the lives of her people?” 

“I once again urge congress to reconsider allowing Zachary Hudson another term as President of the Federation in light of Winters’ ongoing, conspicuous, absence.”
