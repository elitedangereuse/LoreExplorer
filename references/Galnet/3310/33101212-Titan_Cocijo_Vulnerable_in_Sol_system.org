* Titan Cocijo Vulnerable in Sol system

/12 Dec 3310/

The last remaining Thargoid Titan, Cocijo, is now vulnerable to attack following a concerted effort by AX forces. 

Thargoid forces have been pushed back from systems around Sol, where Titan Cocijo currently hangs in orbit above Earth. The lack of support from these systems, as with other Titans previously, have left Cocijo exposed to a direct assault. 

Aden Tanner, special military advisor to Aegis, provided the following update via all Federal news feeds: 

“This is our chance to put an end to the Thargoid invasion once and for all. After two years of struggle, sacrifice and bravery, our pilots have risked their lives once more to protect humanity from the greatest threat our people have ever known.” 

“We have many pilots still out there – many of which have fought from the very first Titan’s arrival. If you’re able, they could use your support. Ships equipped with Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser, Caustic Sink Launchers, and a Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon will be capable of navigating the Maelstrom around Cocijo to strike the Titan’s Heat Vents, ultimately forcing a meltdown state.” 

Pilots looking to join the fight against Titan Cocijo should outfit their ships accordingly and join the Battle for Sol. Aegis scanners will record any damage inflicted on Cocijo by individual ships, so pilots will not need to register at a port prior to participation.
