* Empire Continues ‘Protective Sanctuary’ for Abductees

/04 Jan 3310/

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has decided that all Imperial citizens recovered from Thargoid Titans will remain in quarantine indefinitely. 

An official pronouncement on behalf of the Emperor was distributed by the Imperial Palace: 

“Every subject of the Empire who was abducted by the Thargoids is receiving the highest possible quality of treatment and support. The Emperor has ordered that they will be given exemplary medical and psychological care, for as long as they remain in medical isolation.” 

“As is always the case, the security of our society is paramount. Protective sanctuary is being provided for tens of thousands of individuals, in order that billions are spared the prospect – however unlikely – of an alien influence taking root within the Empire. That is the honourable path, and the Emperor is confident her people will understand the wisdom of this decision.” 

The Imperial Herald’s political journalist Cassia Carvalho analysed the ramifications: 

“It is unusual for the actions of other superpowers to be acknowledged these days, but the issue of detaining Thargoid abductees has crossed all borders. In this case, the Alliance’s decision to allow them to return home has prompted Her Majesty to insist that keeping them in isolation is for the greater good.” 

“Court insiders revealed that Princess Aisling Duval sought a personal audience with the Emperor, hoping to convince her to lift the quarantine. I’m told that this was refused in no uncertain terms, coupled with the suggestion that the Princess should focus her attention on her Aegis assignment.” 

“The Imperial Palace also responded to Kamadhenu Medipure, which has called for all abductees to be relocated to deep space and possibly euthanised. The company was thanked for its ‘robust proposals’, but instructed to leave such considerations to the Senate.”
