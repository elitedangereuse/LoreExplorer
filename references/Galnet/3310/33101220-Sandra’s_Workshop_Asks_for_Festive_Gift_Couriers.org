* Sandra’s Workshop Asks for Festive Gift Couriers

/20 Dec 3310/

The CEO of leading children’s toy manufacturer Sandra’s Workshop has requested help with parcel deliveries. 

Sandra Corrs, the much-loved philanthropist who provides gifts to children across the core systems each year, made a similar request two years ago. Then, with the Thargoid invasion just beginning, her courier fleet was loaned out to help refugee evacuation efforts. 

This year a different problem has emerged just as the Thargoid Invasion appears to be over, as Sandra explained to Vox Galactica: 

“Our Dolph’s Routes transport fleet has been upgraded and fitted to increase delivery capacity. Or, as we like to say in the workshop: ‘ferry even more joy’, haha! But we’ve discovered a rather irksome snag: with so many little boys and girls displaced by the nasty alien invasion, it’s going to be a challenge finding them all!” 

“Even our fleet won’t be able to deliver all our presents on time, given the extra work needed to track down their proper delivery points. We’ll need to rely on kind-hearted pilots to volunteer their time and ensure we can brighten the smiles on every child on our list.” 

Pilots willing to help Sandra’s Workshop can collect festive gifts from the Frost Dock outpost in the Njambalba system. The outpost can only provide landing pads for small- and medium-sized vessels. A beacon outside Frost Dock holds delivery information which can be acquired via scan.
