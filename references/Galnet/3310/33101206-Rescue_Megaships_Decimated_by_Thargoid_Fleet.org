* Rescue Megaships Decimated by Thargoid Fleet

/06 Dec 3310/

Almost all rescue megaships deployed to systems near Sol have been destroyed shortly after arrival, Aegis has confirmed. 

Eight of the eleven active rescue megaships were ordered to systems close to Sol to help with the expected high flow of refugees and civilian casualties following Titan Cocijo’s arrival. But distress calls were sounded within minutes of arrival with the few recovered survivors claiming the Thargoids had arrived in alarming numbers at the precise arrival location. 

The following rescue megaships have been lost: 

- Federal Haven in Sol 

- Rescue Ship Bertschinger in Sol 

- Rescue Ship Foerster in Sol 

- Rescue Ship Kisseih in Wolf 359 

- Rescue Ship Cavell in Alpha Centauri 

- Rescue Ship Yoshida in Barnard's Star 

- Rescue Ship Seacole in Wise 1506+7027 

Two rescue megaships have so far not been attacked and are orchestrating evacuation efforts for Sol and surrounding systems: 

- Rescue Ship Hutner in Luyten’s Star 

- Rescue Ship Cornwallis in V886 Centauri 

The Allied Solace and Imperial Sanctum rescue megaships were not deployed towards Sol and remain in their respective locations of Sun Wen and Hixkaramu. Given this alarming news, it seems unlikely they will be sent into the dangerous area around Sol now.
