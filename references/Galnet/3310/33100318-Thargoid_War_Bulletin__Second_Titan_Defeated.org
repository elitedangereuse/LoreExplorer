* Thargoid War Bulletin: Second Titan Defeated

/18 Mar 3310/

Titan Leigong in the HIP 8887 system has been eliminated, following the same tactical approach used against Taranis.  

Vox Galactica’s Jade Sanderlyn reported: 

“Two of the eight Thargoid Titans have now been put out of action. Leigong suffered the same fate as Taranis, with its core being targeted by a sustained bombardment.” 

“Aegis is overjoyed at these results. Both Professor Palin and Ram Tah are being praised for their development of the Guardian nanite torpedo, which is crucial to these attacks. And word is spreading that the Thargoid war machine has suffered a critical defeat, one that may change the entire conflict. Can these victories be repeated a further six times?”
