* A New Dawn for Humanity?

With the Thargoid invasion force seemingly on the edge of defeat, political analysts have presented several arguments for what follows. 

The potential balance of power across the core systems will be heavily influenced by the ambitions of its primary players – perhaps crucially in the Federation, claims Jean-Daniel Moulin: 

“President Winters has finally taken up residence in the White House, ready to face a multitude of challenges. A depressed war economy, mass citizen displacement and a series of late-term policies implemented by the outgoing Zachary Hudson will keep her schedule full for months. Jeremy Archer stands opposite her in Congress, ready to pounce on any signs of weakness and eager to fully emerge from the long shadow of Hudson as the true leader of the Republican party.” 

On the Imperial front, Cassia Carvalho of the Imperial Herald has provided a summary of those most likely to benefit post-invasion: 

“Emperor Arissa remains the figurehead of Imperial authority, and the successful navigation of military, migrant and domestic challenges has only enhanced her popularity. Likewise for Senator Denton Patreus, whose tactical leadership during the Thargoid war reinforced his power as Admiral of the Fleet. Princess Aisling enjoys glowing praise from Aegis figures as part of the Imperial delegation to the anti-xeno initiative, particularly her focus on humanitarian operations. And Senator Zemina Torval seems poised to assume the position of Chancellor in the near future. What comes next for the continued glory of the Empire?” 

In the Alliance, Prime Minister Mahon faces his strongest opposition for some time in the Alliance, according to Vanya Driscoll of the Alliance Tribune: 

“There have been some accusations towards the Prime Minister of a lack of decisive leadership during the Thargoid invasion. His reliance on a military pact with Sirius Corporation to enhance the Alliance Defence Force’s AX capabilities awoke key dissenters to Mahon's otherwise popular rule – most notably from Councillor Nakato Kaine, whose anti-corporate stance and strong devotion to the Alliance’s founding ideals have won her plenty of support.” 

Various newsfeeds discussed other figures: Sirius Corporation’s continued influence over many aspects of the corporate landscape gives CEO Li Yong-Rui considerable power. Pranav Antal, Simguru of the Utopia, leads a far smaller but vital community of devotees convinced of their guide’s future-tech vision. 

Yuri Grom remains a prominent independent fleet commander – viewed as a principled liberator to some, and a ruthless dictator to others. Finally, the Pirate King Archon Delaine’s recent targeted attacks on Emperor Arissa and Shadow President Archer suggests he sees an opportunity to expand his criminal influence in the early post-Invasion era.
