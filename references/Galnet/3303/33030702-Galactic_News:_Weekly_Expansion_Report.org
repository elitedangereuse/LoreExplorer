* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/02 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Iptera Allied Corp. 

Wolf 217 Left Party 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Alliance of Yemakinni 

CD-44 10336 Industries 

Friends of Pirigen 

Gliese 9106 Partners 

Dukes of Finepatis 

Djinaura Brotherhood 

Kaleo Corporation 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Labour of Geras	 

Indi Crimson Netcoms Dev 

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State 

Mutujiali Empire Consulate 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Xuanduna Imperial Society 

Jaques 

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats 

Mabe Company 

Coalition of Bodedi  

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
