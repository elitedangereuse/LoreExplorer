* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/25 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 8593 Empire League 

V886 Centauri Future 

Liberals of Delta Pavonis 

Zeus Bureau 

Kuwemargl Patrons of Law 

Labour of Kalads 

Ciboney Empire Consulate 

Cordenet Group 

Defence Force of HR 8793 

Yhele Empire Party 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Official Darkates Freedom Party 

The Pilots Federation 

Iptera Allied Corp. 

Natural LP 811-17 Conservatives 

Heike Co 

Autocracy of Phi Gruis 

Partnership of LHS 2819 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
