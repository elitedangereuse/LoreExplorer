* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/25 Jun 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Alliance of Yemakinni 

Hraean United 

Selkit Crimson Raiders 

Socho Gold Raiders 

Hel Purple Energy Industry 

Kokara Galactic Exchange 

Gold General Corp. 

Sirius Hot2Cold 

Tujing Empire Party 

Values Party of Belis 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

HIP 73428 Exchange 

Independents of Mildeptu 

Alioth Pro-Alliance Group 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

Yenistani Guardians of Tradition 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Dinde Systems 

Briganu Confederacy 

Begovans Industry 

Mabe Company 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
