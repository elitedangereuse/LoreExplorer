* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/27 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Chicoana Silver Travel Corp. 

HIP 96289 Blue Major Inc 

110 Herculis Purple Natural PLC 

Annarr Dynamic Corp. 

Tphene Collective 

Revolutionary Eluskapu Partnership 

People's Tutumu Confederacy 

Kwarandji Comms Industries 

Lunguni First 

Bletii Inc 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Democrats of BD-02 4304 

Durius Dominion 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Bodb Dearg Order 

Yenistani Guardians of Tradition 

Brotherhood of Caerete 

Gilyadar Front 

Velnians Gold Transport Holdings 

Marquis du Ugrivaci 

Chimasates Blue United Org 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
