* Galactic News: Abandoned INRA Outpost Discovered

/12 Oct 3303/

A number of media feeds in the core systems have reported the discovery of an abandoned planetary outpost in the Hermitage system. 

The reports, together with images captured by independent pilots, indicate that the outpost was controlled by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a joint Federal-Imperial initiative established in the 3100s. 

Very little is known about the INRA, but reports from the time assert that it was established to address Thargoid incursions into human space, and that it developed a chemical weapon designed to target Thargoid technology. 

Reports that the site contains logs describing INRA research are currently being corroborated.
