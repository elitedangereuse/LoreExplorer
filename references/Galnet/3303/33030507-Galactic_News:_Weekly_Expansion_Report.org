* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/07 May 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Wolf 217 Left Party 

Jaques 

Alliance of Yemakinni 

Partnership of Bean 

HIP 113454 Crew 

HIP 65921 Silver Bridge Systems 

Velnians Gold Transport Holdings 

Marquis du Ugrivaci 

Gliese 9106 Partners 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Xuanduna Imperial Society 

Serrot Blue General Group 

BD+14 2955 Republic Party 

Coalition of Djagana 

GR 316 Silver Universal Group 

Posse of HIP 97337 

Bhumato Crimson Brothers 

Kumbia Ltd 

League of Benapem Focus 

Any Kutjara Legal Incorporated 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
