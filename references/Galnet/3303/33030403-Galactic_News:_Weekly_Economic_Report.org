* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/03 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Uru Federal Interstellar 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Cemiess Commodities  

Brani Federal Holdings  

Yakabugai Exchange  

Panoi Holdings 

HIP 8593 Empire League  

HIP 19773 Shared 

HIP 10570 Constitution Party 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Coalition of Ngaliba  

Lords of Ngaliba  

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Nang Ta-khian Public Co  

LHS 535 Silver United Ltd 

Huaich Independents 

Eshu Gold Mafia  

Sif League  

Honges Silver Drug Empire 

LP 64-194 Public Corp. 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
