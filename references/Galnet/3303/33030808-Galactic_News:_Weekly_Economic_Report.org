* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/08 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Opila Ltd 

Kokary Liberals 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

Kini Drug Empire 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Lave Jet Family 

Alpha Centauri Gold Brotherhood 

Revolutionary Party of Nuenets

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Apoyota Domain 

Morgor Crimson Pirates 

Nang Ta-khian Public Co 

Indaol Independents 

Democrats of Masans 

Values Party of Orishpucho 

Frigaha Purple Pirates 

League of Tutumuye 

Aristocrats of G 239-25 

Ekonir Organisation 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
