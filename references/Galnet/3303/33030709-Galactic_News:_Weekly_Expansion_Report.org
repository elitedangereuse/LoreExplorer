* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/09 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Zeus Bureau 

Labour of Kalads 

Taka Blue Allied Solutions 

Future of Guayambaan 

Autocracy of HIP 13750 

Sekenks Vision Solutions 

Almagest Freedom Party 

Abi Progressive Party 

Volhynians Major Systems 

Loharii Inc 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Crimson State Group 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

Union of Laguvii 

Natural Gluskabiku Focus 

Ju Shakhe Electronics Corporation 

Aristocrats of Lauket 

Dragons of Neche 

Official Ogminiquit Order 

Huichu Inc 

Monarchy of Mam 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
