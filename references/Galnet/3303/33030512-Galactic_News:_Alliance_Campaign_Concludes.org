* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes

/12 May 3303/

A spokesperson for the Alliance has announced that its appeal for construction materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system. 

As the campaign drew to a close, the Alliance released a brief statement: 

“Without the support of the galactic community it would have taken months to amass these materials, but now we are in a position to start work straight away. Those who supported this campaign have our sincerest gratitude.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.
