* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/10 Sep 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Jaques 

HIP 80700 Jet Central PLC 

HIP 47058 Central Corp. 

Dhak Union Party 

Yemaki Dynasty 

Workers of Damontae Republic Party 

Lemana Drug Empire 

Natural Mehit Liberty Party 

Washiri United 

Liberals of Coyotani 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Ngakwites Empire Consulate 

Amahu Labour 

Shongbon Comms Systems 

Yhele Empire Party 

New Rutujil People's Party 

Mikir Comms Corp. 

HIP 14676 Coordinated 

Hez Pef Jet Transport Company 

United HIP 64498 Progressive Party 

Bletii Inc 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
