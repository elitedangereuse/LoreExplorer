* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion

/06 Apr 3303/

The Colonia Council has launched its fifth migration appeal, giving the galaxy's minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula. 

A spokesperson for the council explained the nature of the initiative: 

"Once again we are asking pilots to deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation, in order to earn a migration visa." 

"At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for each organisation's sole use." 

The campaign begins on the 6th of April 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
