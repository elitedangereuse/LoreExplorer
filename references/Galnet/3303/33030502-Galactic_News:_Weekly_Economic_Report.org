* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/02 May 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Uru Federal Interstellar 

Avan Labour Union 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Cemiess Commodities 

Coquim Industry

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Akbakshu United 

League of Ross 1015 

Aleutes Bureau 

League of Orishpucho Movement 

League of 36 Ursae Majoris 

Leaders of Santal 

HIP 86063 Cartel 

Orishpucho Crimson Legal Int 

Papako Crimson Federal and Co 

People's LFT 551 League 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
