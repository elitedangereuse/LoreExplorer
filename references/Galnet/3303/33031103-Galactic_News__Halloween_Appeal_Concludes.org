* Galactic News: Halloween Appeal Concludes

/03 Nov 3303/

A spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver goods to the LHS 2094 system for an opulent Halloween party, and to protect those ferrying commodities to Patterson Vision. 

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 released the following statement: 

“This is going to be one of the greatest Halloween parties of all time! Who cares if the Thargoids kill us all – at least we’ll go out with a bang. And we won’t have to live with the hangover!” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094 system.
