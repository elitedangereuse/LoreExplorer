* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/06 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Ross 754 Labour 

Yakabugai Exchange 

Ruchbah Industry 

Cemiess Commodities 

Kokary Holdings 

Eravate Network 

Zeessze Clan 

Delphin Blue Federal PLC 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

LHS 535 Silver United Ltd 

Orishpucho Jet Hand Gang 

Chau Yu Gold Clan 

BD-13 2439 Comms Systems 

League of 36 Ursae Majoris 

Independent Sopdu Labour 

Taliesin Crimson Fortune Systems 

Democrats of Masans 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
