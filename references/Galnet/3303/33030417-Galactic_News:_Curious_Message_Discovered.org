* Galactic News: Curious Message Discovered

/17 Apr 3303/

A group of EM-transmission technology enthusiasts in the Tionisla system claims to have found a message in the exploration data gathered last year as part of a campaign organised by the Children of Raxxla. 

A spokesperson for the group, which calls itself The Hamsters, said: 

“It was inside one of the beacon modulator wave harmonics, and it seems to be some sort of rhyme. We’ve studied it but have come up with nothing, so we thought we’d share it with the galactic community.” 

The message is reprinted in full below. 

The river to the underworld 

Gaia’s daughter all unfurled 

Fourth minor bear in vain 

By viper’s sting was slain 

Also known as Nemesis 

The doom of Chimera 

She is tasked with soothing pain 

Suckling Odysseus from afar 

Mother of the mother of 

Leader of the Titans 

He transformed into a hawk 

A daughter of Daedalion’s 

The piercer was how he was known 

Mother of Ulysses 

Ruler of the winds 

God of night, primordial flees 

Zeus’ namesake now lies in Sol 

Achilles’ favoured horse 

Women of vengeance infernal 

The vain queen rides not forth 

A final word, a course to follow, a poor miser’s sum
