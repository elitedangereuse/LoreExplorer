/04 Aug 3303/

A spokesperson for the Harma Silver Cartel has announced that its appeal for rare alcohols has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering rare alcohols and eliminating agitators so traders could reach Gabriel Enterprise safely. 

The campaign’s success has already had a positive impact on Harma, as evidenced by the hundreds of pilots celebrating in bars throughout the system. 

As the initiative drew to a close, the Cartel released a brief statement: 

“To the galaxy’s independent pilots, we say this: the finest rum is waiting for you in Harma.” 

Pilots who supported the campaign can now collect their rewards from Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system.
