* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/30 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Chicoana Silver Travel Corp. 

Avalon Emperor's Grace 

Workers of Ahaykenkan Confederacy 

League of Benapem Law Party 

New Rutujil People's Party 

Revolutionary Eluskapu Partnership 

Mbayame Domain 

Democrats of HIP 57080 

Raiders of 97 i Tauri 

Awa One 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Co-operative of Yiman 

Democrats of BD-02 4304 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

CD-37 641 Empire Pact 

Anduliga Empire Group 

Leaders of Long 

Velnians Gold Transport Holdings 

HIP 73314 Crimson Allied and Co 

Natural 97 i Tauri Dominion 

Picus Jet State Company 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
