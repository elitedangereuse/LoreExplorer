* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/04 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

HIP 73428 Exchange 

HIP 8593 Empire League 

Ross 754 Labour 

Nahua Citizens' Forum 

G 99-49 Life Industry 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

HIP 115314 Jet Crew 

HIP 113454 Crew 

HIP 65921 Silver Bridge Systems 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Eranin Peoples Party 

Independents of Mildeptu 

39 Tauri Interstellar 

Labour of Geras 

Zugen Incorporated 

Durius Dominion 

Inupiates Patrons of Law 

Zeus Bureau 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Xuanduna Imperial Society 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
