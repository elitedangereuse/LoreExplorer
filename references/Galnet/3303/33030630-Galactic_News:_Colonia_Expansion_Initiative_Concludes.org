* Galactic News: Colonia Expansion Initiative Concludes

/30 Jun 3303/

A spokesperson for the Junkyard Dogs has announced that its appeal for construction materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Tolagarf's Junkyard, the organisationâ€™s base of operations. The materials will be used to construct new outposts in the Colonia region. 

The Junkyard Dogs have extended their gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Tolagarf's Junkyard in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 system.
