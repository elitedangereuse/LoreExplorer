* Community Goal: Wolves of Jonai Appeal

/10 Nov 3303/

The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced plans to expand its presence in HR 7047 by constructing a new asteroid base among the rings of HR 7047 2 C. But with a lack of reliable supply lines into the system, the Wolves are relying on the galactic community for help in amassing the necessary materials. 

The Jonai Merchant's Guild has been authorised to oversee the appeal, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver titanium, beryllium, explosives, aluminium and palladium to Grant Dock in the HR 7047 system. The Wolves of Jonai have also placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 9th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
