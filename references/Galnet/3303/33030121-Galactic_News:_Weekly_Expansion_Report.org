* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/21 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

The Pilots Federation 

39 Tauri Interstellar 

Liberals of Delta Pavonis 

Co-operative of Yiman 

Kuwemargl Patrons of Law 

Heike Co 

Kapurri Emperor's Grace 

Kondriates Prison Colony 

LHS 199 Guardians of Tradition 

Jaques 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Labour of Ethgreze 

Kokary Liberals 

Eranin Peoples Party 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

LHS 3598 Transport Group 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Dominion of Skadjalini 

HIP 113632 Empire Consulate 

Aisoci Empire League 

Briganu Confederacy 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
