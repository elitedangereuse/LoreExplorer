/27 Jun 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Nang Ta-khian Public Co	 

Lambda Hydri Jet Clan 

League of 36 Ursae Majoris 

Caraswang Gold Public Inc 

Democrats of Masans 

Leaders of Santal 

Values Party of Orishpucho 

Orishpucho Crimson Legal Int 

Neginn Crimson Travel Network

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
