* Galactic News: Rogue Runners Appeal Concludes

/08 Dec 3303/

The Rogue Runners have announced that their campaign to renovate an asteroid base in Run has received the unalloyed support of the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Smithport, the organisation’s base of operations. The initiative was supported by scores of independent combat pilots, who protected those delivering goods to the starport. 

Autumn Leif, the founder of Rogue Runners Co., released the following statement as the campaign drew to a close: 

"I would like to thank the galactic community for supporting this initiative. We now have everything we need to repair and upgrade Leif Enterprise, which should soon be offering a large selection of ships and modules. This would not have been possible without the help of Rogue Security and the galaxy’s independent combat pilots, who provided outstanding protection.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Smithport in the Run system.
