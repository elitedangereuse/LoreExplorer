* Community Goal: Knights of Karma Appeal

/09 Jun 3303/

Over the past year, the Qa’wakana system has become a focal point for the Knights of Karma, a rapidly expanding organisation that has attracted support from across the galaxy. Now the group has announced plans to establish a new mining facility among the rings of Qa’wakana 6. 

A spokesman for the organisation released a statement regarding the proposal. 

“Plans for the facility are underway, but we will need the support of the galactic community if the project is to succeed. We are therefore offering generous remuneration to pilots who deliver construction materials to Carpini Terminal in the Qa’wakana system.” 

The spokesperson added that the organisation had placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list. 

“The construction of this new facility is sure to aggravate those who want to preserve the status quo, and we are expecting resistance. So we’re asking combat pilots to help us protect innocent traders from persecution.” 

The campaign begins on the 8th of June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
