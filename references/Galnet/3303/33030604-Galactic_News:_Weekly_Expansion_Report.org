* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/04 Jun 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Nun Major Industry 

Movement for Tobarci Confederacy 

Imset Patron's Principles 

New Rutujil People's Party 

Gunwithhogg Travel Industries 

HR 8250 Camorra 

Param Co-operative 

Maribone Silver Electronics Co 

Kwatyriel and Co 

Othi Silver Legal Corp. 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Wolf 217 Left Party 

Anduliga Empire Group 

Njangamarda Empire Party 

Brotherhood of Caerete 

Begovans Industry 

Liu Di Imperial Society 

Atlantis Empire League 

BD+14 2955 Republic Party 

Tatapai Empire Assembly 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
