* Galactic News: Engineers Reduce Requirements

/11 Jan 3303/

The galaxy's independent engineers have announced a joint accord designed to make enhancements for civilian spacecraft more affordable. A spokesperson confirmed the accord was intended to ensure the safety of independent pilots traversing the space lanes. 

As a consequence, independent engineers will no longer require commodities in order to upgrade modules and weapons â€“ only materials will be needed. 

Meanwhile, in a fortunate turn of events, analysts have reported that the market value of a number of commodities has risen. Consequently, pilots seeking to offload commodities can do so profitably.
