* Community Goal: Feeding California

/10 Nov 3303/

The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has announced plans to establish an agricultural facility in the Synuefai LX-R d5-28 system, with the aim of supporting the Alliance and Turner Research Group outposts in the California Nebula. 

To support this goal, the organisation has asked the galactic community to deliver terrain enrichment systems, crop harvesters and auto fabricators to Hansford’s Landing in the BD+22 4939 system. Commanders who support the campaign will be generously compensated. 

Saool Aledon, a senior operative in the Spinward Marches, released the following statement: 

“We are well aware of the challenges involved in supporting outposts far from the core systems. We want to leverage our expertise to support the Alliance’s operations in the California Nebula, and we hope we have the support of the galactic community.” 

The campaign begins on the 9th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
