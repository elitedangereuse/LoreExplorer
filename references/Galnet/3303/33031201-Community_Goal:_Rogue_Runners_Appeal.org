* Community Goal: Rogue Runners Appeal

/01 Dec 3303/

The Rogue Runners, an independent group based in the Run system, have announced plans to restore and expand Leif Enterprise, an asteroid base in their home system. The organisation has expressed hope that the renovated base will become a manufacturing centre for high-end ships and modules. 

Autumn Leif, the founder of Rogue Runners Co., released the following statement: 

“We have always worked hard to ensure that our customers have the goods they need. With demand for both ships and components rising, we need this base to be fully functional. We hope that by reinforcing the superstructure with meta-alloys, we can make the base resistant to the harmful effects of Thargoid Sensors.” 

In support of this goal, the organisation has placed an open order for Meta-Alloys, Platinum and Building Fabricators, promising to reward contractors who deliver these goods to Smithport in the Run system. The Rogue Runners have also placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list, to ensure that those delivering goods to Smithport can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 30th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
