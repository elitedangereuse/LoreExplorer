The Vestani Conservatives have announced that their Valentine's Day appeal received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community, with hundreds of pilots taking to their ships to transport commodities to Rose Terminal in the Vestani system. 

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement: 

"We are delighted with the response, and would like to thank the galactic community for helping us make this Valentine's Day particularly special." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Rose Terminal in the Vestani system.
