* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/06 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

i Bootis Democrats 

LTT 2622 Crimson Power Solutions 

BD-13 2439 Comms Systems 

HIP 5700 Electronics Co 

The Guild 

United Pliny Labour 

League of 36 Ursae Majoris 

Workers of MCC 445 Green Party 

Union of Kappa Phoenicis Labour 

Wolf 393 Netcoms Commodities 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
