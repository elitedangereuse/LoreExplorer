* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/22 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Order of Ethgreze 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Laedla and Co 

Liberty Party of Zeessze 

Green Party of HIP 103138 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

GCRV 4654 State Interstellar 

Zelano Systems 

Opila Ltd 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Kini Drug Empire 

LHS 3479 Interstellar 

WISE 0855-0714 Gold Gang 

Nationalists of Aulin 

BD-13 2439 Comms Systems 

Workers of Lalande 29917 Green Party 

Indines Commodities 

Lambda Hydri Industry 

Independents of 22 g Leonis 

Brothers of Abroin 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
