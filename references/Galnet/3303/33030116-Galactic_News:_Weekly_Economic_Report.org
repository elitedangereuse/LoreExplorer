* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/16 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Uru Federal Interstellar 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Coalition of Ngaliba 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Cemiess Commodities 

Orrere Ring 

Eravate Network 

Eravate Life Services 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel 

Iapodes Purple Dynamic Holdings 

NLTT 6667 Republic Party 

Green Party of CD-54 4840 

Surya PLC 

Crimson Transport Ltd 

Future of Udegoci 

Carpaka Central Industry 

HIP 1419 Empire Consulate 

Union of Kappa Phoenicis Labour 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
