* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/20 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Partnership of Chankates 

HIP 80700 Jet Central PLC 

Democrats of HIP 57080 

G 139-50 Electronics Partners 

HIP 9473 Industries 

Progressive Party of Uracenufon 

Clayagro Interstellar 

LHS 3631 Network 

Friends of Fugeniez 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Order of Ethgreze 

Crimson State Group 

HIP 9610 Jet Legal Systems 

Gitxsan Limited 

Kuwemargl Patrons of Law 

Brotherhood of Caerete 

Begovans Industry  

Coalition of Bodedi 

HIP 113454 Crew 

Gyvata Indi Purple Syndicate 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
