* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/13 Jun 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Social Zaragas Independents 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

LTT 377 Purple General Corp. 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Kokary Holdings 

Cemiess Commodities 

Eravate Network 

Laedla and Co 

Panoi Holdings

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Alpha Centauri Gold Brotherhood 

Movement for 11 Cephei Worker's Party 

Orishpucho Jet Hand Gang 

Aleutes Bureau 

Sif League 

G 239-25 Alliance 

Alliance of Dharm 

Eurybia Empire Consulate 

League of Pentun 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
