* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/25 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Uru Federal Interstellar 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Cemiess Commodities 

Coquim Industry 

Orrere Ring 

Eravate Network 

Eravate Life Services 

Delphin Blue Federal PLC 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Morgor Crimson Pirates 

Sif League 

HIP 5700 Empire League 

Democrats of Masans 

Taliesin Crimson Fortune Systems 

Indines Commodities 

Bakara Empire Party 

LTT 9455 Labour 

WISE 0855-0714 United Exchange 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
