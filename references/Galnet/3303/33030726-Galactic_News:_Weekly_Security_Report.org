* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report

/26 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown: 

Ngadjal Citizens' Forum 

Wolf 718 Comms Solutions 

Paesing Purple Public Inc 

Movement for Kartenes Democrats 

Hand Gang of LTT 13866 

64 Arietis Jet General Solutions 

New Bomazi Front 

Traditional HIP 19157 Focus

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system’s wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period. 

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest: 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

Revolutionary Party of Nuenets 

Dragons of HIP 1914 

Findja Empire Assembly 

Nationalists of Aulin 

Independents of LHS 3262 

Crimson Major Incorporated 

Progressive Party of LP 542-33 

Leaders of Aunochis 

Hand Gang of LTT 13866 

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system’s wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.
