* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/25 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

39 Tauri Interstellar 

LHS 1110 Patron's Principles 

Njundji Alliance 

Leschanatya Future 

Coalition of Bodedi 

League of Ch'i Lin Freedom Party 

Tatapai Empire Assembly 

Duduseklis Empire League 

Cordenet Group 

Egovi Dominion 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Labour of Ethgreze 

LP 811-17 Gold Energy Partners 

Kuwemargl Patrons of Law 

Thiin Gold Netcoms Interstellar 

Baraswar Crimson Vision Ltd 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

United Nang Ta-khian Confederacy 

NLTT 8653 Empire Consulate 

Serrot Blue General Group 

Gilyadar Services 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
