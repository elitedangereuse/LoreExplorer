* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/27 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Uru Federal Interstellar  

Avan Labour Union  

Union of Wolf 359 Labour  

Ngaliba Blue Camorra  

Cemiess Commodities  

Eravate Network  

Brani Federal Holdings  

Yakabugai Exchange 

Panoi Holdings 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Coalition of Ngaliba  

Potriti Gold Mafia  

Autocracy of Phi Gruis  

Nang Ta-khian Public Co  

Huaich Independents  

Eshu Gold Mafia  

Ruchbah Progressive Party  

Traditional Kakmbutan Justice Party  

G 239-25 Alliance 

LFT 880 Vision Company 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
