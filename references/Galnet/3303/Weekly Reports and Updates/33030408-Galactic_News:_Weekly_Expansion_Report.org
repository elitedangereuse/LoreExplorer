* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/08 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Parhul Silver Electronics Hldgs  

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State  

Betel Free 

League of Ross 1015  

Defence Force of LHS 1122  

Gliese 9106 Partners 

Zhu Vedani Blue Transport Dev  

New Rutujil People's Party  

Haeduwong Systems  

NLTT 8084 Natural Services 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Eranin Peoples Party 

Zugen Incorporated 

Bodb Dearg Order  

Confederation of Dahan  

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network  

Cegreeth Citizens' Forum  

Bureau of Tetrian Liberty Party 

Jaques  

Eta Horologii Gold Vision PLC  

HIP 117865 Empire Pact 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
