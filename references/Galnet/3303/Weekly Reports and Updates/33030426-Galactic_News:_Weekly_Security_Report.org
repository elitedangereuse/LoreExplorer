/26 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system’s wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system’s wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.
