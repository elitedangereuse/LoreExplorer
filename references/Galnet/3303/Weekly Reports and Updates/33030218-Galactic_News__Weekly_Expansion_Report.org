* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/18 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Annarr Dynamic Corp. 

Kikians Purple Vision PLC 

Betel Free 

Jaques 

Tian Xian Inc 

Labour of Kalads 

Movement for Oduwaid Fo Labour 

Martio Imperial Society 

Djinaura Brotherhood 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Kokary Liberals 

GCRV 4654 State Interstellar 

Labour of Ethgreze 

Revolutionary Heheng Future 

39 Tauri Interstellar 

Labour of Geras 

Inupiates Patrons of Law 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

HIP 113100 Imperial Society 

LHS 3598 Transport Group 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
