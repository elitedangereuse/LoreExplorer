* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report

/14 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Chamunda Crimson Gang
