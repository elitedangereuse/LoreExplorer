* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/07 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Fawaol Patrons of Law 

Durius Dominion 

Allied Herthans Front 

Betel Free 

Lao Gobe Coalition 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Jaques 

Labour of Kalads 

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats 

Styra Empire League 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Ross 754 Labour 

Labour of Ethgreze 

Revolutionary Heheng Future 

Labour of Geras 

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party 

Ciguru Republic Party 

LHS 3384 Progressive Party 

Emperor's Will 

Codorain Network 

Nahuatl Guardians of Tradition 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
