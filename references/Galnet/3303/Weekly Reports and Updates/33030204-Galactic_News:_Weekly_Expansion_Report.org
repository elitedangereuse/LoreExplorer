* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/04 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Natural LP 811-17 Conservatives 

Idomatyritu Travel Industries 

Betel Free 

Co-operative of Brangkalar 

Caelinus Blue Life Co 

Almas Corporation 

Zhou Wang Citizens' Forum 

Xhosag Imperial Society

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Revolutionary Heheng Future 

Labour of Geras 

Zugen Incorporated 

Gitxsan Limited 

Union of Delta Phoenicis Revolutionary Party 

Fawaol Patrons of Law 

Durius Dominion 

Heike Co 

LTT 15278 Commodities 

Lao Zi Blue Fortune Corp. 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
