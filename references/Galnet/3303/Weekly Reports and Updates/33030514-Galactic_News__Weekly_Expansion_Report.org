* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/14 May 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Partnership of Nitikaba 

Atung Mussa Purple Comms Ind 

Yimanbin Nationalists 

Osuntes Interstellar 

Cakutsi Movement 

Koing Dynasty 

Democrats of HIP 57080 

Union of Aiaba Partnership 

Awa One 

Alliance of Gunwini 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Movement for Pienate Labour 

HIP 17984 Gold Brotherhood  

Kikua Empire Party 

Coalition of Djagana 

Unified Tagarilocan 

Kumbia Ltd 

Wakam Central Commodities 

Orisala Co-operative 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
