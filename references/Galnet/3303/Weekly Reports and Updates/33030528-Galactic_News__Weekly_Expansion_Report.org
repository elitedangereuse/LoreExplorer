* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/28 May 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Parhul Silver Electronics Hldgs 

Movement for Tobarci Confederacy 

G 167-35 Corp. 

Integrated HIP 1055 

LP 644-15 Gang 

Wakam Central Commodities

HIP 99271 Regulatory State 

HIP 47058 Central Corp.

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Pirates of Bean 

Annarr Dynamic Corp. 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Brotherhood of Caerete 

Workers of Ahaykenkan Confederacy 

Paletes Interstellar 

Paesui Xena Empire Group 

Posse of HIP 97337 

Independents of HIP 22006 

LTT 537 Nationalists 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
