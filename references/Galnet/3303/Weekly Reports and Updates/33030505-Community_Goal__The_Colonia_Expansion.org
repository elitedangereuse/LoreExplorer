* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion

/05 May 3303/

The sixth Colonia migration appeal has now begun, giving the galaxy’s minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula. 

A spokesperson for the council reminded the public of the migration process: 

“Pilots who to want to earn a migration visa for their chosen organisation should deliver the requested commodity to Jaques Station.” 

“At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for each organisation’s use.” 

The campaign begins on the 4th of May 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
