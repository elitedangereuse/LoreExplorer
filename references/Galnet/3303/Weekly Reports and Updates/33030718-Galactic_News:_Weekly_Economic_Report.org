* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/18 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Order of Ethgreze

Laedla and Co 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Coquim Industry 

Zelano Systems 

Opila Ltd

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Quator Ring 

Indaol Blue Major Corporation 

Libanatya Gold Netcoms Comms 

Chukchu Allied Network 

LHS 3080 Coalition 

Volcae Independents 

United Kini Coalitio 

WISE 0855-0714 United Exchange 

Workers of Lalande 29917 Green Party 

Official Eravate Flag 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
