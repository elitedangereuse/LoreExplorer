* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/30 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Liberty Party of Zeessze 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

GCRV 4654 State Interstellar 

Opila Ltd 

Crimson State Group

Allied FK5 2550 Autocracy 

Ololos Drug Empire

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

WISE 0855-0714 Gold Gang 

Apoyota Domain 

Quator Ring 

Nationalists of Aulin 

Leaders of Santal 

Aditi Crimson Energy Inc 

LTT 18486 Pirates 

Partnership of Alpha Centauri 

The Order of Justice 

Wat Yu Resistance 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
