* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/16 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Parhul Silver Electronics Hldgs 

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Jaques 

Future of LTT 911 

League of Ross 1015 

Wonorne Nu Natural Limited 

Imset Patron's Principles

NLTT 8084 Natural Services 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Crimson State Group 

Eranin Peoples Party 

Labour of Geras 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Ciguru Republic Party 

Regulatory State of Kausan 

Jurokkju Imperial Society 

Partnership of Triviatii 

Zhou Wang Citizens' Forum 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
