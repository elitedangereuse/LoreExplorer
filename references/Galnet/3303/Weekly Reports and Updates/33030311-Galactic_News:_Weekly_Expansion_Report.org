* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/11 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 73428 Exchange  

HIP 9610 Jet Legal Systems  

Wolf 217 Left Party  

Official Palengue Liberty Party  

Matia Empire League  

Jaques  

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats  

HIP 65921 Silver Bridge Systems  

Noblemen of Vanayeb Hua 

Egovi Dominion 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Zugen Incorporated  

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party  

LHS 3505 Crimson Mafia  

Zeus Bureau  

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire  

HIP 28987 Empire Pact  

Annarr Dynamic Corp. 

Firdaus Transport Company  

LTT 700 Jet Major Holdings 

LHS 3516 Fortune Company 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
