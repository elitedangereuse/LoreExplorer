* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/03 Sep 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 10570 Constitution Party 

Chick Ek Partnership 

Cerno Independents 

Mbayame Domain 

Toxanda Public Organisation 

Picus Jet State Company 

Khants Systems 

LTT 970 Holdings 

Conservatives of Grebatabea 

Yaringu Blue Dynamic Industry 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Crimson State Group 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

V886 Centauri Future 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Bureau of Tetrian Liberty Party 

Almas Corporation 

Defence Party of NLTT 57668 

Paletes Interstellar 

Arapathaka Empire Party 

LP 350-75 Fortune Company 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
