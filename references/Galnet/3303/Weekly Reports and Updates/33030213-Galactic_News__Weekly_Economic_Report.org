* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/13 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Social Zaragas Independents 

Brani Federal Holdings 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

Yakabugai Exchange 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Kokary Holdings 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Panoi Holdings 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

i Bootis Central Limited 

LHS 535 Silver United Ltd 

HIP 6758 Posse 

LTT 2622 Crimson Power Solutions 

Orishpucho Jet Hand Gang 

Nagii Union 

HIP 5700 Electronics Co 

Robigo Cartel 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
