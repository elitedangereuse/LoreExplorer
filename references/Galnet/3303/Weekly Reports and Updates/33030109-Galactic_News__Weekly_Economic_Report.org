* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/09 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Social Zaragas Independents 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Order of Ethgreze 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Kokary Holdings 

Ruchbah Industry 

Zeessze Clan 

Eravate Network 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Zugen Incorporated 

i Bootis Central Limited 

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel 

Flesk Transport Organisation 

League of Ross 1015 

Purple Central and Co 

Green Party of CD-54 4840 

Comanga Crimson Crew 

Movement for Anu Free 

Bento Labour 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
