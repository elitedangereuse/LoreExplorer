* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/30 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Uru Federal Interstellar 

Avan Labour Union 

Coalition of Ngaliba 

Cemiess Commodities 

Eravate Network 

Eravate Life Services 

Vanayequi Independents 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Confederation of Dahan 

Defence Force of Baga 

LTT 2622 Crimson Power Solutions 

BD-13 2439 Comms Systems 

Copian Xing Labour 

Kokondji Jet Boys 

Independent Sopdu Labour 

LTT 1582 Exchange 

Workers of MCC 445 Green Party 

Kung Mu Progressive Party 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
