* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion

/09 Mar 3303/

The Colonia Council has launched a fourth migration appeal, giving the galaxy's minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula. 

A spokesperson for the organisation explained the nature of the initiative: 

"Once again we are asking pilots to deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation in order to earn a migration visa." 

"At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation's sole use." 

The campaign begins on the 9th of March 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
