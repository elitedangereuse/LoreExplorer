* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report

/31 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown: 

Orrere Ring 

HIP 22006 Purple Cartel 

Chaimal Jet Public Services 

Gendini Incorporated 

Baedi Di Rats 

Barons of Mundine 

Hiralarsh First 

Kagudi Allied Interstellar

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system’s wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period. 

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest: 

Independents of LHS 3262 

Alliance of HIP 13269 

Crimson Major Incorporated 

Labour of 64 Arietis 

Social Holler Green Party 

Saontiana and Co 

Integrated HIP 111657 

Values Party of Shenggan 

HR 3007 Coordinated 

LP 726-6 Partners 

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system’s wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.
