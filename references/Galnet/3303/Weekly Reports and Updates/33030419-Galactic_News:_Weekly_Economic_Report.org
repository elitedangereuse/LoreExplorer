* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/19 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Social Zaragas Independents 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

Order of Ethgreze 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Ruchbah Industry 

Zeessze Clan 

Cemiess Commodities 

Eravate Network

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Morgor Crimson Pirates 

Keries Camorra 

Orishpucho Jet Hand Gang 

Aleutes Bureau 

HIP 5700 Empire League 

Friends of Varramool 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
