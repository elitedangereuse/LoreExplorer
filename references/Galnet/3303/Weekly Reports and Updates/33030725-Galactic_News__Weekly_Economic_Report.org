* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/25 Jul 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Order of Ethgreze 

Laedla and Co 

Liberty Party of Zeessze 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Coquim Industry 

Zelano Systems 

Opila Ltd 

Junga Interstellar

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Apoyota Domain 

Aulin Republic Party 

United Nang Ta-khian Confederacy 

Sif League 

G 239-25 Alliance 

Caraswang Gold Public Inc 

Democrats of Masans 

Indaol Blue Major Corporation 

Values Party of Orishpucho 

Partnership of HIP 67086 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
