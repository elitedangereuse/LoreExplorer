* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report

/06 Sep 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown: 

Orrere Ring 

Bureau of Tetrian Liberty Party

HIP 22006 Purple Cartel 

Neperimpox Brotherhood 

HIP 15062 Crimson Pirates 

Baedi Di Rats

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system’s wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period. 

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest: 

United Wat Yu Confederacy 

Quince Creative Holdings 

Gold Netcoms Limited 

Calennero Crew 

HR 3635 Universal and Co 

Dinkas Purple Posse 

LP 726-6 Partners 

Wolf 440 Federal PLC

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system’s wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.
