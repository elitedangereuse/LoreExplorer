* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/20 Mar 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Social Zaragas Independents 

Brani Federal Holdings 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Ruchbah Industry 

Kokary Holdings 

Eravate Network 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Zeessze Clan 

Delphin Blue Federal PLC 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Coalition of Ngaliba 

Autocracy of Phi Gruis  

Partnership of LHS 2819 

League of Ross 1015 

Atroan Gold Gang 

Huaich Independents 

Liberate Ceos 

G 239-25 Alliance 

People's Perendi Future 

Wirangu Life Co 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
