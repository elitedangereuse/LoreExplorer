* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/01 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Sol Workers' Party 

Modgud Commodities 

Bodb Dearg Order 

Njundji Alliance 

Leschanatya Future 

Future of LTT 911 

Workers of Ahaykenkan Confederacy 

United Bese Party 

Defence Force of HR 8793 

HIP 1885 Patron's Principles 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Coquim Industry 

Crimson State Group 

Zugen Incorporated 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

LHS 3598 Transport Group 

Confederation of Dahan 

Idomatyritu Travel Industries 

Allied Herthans Front 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

HIP 113632 Empire Consulate 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
