* Galactic News: Starport Status Update

/24 Jan 3303/

The recent Sirius Corporation campaign to protect starports from Unknown Artefact-related interference is already bearing fruit. 

Using material donated by the galactic community, Sirius Corporation scientists have dramatically increased the efficiency of meta-alloy application, thereby restoring many of the starports affected by Unknown Artefact-related disruption. 

The corporation's researchers have confirmed that far fewer meta-alloys are now needed to counter Unknown Artefact-related disruption and repair malfunctioning starports. 

As the lists below indicate, the number of affected starports has already been reduced, and it is hoped that these lists will only shorten as the weeks go on. 

At the time of writing, the following starports remain closed. 

Birkhoff Station, Chnemine 

Descartes Station, Neche
