* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/11 Feb 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Branglal PLC 

LHS 3516 Fortune Company 

Idomatyritu Travel Industries 

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State 

Brotherhood of Caerete 

Jaques 

HIP 5712 Guardians of Tradition 

Friends of Kotigen 

Defence Party of NLTT 57668 

League of Ross 1015 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Coquim Industry 

Zugen Incorporated 

Durius Dominion 

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

Regulatory State of Kausan 

Lao Zi Blue Fortune Corp. 

Imenhit Limited 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
