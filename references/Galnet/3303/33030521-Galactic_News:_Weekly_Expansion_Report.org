* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/21 May 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 73428 Exchange 

Njikan Jet Dynamic Industry  

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Jaques 

Labour of Kalads 

Yimanbin Nationalists 

Friends of Pirigen 

Brotherhood of Hasattra 

Karex Mob 

HIP 20577 Blue Dragons 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Partnership of LHS 2819 

Co-operative of Brangkalar 

Anotchi Citizens' Forum 

Nationals of Algreit 

Future of LTT 911  

Posse of HIP 97337 

Monarchy of Michael Pantazis 

New Rutujil People's Party 

Haeduwong Systems 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
