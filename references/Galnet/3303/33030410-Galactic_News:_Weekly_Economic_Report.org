* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/10 Apr 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Limapa Blue State Commodities  

Uru Federal Interstellar  

Union of Wolf 359 Labour  

Cemiess Commodities  

Coquim Industry 

Eravate Network  

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

AG+21 1754 Citizen Party  

HIP 8593 Empire League 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Morgor Crimson Pirates  

Keries Camorra  

Aleutes Bureau  

League of 36 Ursae Majoris 

Mehnemine Free 

Jodrell Creative Exchange 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
