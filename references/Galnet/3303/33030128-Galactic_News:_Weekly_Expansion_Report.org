* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/28 Jan 3303/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Branglal PLC 

Natural LP 811-17 Conservatives 

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire 

HIP 114530 Guardians 

Mutujiali Empire Consulate 

Jaques 

New Belenja Defence Party 

HIP 65921 Silver Bridge Systems 

Paesui Xena Empire Group 

Cheneti Guardians of Tradition 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

The Pilots Federation 

Zugen Incorporated 

Heike Co 

Firdaus Transport Company 

Mictlan Empire Assembly 

HIP 114044 Empire Group 

Karsha Empire Consulate 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Xuanduna Imperial Society 

Betel Free 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
