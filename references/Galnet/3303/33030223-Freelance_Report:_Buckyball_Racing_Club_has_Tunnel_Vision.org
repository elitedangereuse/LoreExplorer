* Freelance Report: Buckyball Racing Club has Tunnel Vision

/23 Feb 3303/

After a relatively quiet start to the year, the Buckyball Racing Club is back with its first full-length race of 3303: Tunnel Vision. 

The race, which is between Leopold Heckmann Ring in the Malaikudi system and Evans Port in Parutis, requires competitors to navigate a series of tunnels at various scientific and military installations en route. Bonuses will be awarded depending on ship size, meaning some very large ships will be squeezed through some very tight spaces. 

The Buckyball Racing Club refused to address rumours that the race will use Federal and Imperial capital ship docks as gates. 

The event starts on Saturday the 25th of February and will run until Monday the 6th of March.
