* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/15 Aug 3303/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy’s minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Order of Ethgreze 

Green Party of HIP 103138 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

GCRV 4654 State Interstellar 

Coquim Industry 

Opila Ltd 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

Kini Drug Empire 

Brani Federal Holdings 

AG+21 1754 Citizen Party 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

LHS 3479 Interstellar 

Morgor Crimson Pirates 

BD-13 2439 Comms Systems 

LHS 2884 Dominion 

Lambda Hydri Industry 

People's LFT 551 League 

LHS 3006 Blue Brotherhood 

Partnership of Alpha Centauri 

Earls of Dahan 

The Order of Justice 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
