* Tionisla Hosts Theatre and Dance Gala

/24 Aug 3305/

The Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its fifth week, focusing on a wide variety of theatre and dance performances. 

Crowds have flocked to New Caledonia in the Tionisla system to enjoy performance art from dozens of systems. Shows ranging from elaborate stage productions to amateur street recitals have offered classical operas, circus shows, theatrical plays and much more. 

Art critic Bryony Lindholm published this review on Vox Galactica: 

“While the entertainment on display has been nothing short of marvellous, a personal favourite has been the ballet ‘Bones of Dreams’. It is performed by skeletal robot dancers made of scrap salvaged from the Tionisla orbital graveyard.” 

“It is a moving portrayal of inhumanity, and like most of the audience, I was left in tears despite – or perhaps because of – the absence of any sentient organisms depicting grand themes of grief and loss.” 

The Alliance Festival of Culture continues next week in Alioth and will feature a presentation at the Garden City Gallery.
