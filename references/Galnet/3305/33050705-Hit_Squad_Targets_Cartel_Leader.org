* Hit Squad Targets Cartel Leader

/05 Jul 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency headquarters in Olympus Village has been infiltrated by a mercenary unit attempting to murder Jan Sandoval, one of the Red Family cartel’s founders. 

Executive Agent Viola Trask gave an account to the press: 

“This was an extraordinary breach of the FIA’s most secure location. The mercenaries were highly trained professionals carrying false identification to bypass initial checks.“ 

“It’s clear that they were targeting Sandoval, who is currently in protective custody at FIA headquarters. Fortunately, our security systems exposed the intruders before they could reach her, and the threat was swiftly neutralised.” 

“This assassination attempt reinforces our belief that the information Sandoval offers is not only genuine but also a legitimate threat to the Red Family’s existence. Interviews with Sandoval are ongoing, and we are reviewing her testimony in detail.”
