* Second Fatality in Rackham Conflict

/29 Mar 3305/

The head of personnel at Rackham Capital Investments has died in an accident, becoming the second senior-level employee to have died in recent weeks. 

Journalist Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times: 

“Senior executive Derrin O’Shea was killed when his personal limousine malfunctioned and crashed. The incident has not been ruled as suspicious. O’Shea’s position was filled within hours by a supporter of Taja Gavaris, however. Gavaris herself inherited the CFO role in a similar fashion following her predecessor’s recent death.” 

“With two close allies gone, CEO Zachary Rackham must feel under threat. This corporate power struggle increasingly resembles two pirate captains fighting to become overall leader.” 

“The authorities have again declined to begin a formal investigations into Gavaris and Rackham, claiming a lack of evidence. How many more casualties must occur before this conflict is taken seriously?”
