* Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force Appeal Ends

/20 Jun 3305/

An appeal for materials from Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force has concluded successfully. 

Following coordinated efforts by the galactic community, a large number of deliveries were completed to Chu City in Shana Bei. The new megaship, EFS Archangel, has now been completed and is currently undergoing final quality checks from the technicians involved. 

The group’s commander, Archangel Evangeline, provided the following statement: 

“Our command group is preparing the EFS Archangel for her shakedown cruise through the system. On behalf of Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force, we salute the galactic community for its support and generous efforts. Without their assistance, this would not have been possible.” 

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Chu City in the Shana Bei system.
