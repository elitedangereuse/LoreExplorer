/01 Sep 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

An exhibition of the visual arts has been upstaged by notorious art thief the Winking Cat during the Alliance Festival of Culture’s sixth week. The stolen artwork ‘Penance Street’ by Megan Madigan was discovered in an empty room of the Garden City Gallery in Alioth. Gallery staff soon found the infamous winking cat motif hidden behind the picture. 

The Starship Enterprises faction has confirmed the success of its initiative to establish an asteroid base in the LP 339-7 system. The corporation has expressed hope that an increase in trade and industry will benefit the whole system. 

Finally, the Sap Core Legion faction has called for independent pilots to deliver resources for the construction of a medical facility in the Heike system. The organisers hope that the new orbital facility will benefit the region. 

And those are the main stories this week.
