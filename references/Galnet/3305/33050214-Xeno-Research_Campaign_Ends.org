* Xeno-Research Campaign Ends

/14 Feb 3305/

A campaign from the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully.  

Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir told the media: 

“Thanks to Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int we now have sufficient materials to build a planetary outpost where our scientists can study lifeforms identified by the galactic community.” 

“We are also grateful for the exploration data provided by many pilots, which will help us create a new research catalogue.” 

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system.
