* Sap Core Legion Initiative Concludes

/05 Sep 3305/

A commodity drive hosted by the Sap Core Legion faction has ended successfully, resulting in the construction of a medical facility in the Heike system. 

With independent pilots having provided commodities in large numbers, Swords Rest Medical Facility has now entered operation around Heike 1. 

Professor Macklin Fox offered these words of thanks to contributors: 

“I am pleased by the response to this initiative and appreciate the efforts of all involved. Access to off-world medical facilities is not just an Allied issue - it is an issue for the galaxy.” 

Commanders who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Braun Enterprise in the Heike system.
