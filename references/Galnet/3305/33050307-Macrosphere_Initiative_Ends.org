/07 Mar 3305/

A components drive for a device to detect illegally reprogrammed robots has concluded successfully. 

Taniyah Sharpe, CEO of technology company Macrosphere, announced: 

“There was a fantastic response to our request, which the DS Leonis Industries organised on our behalf. Many thanks to those who participated.” 

“Whether you own a personal admin robot or a factory of industrial machines, the Mech Scanner will confirm that they are functioning as intended.” 

Pilots who took part in the initiative can now collect their rewards from Grandin Terminal in the DS Leonis system.
