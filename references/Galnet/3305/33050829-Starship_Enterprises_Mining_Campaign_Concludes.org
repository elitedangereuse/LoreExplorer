* Starship Enterprises Mining Campaign Concludes

/29 Aug 3305/

A mining initiative by the Starship Enterprises faction has ended successfully, with the establishment of a new asteroid base in the LP 339-7 system. 

Independent miners delivered large quantities of construction materials, which were used to complete construction of the new installation. The starport Miner Prospects has now opened for business in the planetary ring of LP 339-7 4. 

Company CEO Dr Lewis Chapman held a press conference to thank those involved: 

“The new base will offer much-needed resources to the system’s outer reaches, and act as the headquarters for our SE Mining division. I never doubted the galactic community’s response, and it is a humbling thing to see in action.” 

Commanders who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Gell-Mann Ring in the LP 339-7 system.
