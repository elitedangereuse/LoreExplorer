The Children of Tothos cult has taken control of Archambault terminal in the Chun Tstar system. Access to most station services has been suspended. It is feared that the cult’s leader, Barnabas Cole, plans to detonate the Lucifer Device as part of an apocalyptic ceremony. 

Rackham Capital Investments has appointed Taja Gavaris as its new CFO, following the death of its former financial officer. CEO Zachary Rackham was not involved in Gavaris’s appointment, leading to speculation of a scheme to remove Rackham from the company. 

And finally, the Distant Worlds II expedition has gathered the resources required to construct a new megaship and installation in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. The fleet will now continue its journey towards Beagle Point. 

And those are the main stories this week.
