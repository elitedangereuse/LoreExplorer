* Mass Purchase of Imperial Slaves

/08 Jun 3305/

Tilbery Construction, a company based in the Eotienses system, has attracted attention following the purchase of four thousand Imperial slaves. 

Garrett Kline, the company’s CEO, explained:  

“Tilbery Construction recently won a contract to build a new water treatment facility on Eotienses A 3, serving the city of Port Isabelle. We are a young company and have not yet acquired the personnel required to meet the ambitious deadline. An alternative workforce was therefore required.” 

The anti-slavery charity Unchain has lodged a formal protest with authorities in Eotienses. A spokesperson told the media: 

“Gathering a large number of Imperial slaves in one place brings enormous risk. Conditions are often poor when transporting people in such numbers, which would violate the terms of their indentured servitude.” 

“We are also concerned with the lack of information regarding Tilbery Construction and Garrett Kline, who appears to have no experience managing such projects.”
