/19 Apr 3305/

Hadrian Augustus Duval has provided a statement regarding his recent communications with Princess Aisling Duval. 

The following announcement was broadcast on all Imperial media channels: 

“After much discussion, Princess Aisling and I have formally agreed to a non-aggression pact. While it would be premature for either side to consider the other an ally, we have pledged not to oppose each other or interfere with the activities of our respective supporters.” 

“I am grateful to my cousin for her courage in establishing contact. Although I stand firm on my previously stated beliefs, at Aisling’s request I will review Nova Imperium’s policies with an open mind.” 

“For now, I must remain a member of the Imperial family in exile.”
