* Nuclear Weapon Stolen

/16 Feb 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered that a nuclear weapon has been taken from an unregistered outpost. 

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim made the following statement: 

“Further examination of the outpost discovered last week confirms that it was home to unlicensed nuclear research. Personnel at the site were constructing a portable fusion warhead codenamed the Lucifer Device.” 

“One operational prototype was produced, but we have failed to locate it. Our assumption is that whoever invaded the base now possesses a movable bomb with a 300 megaton yield – enough to destroy an entire city.” 

“This investigation is a top priority and we are exploring all available leads.”
