* Week in Review

/28 Jul 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

Thargoid forces have entered the Witch Head Nebula in response to human colonisation efforts in the area. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research has urged independent pilots to engage Thargoid vessels in the nebula and ensure that the superpowers can establish bases close to nearby meta-alloy sites. 

In related news, Professor Palin has successfully relocated with his team to the Arque system. Palin’s megaship, Carson’s Spring, was able to fend off a number of Thargoid assaults and complete its scheduled journey. Palin’s team is currently working to establish a permanent base of operations in the system. 

Jan Sandoval, co-founder of the Red Family cartel, has been found dead in a Federal Intelligence Agency safe house. Autopsy reports confirm that a highly specialised neurotoxin was the cause of death. No suspects have been detained, but it is believed that the remaining Red Family leadership arranged the assassination. 

And finally, the Alliance Festival of Culture has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon. The festival will tour a number of Allied systems over the next seven weeks, highlighting a range of artistic and cultural achievements.  

And those are the main stories this week.
