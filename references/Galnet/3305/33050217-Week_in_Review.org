* Week in Review

/17 Feb 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

The Federal Intelligence Agency has revealed that a nuclear weapon was taken from an unregistered outpost discovered last week, where dozens of personnel were gunned down by unknown perpetrators. The portable warhead, codenamed the Lucifer Device, is believed to possess enough power to destroy an entire city. 

The Ambrose Foundation has confirmed that Lady Talitha Ambrose is missing, and that the family’s entire fortune has been lost. Believing that Lady Talitha has been kidnapped as part of the theft, the family has employed the Wallglass Investigations Agency to locate the missing heiress. 

A campaign held by the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully. The new planetary outpost will be used to study lifeforms identified by the galactic community.  

In other news, a number of priceless artefacts, spanning centuries of artistic history, have been stolen from the Museum of Civilization on Mars. In each case, the works were replaced with the image of a winking cat. 

Finally, the Atlas Research Group has called for shipments of military materials to increase security in the Merope system. The initiative started with pledges from Atlas that public safety in the face of continued Thargoid activity remains a priority.  

And those are the main stories this week.
