* Food Delivery Initiative Concludes Successfully

/22 Aug 3305/

A campaign to deliver food commodities to the Chamas system has been declared a success by its organisers. 

The Fortunes Corsairs efforts to acquire various foods for a glamorous reception were well received. The event, attended by various system officials, appears to have achieved its aim. 

Silas James of the Chamash Foods conglomerate released the following statement: 

“Due to the overwhelming support from Fortunes Corsairs and other independent traders, the delicious feast helped make our fundraiser a tremendous success. Construction of the new asteroid base will begin immediately.” 

Contributors to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Denton Dock in the Chamas system.
