* Merope Defence Initiative Concludes

/21 Feb 3305/

A military supply campaign to increase security in the Merope system has concluded successfully. 

Jacob Chowdhury, Defence Director of the Atlas Research Group, said: 

“Our gratitude to all the pilots who delivered Reactive Armour and Military Grade Fabrics. These resources will prove vital in enhancing Merope’s defences against Thargoid attacks.” 

The Atlas Research Group also helped protect traders from piracy by placing kill orders on all wanted ships in the system. 

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Reed's Rest in the Merope system.
