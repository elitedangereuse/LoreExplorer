* Week in Review

/30 Jun 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

Princess Aisling Duval, patron of the anti-slavery charity Unchain, has criticised activist group Autonomy for freeing thousands of slaves on Eotienses A 3. While sympathising with leader Garrett Kline’s motives, Duval condemned the lack of proper care or long-term consideration for the newly emancipated individuals.  

A leader of the notorious Red Family drug cartel, Jan Sandoval, has handed herself in to the Federal Intelligence Agency. Reports suggest she plans to testify against all prominent cartel members, including kingpin Oberon Church. Sandoval has been placed into protective custody, and Executive Agent Viola Trask has been assigned ownership of the case. 

And those are the main stories this week.
