* Week in Review

/14 Apr 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

The Children of Tothos cult has been forcibly disbanded following its attempt to destroy Archambault Terminal with a nuclear weapon. Federal Intelligence Agency agent Rochelle Karim was praised for exploiting the cult’s acceptance of new followers, giving her tactical team an opportunity to infiltrate the cult’s ranks. 

The Federal Intelligence Agency has denied that it is conducting a criminal investigation of Rackham Capital Investments. In a statement, the FIA said it had not contacted the journalist Bryanna Blanco to ask for access to her files. Blanco has since queried if the agents who took her data were in fact part of the FIA. 

Finally, news of a meeting between Princess Aisling Duval and Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has caused controversy throughout the Empire, with Zemina Torval branding the princess ‘an ideological traitor’. Commentators have suggested that Princess Aisling intends to steer Hadrian away from the extremist policies he inherited from Kaeso Mordanticus. 

And those are the main stories this week.
