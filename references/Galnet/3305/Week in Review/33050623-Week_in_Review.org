The role of President of the Alliance has been abolished following a majority vote in the Alliance Assembly.

The same assembly session also named Admiral Tahir West as the newest member of the Council of Admirals. 

4,000 former Imperial slaves have poured into Port Isabelle, the capital of Eotienses A 3, after being forcibly freed by activist group Autonomy.

In other news, an appeal for materials from Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force has concluded successfully. A new megaship, EFS Archangel, has finished construction and is now operational in orbit around Shana Bei 6.
