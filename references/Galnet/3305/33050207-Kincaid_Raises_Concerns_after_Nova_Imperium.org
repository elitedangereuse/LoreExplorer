* Kincaid Raises Concerns after Nova Imperium

/07 Feb 3305/

President Gibson Kincaid has sought to illustrate potential threats to the Alliance, highlighting isolationist group Nova Imperium as an example. Speaking to the Alliance Tribune, President Kincaid said: 

“The rise of such radical beliefs demonstrates how quickly the other superpowers might turn against us. Had the recent military conflict ended differently, the Empire would have callously abandoned humanity's united struggle against the Thargoid threat.” 

“All other leaders are looking elsewhere, pretending Nova Imperium never happened. But I have the courage to give a voice to our people’s fears. The Alliance must prepare to stand alone against any aggressor, whether human or alien!” 

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon later released a brief response: 

“I remind President Kincaid that his focus should be on diplomatic duties, as agreed by the Assembly. Inter-superpower cooperation against the Thargoids remains unchanged, and the Empire’s internal politics do not concern the Alliance.”
