* Week in Review

/11 Aug 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

Expansion of the Witch Head enclave has continued with the installation of seven planetary ports. Focus has turned to supporting the influx of new colonists, now that access to meta-alloys in the region has been secured. It is hoped that the new ports will accelerate ongoing efforts to repair the starports damaged in recent Thargoid attacks. 

In related news, new engineer Chloe Sedesi has opened for business at one of the new planetary facilities, Cinder Dock. Sedesi’s services have been complemented by a tech broker and material trader, available at Bray Landing and Ratchet Hub respectively. 

Finally, the Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its third week with a music festival in the Phekda system, which organisers have called ‘the greatest gig in the galaxy’. The line-up includes a mix of established and new talent, with a one-off performance by legendary artist Xiona considered the highlight. 

And those are the main stories this week.
