* Nuclear Threat Shuts Down Starport

/14 Mar 3305/

Archambault terminal in the Chun Tstar system has been overtaken by the Children of Tothos cult, who are threatening to detonate a stolen nuclear weapon. 

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim gave this statement: 

“Most services at Archambault terminal have shut down as a result of the control deck’s occupation by Children of Tothos adherents. It’s evident that personnel are obeying the cultists’ orders for fear that they will use the Lucifer Device.” 

“Millions of people remain at the starport, making a frontal assault too risky. FIA negotiators are taking steps to open a dialogue and resolve the situation peacefully.” 

The cult’s leader, Barnabas Cole, transmitted a brief message using Archambault terminal’s communications array: 

“At last, we have found the place where our testament’s light will shine. Join us. When the ceremony is complete, you will all see Tothos as we do.”
