Here are this week’s main stories. 

The Distant Worlds II expedition has reached Beagle Point, its final destination. Thousands of independent pilots have travelled over 73,000 light years in the past three months, with the establishment of Explorer’s Anchorage among their many achievements. 

President Kincaid has been accused of receiving illegal campaign funding from a senior figure at the Bank of Zaonce. Following a vote at the Alliance Assembly, Prime Minister Mahon authorised an official inquiry to establish the truth of these allegations. Kincaid is yet to provide an official response. 

In other news, the thief of a ship stolen from a starport hangar in the Vega system has been named as Gan Romero.  Security reports indicate Romero has no prior criminal record and is believed to have acted alone. The search for his motive and current location continues. 

And those are the main stories this week.
