* Golconda Receives Vital Aid

/14 Nov 3305/

The initiative in the Upaniklis system to provide the generation ship Golconda with essential supplies has concluded successfully. 

A statement was provided by Itsuko Harada of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated: 

“Sincere thanks to all traders who delivered medicines and emergency supplies, and also to the brave pilots who protected these shipments against pirate raids. Transfer of the goods to the Golconda has concluded, and I understand they were accepted gratefully.” 

The medical supplies were accompanied by representatives of the Interstellar Health Organisation, who advised the colonists on their use. Team leader Dr Ivan Johansen commented: 

“Our antiviral agents are far more advanced than those on the Golconda, and early indications suggest patients are responding well to treatment. Hopefully we have halted the outbreak of what the colony calls ‘the wasting kiss’.” 

Reports from Upaniklis government insiders indicate that communication with the Golconda has become more frequent, particularly in regards to technological advancements. Local media coverage has fuelled public speculation that the colonists should abandon their ancient vessel and establish a new home in the system. 

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now obtain their rewards from Fozard Port in the Upaniklis system.
