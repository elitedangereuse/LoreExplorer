* Distant Worlds Mining Campaign

/07 Mar 3305/

The organisers of the Distant Worlds II expedition have requested materials for two construction projects in the Galactic Centre. 

The exploration fleet aims to build a megaship and installation in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. 

Dr Kaii, Fleet Liaison for Deep Space Surveys, explained: 

“This installation will be a place for scientists to study the supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A*. Future explorers visiting the station will be well looked after by Deep Space Surveys, to whom we will hand the keys before continuing to Beagle Point.” 

Bauxite, water and liquid oxygen should be delivered to Explorer's Anchorage in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. To protect contributors, Deep Space Surveys has authorised bounty vouchers for all wanted vessels. 

The initiative begins on the 7th of March 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
