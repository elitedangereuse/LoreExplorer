* Princess Aisling Echoes Aegis Reformation Calls

/16 Jan 3309/

Princess Aisling Duval has publicly asked Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to reconsider pledging Imperial resources to a cross-superpower anti-xeno initiative. 

Her message was shared on all Imperial newsfeeds: 

“The Empire’s capability to defend itself is not in question. But neither is there any doubt that we are facing a protracted war. The ferocity and scale of the Thargoid onslaught on human space is unprecedented. Of course the Empire will survive, as it has for over a millennium… but at what cost? How many systems must fall? How many citizens will grieve for lost loved ones?” 

“Emperor Arissa, I implore you: work with the Alliance and Federation to reform Aegis. Our combined resources are needed to develop new technologies to overcome the alien armadas. Corporate interests must not dictate this path. Let Imperial ingenuity and courage light the way to victory over a common enemy.” 

A handful of senators supported Princess Aisling’s plea initially, though others have criticised her for daring to challenge the Emperor’s decree. As yet there has been no response from the Imperial Palace. 

Gudrun Vestergaard , royal correspondent for The Imperial Herald, commented: 

“There is speculation that this may cause friction between Aisling and her cousin Hadrian Duval, whose long-held isolationist beliefs are now aligned with Imperial policy. Until now both have enjoyed a close relationship, with Aisling even being chosen as honour-mother to Hadrian’s baby son Hector. But their views on Imperial foreign policy could not be more different, and recent events have brought this into sharp focus.”
