* Enhanced AX Weapon Update

/29 Dec 3308/

*Pilotsâ€™ Federation ALERT* 

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update. 

All enhanced AX weapons designed by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have now been completed. It is hoped that with these weapons improvements, humanity will be better positioned to defend itself against Thargoid invasion fleets. 

The following weapons are now available for purchase: 

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Gimballed) 

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Fixed) 

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.
