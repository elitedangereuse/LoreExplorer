* Thargoid Salvage Operation Requires Resources

/28 Jul 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Azimuth Biotech has called for commodities to be delivered to the Glorious Prospect in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system. 

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, outlined the new initiative: 

“Once the Proteus Wave has eliminated the Thargoids, the second phase of our corporate strategy will commence. As per our agreement with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, Azimuth Biotech is licensed to collect limited quantities of any remaining non-human material in the HIP 22460 system. The powerless Thargoid vessels will be taken to specialised laboratories for examination, and the subsequent results shared with the superpowers’ military intelligence divisions.” 

“Unfortunately, Azimuth has experienced significant losses in several systems, as a result of actions taken by ‘Operation Wych Hunt’ saboteurs. This has prevented us from setting up research labs and analytical equipment, delaying our xeno-retrieval programme considerably.” 

“To counteract this setback, we require shipments of HN shock mounts, micro controllers and radiation baffles. The Glorious Prospect megaship stands ready in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system to receive these deliveries.” 

As well as credit payments, Azimuth Biotech has agreed to make pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons available as an additional reward for pilots who transport the greatest volume of commodities.
