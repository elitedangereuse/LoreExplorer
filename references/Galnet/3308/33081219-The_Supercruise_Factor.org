* The Supercruise Factor

/19 Dec 3308/

Thargoid vessels are interdicting human ships travelling through systems that have been occupied by their fleets. 

The Thargoids’ ability to force craft to drop out of hyperspace is well documented. Over the past couple of weeks, pilots have reported that the interdiction ability used by human ships in supercruise is also being utilised by the alien forces. 

Colonel Bris Dekker, an engineer who specialises in frame shift drive technology, submitted his analysis to The Federal Times: 

“Being intercepted by the Thargoids mid-way through an interstellar journey is certainly a disturbing experience, but not necessarily a fatal one. Many ships have survived such encounters, unless they happen to be carrying Guardian or Thargoid artefacts. By contrast, these more recent incidents are uniformly acts of aggression, with ships being wrenched out of supercruise and immediately fired upon.” 

“We don’t know precisely how the Thargoids achieve this, though some theories are gathering support. But the intention is clear: to make the hunting of humans vessels easier. Anti-xeno pilots should note that they can no longer escape the Thargoid blasting though their shields by simply entering supercruise.” 

“Possibly, this is more of a shift in tactics than a new technological development. All reported interdictions have taken place in recently invaded systems close to the Maelstroms, rather than in the aliens’ more well-known haunts. Whatever the reason, the invading Thargoid force has adapted to more efficiently catch its prey.”
