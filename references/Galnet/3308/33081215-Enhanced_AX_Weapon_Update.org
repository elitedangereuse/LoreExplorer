* Enhanced AX Weapon Update

/15 Dec 3308/

Pilotsâ€™ Federation ALERT 

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update. 

Independent pilots have been tasked with establishing a manufacturing base at select locations in the core systems. Thanks to these focused efforts, the following weapons are now available for purchase: 

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Turreted) 

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Turreted) 

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Fixed) 

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective. 

Work continues on the other enhanced weapons, based on designs by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo which improve the original Aegis models. A further update will be provided next Thursday, unless no additional modules have been established during the week.
