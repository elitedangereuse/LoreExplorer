* Galaxy's Most Powerful People: Simguru Pranav Antal
As heir to the legacy of Simguru Rishi Antal, the master of transcendental technology, Pranav has a lot to live up to. There are many people who thought that Utopia, along with its various projects and subsidiaries, would inevitably fall apart once Rishi was no longer leading them. Pranav has proved them all wrong.

Pranav, known as Simguru Antal to his followers, not only managed to maintain the original Utopian Commune, he has actually expanded the Utopian Commune Programme to include Polevnic, Neris, Hip 117972 and Hip 1389. Never one to rest on his laurels, Pranav is already planning on expanding Utopia's reach into another half a dozen systems in the very near future.

« We live in an imperfect world, one constructed from the chaos that is this universe's random nature, » Simguru Antal told GalNet.

« The struggle of men and women to impose order through innovation and understanding is the key to humanity's ultimate happiness. The advancement of our species towards that inevitable point of peace and prosperity is not only my love, my passion, it is my very reason for being. It is the reason that all of us are here. To make our dreams, and our passions, become a reality. »

« If Utopia is to succeed, we must be driven by our righteous desires, not by our base ones. After all, it is only through mastering ourselves that we can hope to master the worlds around us. »


* A Vision of the Future
For decades, the Utopian compound on Antal was seen as a place where people could visit the future. Technology that was years ahead of its time was openly on display for anyone to see. The secrets uncovered by the Utopian engineers were made freely available for study, regardless of the factional leanings of those who wished to explore their mysteries.

That freedom of information, that willingness to share knowledge and ideas, is what has allowed Utopia to grow into a living network of technological communes that will help lead the galaxy towards a better tomorrow.

In the last five years, hundreds of thousands of scientists, programmers and engineers have begun their journey into the Utopian lifestyle. Their hard work and dedication has been rewarded with a wealth of new technologies that will revolutionise the galaxy once mass production has been achieved.

Of course, mass production is difficult without the right materials to do the job. Utopia estimates its workshops require around 30 million tonnes of assorted metals per month. So far, no single supplier has been able to meet their requirements. As such, Utopia will be offering a range of bonuses each month to any interstellar traders who bring the Utopians a large supply of metal.

Those interested in offering assistance to the Utopian Project are asked to deliver metals to Lobachevsky Station in Antal.


* Kumo Crew - Uniting the Pegasi Pirates
The presence of Archon Delaine and the Kumo Crew has long plagued the people of the Pegasi sector, and now things have started to take a very serious turn for the worse.

Having free reign for so long has emboldened Archon, who has set himself up as a self-styled Pirate King , demanding tribute and enforcing his will on the various other militant organisations operating throughout the Pegasi sector. Those who defy him find themselves shredded apart by a swarm of raging Kumo fighters.

Many of the Pegasi pirate lords have begun taking orders from Archon. In doing so, they have likewise set themselves up as local warlords who enforce Archon's will and taxes on those systems too weak to oppose them, while raiding, pillaging and pecking away at those that are not.

Two crews in particular, the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Camorra of Krisha, are currently engaged in attempts to take direct control over systems within Archon's domain. If they succeed, they will be accepted as members of the Kumo Crew. If they fail, it is likely none of them will ever be seen again.

Members of the Kumo Crew, potential allies and killers for credits alike are all invited to aid the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Camorra of Krisha in their attempts to take over Gandii and Krisha. Pirates wishing to share in the plunder can contact representatives of the crews aboard Lu Hub and Fincke Depot respectively.


* Secret Federal Anger now Onionhead Sales at all Time High
We have seen several off-the-record comments from unnamed Congressmen who are angry at the publicity Onionhead has received from the President's various announcements, and her criticism of the Admiral of the Fleet. According to reports on black market pricing, the value of Onionhead has soared throughout Federal space, despite its illegality. The 'Oniongate' protests are still ongoing, seemingly paralysing the senior leadership from taking further action.


* Latest News on Durius Situation
It seems many private pilots have been helping Senator Patreus' warships against the government of Durius, and that the government is suffering serious losses. Despite Senator Patreus' actions Durius has still not settled the debt. Governor Malachai gave the following interview from his governmental headquarters - « It is heart-warming to see the support for a down-trodden system like ours from commanders of independent ships. Sadly there are those who are siding with Patreus. We hope they will see the error of their ways before it is too late. » There are reports from sources close to Senator Patreus is pleased with his force's progress so far. Another aide quipped that that the « Governor Malachai is clearly deluding himself! »


* Slave Rebellion Breaks out in Ongkuma
Rumours are coming in from multiple sources that rebellion has broken out amongst slaves in Ongkuma. This news has surprised commentators given the speed with which the Sorbago rebellion was crushed last year. Some commentators speculate that the rebel leaders are relying on intervention from independent pilots, although many consider this to be a foolish hope after the widespread support the Senator received in the Sorbago campaign.  Indirect confirmation came from a comment in social media from a lowly shipyard loader driver, who posted that the 'Cleopatra' and the 'Marlin', two of Senator Torval's Majestic Class Interdictors, were being provisioned to leave for the Ongkuma system. Senator Torval is still on her holiday cruise on the 'Xanadu' so was unavailable for comment.


* Federal Warship Arrives in Luluwala
Senator Torval has criticised the arrival of a Federal warship now stationed in the Luluwala system. « They think they can throw their weight around. Stationing a warship at this small outpost can only be a distraction from their lack of enforcement of their own laws.  « They think stationing a cruiser in Luluwala is a show of strength? A show of real strength would be to move against slavery in the Federation. Really they are being weak. » There has been no comment from the Federal government as yet.


* Aisling Duval Talks Narcotics
In the popular show « A fireside chat with Serena », the celebrity royal, Aisling Duval, surprisingly talked through tears about narcotics - « Yes Serena, that's my early childhood. I hate narcotics and think they should be made illegal. My mother died from them before I was old enough to remember her. » When asked about her father she replied - « Oh Serena. He was led astray in his youth, but Dad is a lovely man, and would make a great Emperor if his controlling father wasn't so spiteful. » Commentators have expressed outrage at her comments about our beloved Emperor, and the network cut the broadcast at that point.


* Preparations for the Emperor's Wedding Gain Pace
Arissa Lavigny has shown the plans for her parent's wedding on the 22nd of this month, including a sneak peek at the bridesmaids' dresses. It will be a grand affair with visiting dignitaries from systems around and beyond the Empire. Rumour has it that the Federal President and Shadow President will both be invited, although many expect them to politely decline. The ceremony is to take place in the Imperial Palace, and the Emperor and his new wife will remain in specially prepared ornate travel chairs throughout as the Emperor is not expected to be fully recovered by the time of the wedding. Markets rose dramatically after the news as it would seem that the Emperor's illness is not as bad as many commentators have made out.


* Federal President Booed
This morning during the ceremony to mark the start of term at the prestigious Olympus Village University When President Halsey began her talk a large number of the assembled students began booing her. The university principal apologised profusely to the President before she left. Nevertheless the damage was done, and the event was carried on newsfeeds throughout much of human space \u2013 and her embarrassed and indecisive reaction and she attempted to proceed with her speech is now the butt of much satirical humour.


* Fallout from  Sorbago Slave Rebellion
Last night a relaxed-looking Senator Zemina Torval announced what had happened to the leaders of the Sorbago rebellion in a press conference following the return from her holiday cruise- « We managed to fight off the Federal rabble rousers due to excellent support from many independent pilots fighting to support the honourable tradition that is Imperial slavery, and I'd like to pass on my thanks to them. » Production has already restarted, and a small number of slaves that had succumbed to the persuasions of the foreign trouble-makers have now been punished. » She also commented on the recent uprising in Ongkuma. \These rabble rousers don't appear to learn very quickly. We will have the system back in working order soon.\ Senator Torval has paid generous combat bonds to independent ships that have helped her in large numbers over the last few weeks. It is understood the ringleaders of the Sorbago rebellion were executed.


* Bombing of Panem Resumes
Despite the continuing 'Oniongate' protest on the steps of Congress, Admiral Vincent has announced that surface bombing of Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system has resumed, but this time with targeted, genetically engineered biocides to destroy the onionhead crop. « Automated munitions deployed from orbit, release a gentle mist that then descends on the crop. It is harmless to humans and to other flora and fauna. » This time, the protests are more muted, and the Shadow President Hudson claimed on the political panel show 'Face the People' - « On the contrary. Now we see the layabouts are more worried about where their next onionhead fix will come from than about the farmers on Panem! »


* Federal President Clarifies Approach to Onionhead
In an attempt to quell the clamour for her resignation President Jasmina Halsey has tried to clarify the rift between the Admiral of the Fleet, Admiral Vincent, and her office. « Admiral Vincent runs our Navy, and I run the government. From time to time, he gives me a status report on naval operations, and we discuss issues of importance to the Federation. On the events in Kappa Fornacis the Admiral acted unilaterally, and simply reported his actions after the orders had been carried out. It is not my role to interfere with naval operations, but I do expect to be consulted when decisions of such import are made. » Political pundits are speculating that this carefully worded speech she read out must have been the results of negotiations between the Navy and Halsey's office. They are rumoured to detest each other, and the friendship between the Shadow President and Admiral Vincent has doubtless not gone unnoticed.


* Federal Vice President Dies in Swimming Accident
In a shocking development on Mars, Federal Vice President Nigel Smeaton was discovered dead in his private swimming pool at his luxury apartment on the foothills of Mount Olympus. A heart attack is suspected, but an investigation is ongoing. The news will come as another blow to an already beleaguered President who some pundits claim is considering resigning her post. A new VP will have to be appointed, and several senior Congressmen have suddenly been giving doorstep speeches to get themselves in the public eye.


* Changes Brewing in the Lugh System
We've received reports from the Lugh system of the Federal backed Lugh for Equality faction losing ground in the political struggle with the rising Crimson State Group. According to opinion polls support for the Crimson State Group independence movement has risen to over 66%. The staggering increase in influence has seen them victorious in a civil war against the Lugh Defence Force and thereby gaining control of the Balandin Gateway starport. Observers indicate that the group's success is due to a huge level of support from independent pilots. Financial forecasters are also astounded at the volume of trading by the Crimson State Group and are now predicting an economic boom for them. This can only come as more bad news for the beleaguered system owners. The question on everyone's lips is how will the Federation respond to this? Especially considering rumours of other Federal  systems seeking independence.


* Suspicions raised over VP Death
Fresh revelations have added uncertainty to reports Vice President Smeaton's death due to a suspected heart attack. Retrieved data from the security systems at his apartment indicate they were not functioning at the time. It's also been revealed that he completed a clean full medical scan in his private scanner only an hour before his death. His partner Alder Simons, who was not there at the time, believes Smeaton was murdered. He explained there were other irregularities such as the apartment appearing to have just been cleaned. The mystery deepened with the revelation that six minutes of the satellite surveillance data for the area appeared to have been distorted by electromagnetic interference. This does happen from time to time, but rarely in calm weather conditions such as those on the night of the Vice President's death.


* Slave Revolt in Ongkuma Crushed
Following a surprise move from the Ongkuma Progressive Party withdrawing their support for the slave rebellion, the last of the rebels have been killed or captured. In a statement Senator Torval declared - « Once again the machinations of Federal agitators have been defeated. They will never learn. They deceived some of our loyal citizens into supporting their actions, but now they have publicly admitted their fault, in this instance we will be magnanimous. » She also praised the actions of the many independent pilots who once again supported her campaign. Commentators have expressed their support for the Senator's merciful action. The Onguma Progressive Party has long been a part of the system's political landscape and their survival \u2013 even in a reduced form it continues the traditions of this system.


* Sanna and Dulos Independence Movement News
In contrasting news reports from the Sanna and Dulos systems, reporters revealed the latest on the independence movements in those systems. The Federal-supporting factions in the Sanna system are comfortably holding their ground and local commentators believe that their efforts to leave the Federation will soon collapse. In Dulos the independence movement has gained more traction thanks to the efforts of the Dulos Defence Party and their supporters. It is reported that independent pilots from around the region are providing support for both sides in the struggle.


* Aisling Duval Objects to Grandfather's Marriage
Aisling Duval has lodged an objection to the marriage of her grandfather, the Emperor to Florence Lavigny. Coming out of the Office for Marriage with her Lawyer she read a prepared statement from a cue - « I have lodged a formal objection to my grandfather marrying his fancy woman not for love, not for marriage itself, but to change the succession without having to appear in the Senate. That's all I've got to say at this time. » This unusual action will trigger a hearing of the Marriage Council in the next few days. They will review and make a decision on the validity of her objection. Experts we have spoken to believe it is unlikely to succeed.


* Major Corporation Declares Independence
In a shock move the Purple Netcoms Holdings Corporation has declared itself as independent and have called on commanders to help it to withdraw the Sugrivik system from the Federation. The CEO of the company angrily denounced the recent tax rises by President Halsey and claiming that her actions are a direct blow to the viability of the corporation and the well-being of its population. « These tax rises put people's jobs on the line and we are not going to let a President without any working knowledge of the economy ruins our lives or livelihood! » Responding to the statement a representative of Sugrivik Labour condemned the declaration and affirmed their support for the President, without explicitly supporting the tax rises.


* Extremist Leader Calls for Zero Tax Policy
Call Hagen, the leader of the League of Nabatean Defence Party, today called for a zero tax policy for citizens of the system of Nabatean at an impromptu rally. « We citizens of the Federation are treated poorly compared to the progressive policies evident within the Empire. The Federation is older and stronger but our heritage is weighed down with the bondage of taxation. Let us learn from the strong leadership of Senator Patreus and his Imperial colleagues and ensure that our own society is not a burden upon our families. » A spokesperson for the Workers of Nabatean refused to comment on what he described 'the ravings of a mad man'. Ignoring the speech may be a mistake for the current ruling party as the opposition received a massive swing in support after the speech.


* Pomp and Circumstance of the Royal Wedding
Foreign dignitaries are beginning to gather on Capitol in Achenar, in preparation for the royal wedding. Senators from throughout Imperial space have begun arriving, and many leaders from friendly independent systems too. Red carpets have been laid in local starports, and for the full length of the Imperial Avenue. Gilded open-topped speeders can be seen ferrying them to their ornate quarters at the Imperial Palace. For the ceremony itself, special wheeled gilded carriages pulled by horses. The route is already being prepared with arrays of brightly coloured flower arrangements flanking the red carpets on the tree-lined route. Huge banners carrying the Imperial Crest are being raised between the trees, and on the faces of key buildings. Many have said it is this sort of thing that shows the grandeur of the Empire at its best.


* Investigation in to VP Death Inconclusive
Despite the suspicious circumstances that have been widely reported, no further information has come to light. Social media is alleging a high level cover-up, and it seems large amounts of data have disappeared due to system failures.  President Halsey is said to be devastated, and gave a brief statement offering her sympathy to the family. It is understood there are a great many discussions going on behind the scenes to appoint a new VP, which under Federal Law must be completed within 30 days of the VP's loss. Alder Simons has given an emotional interview on the chat show 'Jenkinson'- « It's big business behind his murder. Those evil people \u2013 the military industrial complex of old \u2013 they've always been against my dear Nigel's government and its policies. Who else could launch such a big cover-up without attracting attention? »


* Emperor Seriously Unwell
Rumours are circulating that the Emperor's condition is far worse than is being admitted. One source even claimed that he has died, but that hasn't been confirmed. A senior palace source informed us that Chancellor Blaine would announce his death if it happened. We believe it likely that his sickness has merely worsened. Following the rumours there is also speculation is that his wedding to Florence Lavigny might be delayed. Imperial stock markets have dropped further on this news.


* Onionhead Now Wiped Out
Admiral Vincent, the Federal Admiral of the Fleet, has announced that the Federal Navy has now practically eliminated the narcotic 'onionhead' from Panem in Kappa Fornacis. « Our systematic destruction of the crop has now paid off, and I am pleased to say we have destroyed all the crops without the loss of a single life since the unfortunate incident a few weeks ago. »  Despite continued pockets of resistance the Admiral also announced a civic aid package to help rebuild the farms to produce less controversial crops, a move that has earned praise from commentators for its political shrewdness. In a follow up statement an aide requested that independent pilots provide Agri Medicines, Crop Harvesters, Land Enrichment Systems and Biowaste to meet the increased demand generated by the package.


* Emperor in Coma
Senator Anders Blaine, Chancellor to Emperor Hengist Duval has made a statement on the steps of the Imperial Palace- « It is with regret I have to announce that his grace, Emperor Hengist Duval's sickness has worsened, and he has fallen into a coma. His life is not in danger, he is stable, and his doctors are hopeful of a recovery. In the mean time I will of course continue in my role as Chancellor, and the Empire will continue to run under my day to day control, as it has done for the past decades, so nothing will change. » Rumours from anonymous Imperial staff are that Emperor Hengist is on a life support machine and perhaps unlikely to recover. Shares in Imperial corporations have continued to fall on the news.


* Boom Time in LHS 3447
The Future of LHS 3447 party are celebrating an economic boom in their system.  They have announced that they will share that good fortune as part of their future development initiatives. « The success of LHS 3447 is in large part due to the numbers of independent pilots who pass through and trade in this system. In fact Trevithick Dock is known for being the starting point for many pilots' careers. « In recognition of this we are subsidising a 10% discount for all pilots using the shipyards and outfitting facilities in Trevithick Dock, Dalton Gateway and Worlidge Terminal. »


* Patreus Queries Emperor's Coma in the Senate
In the first Senate session in the New Year since the public holidays, Senator Denton Patreus, Senator for Eotienses, has asked the burning question of the Senate. He directed it at the Chancellor, Senator Blaine - « It saddens us to hear that his grace Emperor Hengist has fallen into a coma, but we need to think for the future of our beloved Empire. How long will his grace be in a coma before we trigger the succession? This has not happened in over a thousand years, and it is for us to decide. One day? One week? One month? One year?  « We need a strong leader, and we should set a date in the near future when we review the situation. » There was a frisson of mumbling in the Senate after his comments and a general consensus to review the situation at the next session.


* The Menace of Illegal Racing
Traders operating in several systems have called on the authorities to clamp down on increasing levels of illegal racing- « These speeding ships are a menace! » a representative declared. « They perform dangerous manoeuvres at ridiculous speeds and that puts honest traders like us in danger. » Official comment has not been forthcoming and one such racer posted anonymously on social media stating- « The Buckyball Race is the best thing ever and I'd like to see one of the system authority Vipers try and keep up with us! »


* Dulos System Sees Massive Swing for Independence
Commentators from the Dulos system are reporting a massive swing in the popularity of the Dulos Defence Party who recently announced that they would seek to withdraw the system from the Federation. A spokesman for the party said - « Following on from our success with the economy for the markets under our control this additional boost just reinforces that our vision for the future of our system is the correct one. » An official statement from President  Halsey's office has not been forthcoming and this news can only increase the political turmoil her presidency has become embroiled in.


* Aisling Duval Reaffirms her Objection to Emperor's Marriage
Aisling Duval, once thought to be second in line to the throne, has objected to the finding of the Marriage Council that her objection had no merit. She has said on a leaked private chat - « The rotten marriage council is made up of my grandfather's cronies. How can they block my objection now it is clear he is in a coma? Marriage is about love! » The ruling of the Marriage Council was apparently made before the announcement of the coma, and under Imperial rules, an objection cannot be lodged more than once by the same person.


* Embattled Federal President Asks Us to 'Hold Firm'
In a Presidential address last night, President Jasmina Halsey gave a length speech outlining the various successes she claims her government has made over the course of their current term. However, when pressed to answer questions regarding the recent wave of systems scrambling to leave the Federal fold, President Halsey simply said - « We are facing troubled times. While it is easy for some to declare that the military are the solution, we must look further ahead. Our society fails those who need our help the most and it is by lifting those at the bottom that we will restore Federal society to what it should be. » Political pundits were quick to point out that her speech contained very little substance, with many complaining that the President had failed to address any of the actual threats that face the Federation today. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that her mishandling of the current socioeconomic climate has left the Federation weaker than it has ever been before, pointing to the recent slide of Banki and BD+03 2338 into states of lawless anarchy as prime examples of the President's continued failures.


* Rumours of Imperial Wedding Delay Confirmed
After days of widely circulating rumours that ships belonging to major dignitaries had not yet departed for tomorrow's wedding, the palace this morning confirmed that there will be a delay to the start of festivities. Chancellor Anders Blaine made an announcement on the steps of the Imperial Palace saying - « It is with deep regret I have to announce that his Grace, the Emperor Hengist Duval, remains too unwell to participate in the wedding ceremony tomorrow. As such, it is with great sadness that I must declare a temporary postponement of the intended revelries. Hopefully this will be a delay of just a few days. I will make announcements each day once we know more. » The Chancellor refused to take questions, and returned inside the palace moments after his announcement. Although there is anger amongst some lesser dignitaries that they weren't told in advance, the markets did not notably change in reaction to this news, suggesting that the true state of the Emperor's health has come as no surprise to those in power.


* Patreus Announces Generous Settlement of Dispute in Durius
Senator Patreus today announced an end to hostilities in the Durius system. The conflict in Durius began after the ruling authorities defaulted on a large debt that they'd inherited from the previous government. The Senator's civic management teams are now in the process of taking over control of the system's government in preparation for its new status as an Imperial world. As well as declaring the aforementioned changes, Senator Patreus offered a great deal of praise in response to the overwhelming number of independent pilots who travelled to Durius in order to join his cause - « In this modern age of new drive technology and rapid interstellar travel we find ourselves becoming ever more reliant on the outstanding work carried out by our honoured allies of the Pilot's Federation. Without their timely assistance many more casualties would have befallen both sides of the conflict. Not just myself, but the people of Durius owe those brave independent pilots a debt of gratitude for helping to end this war before it got truly out of hand. »


* Imperial Marriage Postponed
In a follow up to yesterday's announcement, the marriage of Emperor Hengist to his childhood sweetheart, Florence Lavigny, has now been postponed indefinitely. The news marks the first time in over five hundred years that an Imperial wedding has had to have been delayed for any reason. As well as costing the Imperial Treasury a small fortune, the delay comes as a serious blow to Arissa Lavingly's claim to the throne. Experienced commentators have noted that whilst Arissa currently enjoys the support of Chancellor Blaine, a well respected and staunch supporter of traditional Imperial values, he has previously stated that the next Emperor should follow the Duval line.


* Slave Emancipation Program Faltering
Following Aisling Duval's passionate outburst on « The Breakfast Show », it was announced today that her charitable organisation, Stop Slavery Stupid, will be increasing subsidies for various emancipation programs being run from slave rehabilitation centres in Cemiess. Stop Slavery Stupid have said that they will be using this new windfall to offer a more competitive rate of compensation to citizens willing to set their Imperial Slaves free. This renewed commitment to liberate Imperial Slaves has been met with a great deal of derision from business leaders throughout the Empire. When asked for an official comment, The Chairman of the Cemiess Workforce Acquisitions Agency had this to say - « Aisling and SSS doubtlessly mean well, but unfortunately her youthful enthusiasm and kind heart is getting in the way of her common sense. It's pretty clear Aisling doesn't understand the ramifications that would occur should she succeed in abolishing such an integral facet of our society. Never mind the fact that no one affluent enough to afford slaves would be foolish enough to simply sell them off at a loss.  Hopefully our young lady Duval will give this up before she manages to bankrupt herself in an attempt to pursue this fruitless endeavour. »


* Outcry Over Imperial Marriage Delay
Following news that the Imperial Wedding would have to be delayed indefinitely, a wave of unrest has begun manifesting itself across the Empire. Citizens from all over Imperial space have flooded popular social sites to express their disappointment, frustration and concern over the matter. One particularly angry Patron proclaimed, « It's not about the loss of business, it's about the loss of trust! It's pretty clear that the Emperor has been seriously ill for quite some time, yet the Chancellor likes to pretend that everything is okay. Well it's not okay! This latest gaffe by the Imperial Palace shows just how little attention our leaders are paying to the Citizenry on the streets, they're all too busy playing trying to grab whatever scrap of power they can, and who suffers for it? We do. »    The Chancellor's office declined to offer any new comments as to whether or not the Imperial Wedding would be rescheduled for any time in the near future.


* Sale at LHS 3447 to End
Last week the Future of LHS 3447 party generously announced that they would be sharing their recent success by offering a substantial discount on all ships purchased from the shipyards of LHS 3447. The sale has seen independent pilots flocking to the system, which in turn has led to local traders experiencing a huge boom in profits across the board.   As the sale begins to draw to a close, the Future of LHS 3447 party have issued a statement thanking all of their customers for helping stimulate the system's economy, pledging to spend a fifth of the profits earned on rejuvenating system services aboard stations throughout LHS 3447. « The last week has been simply amazing, » a representative of the Future of LHS 3447 told Galnet, « we never dreamed the response would be so positive. We can only hope that traders continue to think of LHS 3447 as a destination of choice in the future. The Future of LHS 3447 is to become a hub of interstellar commerce for all vessels passing through this sector. If you don't believe me, come visit us this weekend. The sale has to end soon! So come get yourself a bargain before it's too late. »


* Lucan Onionhead Now Cultivated in the Tanmark System
Breaking news from the Tanmark system would seem to indicate that Admiral Vincent's bombing of Panem has only slowed the spread of Onionhead. News has reached GalNet that a new strain of Onionhead, which is believed to have been cultivated in secret somewhere on Luca, with assistance from farmers from Panem in the Kappa Fornacis System has begun turning up on the local markets. A dedicated reporter managed to track down Georgio Algeria on Panem, and it seems his group have been part of this - « I said we would be back, and here we are. You cannot spoil our happiness. We are still cool. We have more friends that you realise. And now we are rich! » Due to a quirk of Federal Law, the new strain does not fall under the statue banning sale of Onionhead, as Lucan Onionhead is a different strain. Federal Labs are reported to be rushing the tests through in order to make it illegal as soon as their processes allow.


* Istanu Piracy Out of Control
An investigation into local pirate activity near the Alliance core systems has shown a focused gathering of cut-throat pirates in the Istanu system.  Miners operating in the area have been abruptly forced to leave or face death at the receiving end of high powered beam lasers.  One local miner who wished to remain anonymous (due to future health reasons) had this to say about the situation- « It's out of control! These pirates won't let an honest miner do a day's job without gettin' shot at. The Alliance aren't interested in doing anything about them! We need more independent pilots to come help clean up this mess. » Individual contractors are being informed that many bounties are up for grabs. For a point of contact, CMDR Jobedy of the Alliance Outskirt Fleet has taken lead and is forming a local militia to assist the innocent miners reclaim the system.


* Dulos to Hold Referendum on Leaving the Federation
The people of Dulos have finally begun preparations for the referendum that will decide whether or not the system retains its Federal status. At the moment the federal vote, represented by the Green Party of Dulos, is lagging behind by almost 30 points. If things don't change by Monday, the Dulos Defence Party will win by a landslide, leading the system to declare itself an independent state. Polling suggests that the movement for independence has enjoyed strong support amongst the local populace, a sentiment which is becoming more and more common among systems positioned outside of the Federal core, though in the last few days Federal supporters have become more active. Of course not everyone is eager to leave the Federation behind. The independence movement in Sugrivik has failed to sway local voters to their cause, despite a significant amount of credits being spent by Purple Netcoms Holdings in an attempt to persuade people to back their play for independence. When asked for comment in regards to the Dulos referendum, President Halsey's office issued a statement saying that the President trusts the people of Dulos to do the right thing.


* 26 JAN 3301
Previously Unknown Explorer Returns from Outer Rim Lincoln station played host to a rather eclectic delegation of scientists this weekend, as word spread of the return of Erimus Kamzel from his lengthy expedition to our galaxy's Outer Rim. Commander Erimus' journey, which started in Sol, saw our intrepid explorer travel a total of a staggering 144,000 light years before he was able to return home.   Part of the journey saw Erimus pass through the Galactic Core, where he was able to collect great swathes of data on areas such as the Greae Phio Stellar Forge, the Phipoea Nebula and the Dryad Chrea Stellar Remnant. Perhaps most exciting of all, Commander Erimus is believed to have mapped out a whole host of previously unexplored areas of space beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Arm. Federal, Imperial and Independent scientists from institutions all over occupied space are now engaged in a hot bidding war to see who will be the first to get their hands on Commander Erimus' records. Erimus has issued a statement saying that he believes his discoveries should be shared freely with all humanity. To which effect he has released a series of video logs that can be viewed right now by searching your local video network for Distant Suns.


* Sale at LHS 3447 Ends
The Future of LHS 3447 Party, in partnership with the LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co Corporation, would like to take this opportunity to thank customers both old and new for their continued patronage. The last week has seen an unprecedented number of traders pass through the system, with reports indicating that profits are up over 500% across the board. The biggest winners were the shipyards in Dalton Gateway, who saw profits soar an unprecedented 65 fold after selling a record breaking 2364 ships in just 5 days. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a large portion of those profits can be attributed to unprecedented sales of the ever popular Lakon Type 9 Heavy and its little sister the Lakon Type 7.  Members of the local community flocked to social media to praise the leadership of the Future of LHS 3447 Party, not only for increasing trade across the board, but also for their continued commitment to making LHS 3447 a hub of Federal activity for the surrounding sector.


* Dulos Announces its Intention to Secede
A record number of people turned out to vote on the matter of an Independent Dulos this weekend, so much so that local station services found themselves struggling to contain the sheer number of visitors to the system.  While the battle was hard fought, with impassioned last minute campaigning coming out from both sides, in the end the Defence Party of Dulos managed to garner a staggering 75% approval rating for their move towards an Independent Dulos. The Federal representatives, the Green Party of Dulos, have said that they will not be contesting the vote. This news will come as quite a blow for President Halsey, whose heavy handed rule of Federal Frontier systems has seen a number of far flung provincial governments start to question the value of maintaining ties with Sol. Doubtless this most recent defection will be watched with great interest by powers throughout the galaxy, although exact details regarding a roadmap towards true independence for Dulos has yet to be announced.


* The Silver Comet
The bounty hunter gossip columns are abuzz with a reported sighting of the fabled 'Silver Comet'. A long-standing superstition states that \anyone who sees the Silver Comet will die,\ and it seems this latest sighting will only serve to reinforce the myth. The report came from Quiness by pilot Johanna Meister, Deadly rank, who has since disappeared - last sighted in the Alioth system. The Federal Navy dispatched a taskforce to investigate the mysterious comet's appearance in Quiness, although so far they claim to have uncovered no evidence to support Commander Meister's claim.  This news hasn't stopped independent hunters from getting curious. Silhar Bradeus, head of the Bounty Hunters Guild, has offered a hefty reward for any information on the Silver Comet or the location of missing pilot Johanna Meister.


* Congressman Had Early Knowledge of VP's Death?
The press furore over the death of the Federal Vice President has been given a new burst of life, after a recording of a local constituency meeting was released on the scurrilous news channel 'The Low Down'. In the otherwise low-key meeting held in a village outside Quenisset, Mars, on January 12th, the local mayor offered his condolences to the family and friends of a local businessman murdered during a robbery earlier in the week. George Fallside, the local Congressman, was present at the meeting. The Congressman, who was clearly distracted by social media at the time of the meeting, followed the mayor's speech by offering his condolences to the Vice President's family. This was an hour after the VP's death, but half an hour before the news of his death broke. The Congressman was not available for comment, but an aide has said - « Is it a big deal? He clearly misheard what was said. » On 'The Low Down' they followed up by emphasising the Congressman's links with the military, and in particularly his non-exec directorship of Core Dynamics.


* Vive La R\u00e9volution De Lave
Word circulated recently on the Galnet boards that a coalition of pilots of French origin (a country from ancient Earth, whose descendants still speak an archaic dialect) were planning to launch a violent coup aimed at gaining control of Lave station. As home to one of the galaxy's finest flight schools, Lave holds deep sentimental value to many pilots from all walks of life. Lord Ryan of Ugain was the first to hit back, « My family emigrated from Lave to the Empire back in the days of Walden! We won't let the system succumb to tyranny again! »  Commander Ulysses Wolf, an Imperial Explorer, also hit back, « We won't just stand by and let it happen! » Many other pilots also voiced their discontent, suggesting that if a French Coalition did attempt a takeover they'd have more than just local Alliance Forces to deal with. President James Gibson of Lave couldn't be reached for comment.


* Mistaken Identity Leads to Outrage Amongst Explorers' Association
In a surprising twist to a story published earlier in the week, it would appear that the man previously believed to have been Commander Kamzel of the DSS Beagle, was in fact an imposter who had stolen the Commander's identity in order to try and sell millions of credits worth of bogus data. According to the real Commander Kamzel's support team, the last communiqu\u00e9 from the intrepid explorer had come just days before the imposter had carried out his plan to impersonate the Commander. The communiqu\u00e9 in question stated that the Commander's trusty ASP, the DSS Beagle, had received significant damage while in the outer reaches of the galaxy.  Lincoln station security services believe that the imposter managed to intercept the message to Kamzel's team, at which point the thief decided to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the DSS Beagle in order to steal millions of credits.   It is believed that Commander Kamzel is currently on his way towards the Scutum-Centaurus arm, at which point he will attempt to send an encrypted signal to his team in case a rescue operation is needed.


* Senator Offers Deep Discounts on Military Surplus
Following on from the cessation of hostilities in Durius, civic management teams operating on behalf of Senator Patreus have declared that they will be holding a fire sale to clear out any excess equipment which the citizens of Durius no longer require. It is hoped that the sale will generate some much needed capital for the impoverished region, although how many of the credits will be directly spent on the Durius system remains unknown. When asked to comment on the matter, Senator Patreus's office said that a fair repayment schedule has been organised. They went on to state that most of the credits accrued would be left in the hands of the Citizens of Tradition, who will continue to manage the day to day running of Durius for the foreseeable future. It is not clear at this stage whether this will cover the repayments. Any pilots interested in saving themselves some serious credits on small non-Imperial ship upgrades are advised to head over to the Speke Prospect outpost in Durius immediately. Sale only while stocks last!


* Federal Crackdown in Banki and BD+03 2338
The Federation has started to insist that its member states follow procedure if they wish to leave. Congressman Jefferson, the Secretary of State for Finance said - « We will take a firm stance against States withholding their contributions to the Federal budget. If States wish to leave, then they must follow the proper procedure. It may be unpopular, but that is what they agreed to. » Reports are coming in that representatives of the Federal Navy have been deployed to Banki and BD+03 2338 with explicit orders to bring the systems back under Federal Law. Independent pilots interested in gaining favour with the Federation are being asked to assist the Gold Advanced Partners in Banki, and the Progressive Party in BD+03 2338. Both groups have been given access to sizeable war chests by the Federal Navy.


* Citizens Show Strong Support for Aisling
Seven days after the program to help free Imperial Slaves before the end of their agreed term was started, Stop Slavery Stupid has claimed that over 100,000 Imperial Slaves have been brought to Cemeiss to be freed in the Diva Duval's name.  With her grandfather, the Emperor, unable to fulfil his duties as head of state, this surge of support could mark the start of Aisling making her own move to claim the Imperial Throne. When asked to comment, Aisling said she was « super thrilled » that so many people are willing to support a cause so close to her heart. An Imperial source, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us - « It was only a tiny number of commanders, only a hundred that supported this scheme, each making multiple deliveries. 'Her team' behind her are shady individuals after the power of the throne. This is a stunt. Signing up as an Imperial Slave to repay a debt is no different to signing up for the Military. »


* Lucan Onionhead Declared an Illegal Narcotic
After a week of hurried testing and rushed legislation, finally Lucan Onionhead has been declared an illegal narcotic in all sectors of Federal space. This new statute was rushed onto the books in response to the appearance of a new, slightly modified strain of Onionhead in the Tanmark system. Onionhead has proven to be a contentious issue among Federal communities over the last few months. The drug is extremely popular among young adults, with many claiming the use of Onionhead is completely harmless.  President Halsey disagrees, pointing to reports by respected Federal scientists that warn of the dangers associated with the popular narcotic. Evidence collected by Federal scientists supposedly suggests the neurological damage being done by the drug not only causes severe impairment of judgement in the short term, but that it may also cause amyloid plaques to form throughout the brains of long term users. Such studies have yet to be made available to the public.


* Rejuvenation of Kappa Fornacis Underway
While protests on Mars continue, things are looking up for the beleaguered people of Kappa Fornacis, as Federal support agencies have begun delivering aid packages to those affected by the recent bombardment of the Onionhead fields on Panem. One of the protesters on the steps of Congress jeered at this - « It is a cynical ploy to undo the bad publicity from the bombing. The Federal Navy should never have attacked a peaceful planet  - the farmers were taking advantage of a naturally occurring crop. » Entrepreneurial commanders looking to capitalise on the federal grant to rebuild Kappa Fornacis are being asked to source Agricultural Medicine, Crop Harvesters, Terrain Enrichment Systems and as much Biowaste as possible. All goods should be delivered to the logistics centre aboard Harvestport. Georgio Algeria of the Farmer's Union on Panem said - « We did OK from Onionhead. Here and on Luca. We're here to stay. Keep your stinking aid. Be happy. Onionhead helps! »


* CN Bootis Rapid Wealth Expansion
The United CN Bootis Progressive Party announced its plan for system expansion today, eliciting a negative response from other factions in the system. The Progressive Party has increased its controlling influence of the system over the past week by over 10% with the aid of mercenary pilots. A spokesman said - « We have stepped up trading at Sellings City dock, and have increased our patrols of all seven Resource Extraction Sites in the system. We have met with significant push-back from local pirate factions. Fighting is intense, but profitable to successful pilots. » « We are hiring miners, traders, and bounty hunters to help us continue our takeover of the system. » Opposing factions could not be reached directly for comment. Stay tuned for updates. CMDR Otalp


* Vesper-M4 Plays Unwilling Host to Demolition Derby
Slough Orbital hosted the galaxy's inaugural SIDEWINDER DEMOLITION DERBY last Sunday and it was a huge success. The event, which will now be held on the first Sunday of every month, sees pilots flying their basic, weapons and shield-free Sidewinders at full speed around the airlock ring in an attempt to blow each other up.  Slough Orbital's Captain, Commander Rose, has expressed frustration at these troubling turn of events. Telling GalNet - \The Jet Transport Corporation lost a lot of trade last Sunday. No ships were able to enter or leave the station for almost an hour for fear of being blasted into smithereens by these lunatic pilots.\ Commander Angel Rose, daughter of Captain Rose, has praised the event, saying - \My father is a stuffy old codger. Everyone had a lot of fun, especially this month's derby winner, Commander Scicobalt. No-one was actually hurt, although Commander Belstarion's pride took a big dent when he got repeatedly stuck in the stations superstructure. I look forward to doing it all again next month!\


* Trouble on the Fringe - Balaikda
It seems that even the edges of colonised space aren't free of problems. A civil war has broken out in Balaikda between two of the system's minor factions, namely HIP 43760 State Plc and Balaikda Ltd. The former is Federation-aligned and unsurprisingly calls the nearby HIP 43760 home, while the latter is a local firm.  Observers have reported a heavy handed response to this Federal involvement in an Imperial system, resulting in the Imperial Navy setting up checkpoints near a number of local planets. One source, who asked to remain unnamed, said \these checkpoints are manned by Elite Vipers and Cobras fitted with Plasma Accelerators, and so not to be taken lightly.\  Battles have broken out across the system, with various local factions offering combat bonds in an attempt to urge independent pilots to lend a hand in the small scale factional struggle.


* Federation Withdraws from Panem
Following on from the deployment of Federal aid to the beleaguered farmers of Panem, President Halsey has today announced her intention to recall all Federal forces from Kappa Fornacis. The President has said of this - « I am pleased with how our marines-turned aid workers were able to help restore order to Panem so quickly - exemplary of what the Federation can offer its allies. » The leader of the Kappa Fornacis Farmer's Association, Georgio Algeria, has denounced the Federation's efforts. He said to gathered reporters - « Don't be fooled by the Federation. They're liars! This is just window dressing. They bully us, they burn us, now they try to buy us. Well we ain't scared and we ain't for sale. We say what happens on Panem, and we say Onionhead will live on! »


* Spassky's Inheritance, Mikunn
The Dukes of Mikunn have begun sanctions against the dictatorial Law Party of HR 7327, in the HR 7327 system. As such, commerce to the Law Party owned Gabriel Station will be under blockade until such time as a regime change occurs. As the Dukes of Mikunn currently hold majority influence in the system, the reins of power at Gabriel Station should naturally pass to the Duchy of Mikunn.  For the safety of all private traders, their Graces the Dukes have requested that independent pilots should stay clear of HR 7327, and Gabriel Station in particular, until further notice.  Traffic should be routed to the neighbouring systems of Sukua, Kwatee and of course, Mikunn. Commanders interested in toppling the dictatorship of the Law Party should make their way to Mikunn and contact Commander Lucifer Wolfgang, Commander Calomiriel, or his Lordship the Count of Monte Fisto. Soda Popinski, Media Relations, Duchy of Mikunn


* It's Not All About Sovereignty
The past few months have seen dozens of frontier systems launch initiatives to break away from Sol, due in no small part to the higher taxes being charged by the Federal government. The most recent referendum on Federal membership took place in the Dulos system, where an overwhelming 75% of the population voted to leave the Federation and become an Independent state. However, in recent weeks there has been a surge of support for the Federal government all across occupied space. Where previously there were tens of dozens of independent movements pushing to break away, all but a small handful of them have now fizzled out. Pundits point to actions taken by Admiral Vincent of the Federal Navy to protect the interests of member states at short notice, as the cause of this most recent shift in opinion.


* Sickness Spreading Through Ngaliba
A wave of sickness has spread through Ngaliba, leading the Federal Centre for Disease Control to issue an amber alert warning all pilots to avoid Fullerton Horizons until further notice. Anyone who has visited Ngaliba in the past five days is advised to seek immediate medical attention and avoid controlling machinery, flying starships, and travelling through hyperspace. Early signs of infection include dizziness, nausea, stomach pains and a loss of concentration.  The Crimson Major Solutions have declined to offer any comment in regards to how many people are known to be infected.


* Patreus Fire Sale in Durius Ends
The mass selling off of all surplus military assets from the Speke Prospect armoury was carried out at the behest of Imperial Senator Denton Patreus, to whom the people of Durius owe a rather significant debt. The Citizens of Tradition, acting in their position as custodians of Durius, have promised to use their newly acquired funds to further stimulate the local economy through the creation of new employment opportunities. To that end, Senator Patreus, in association with Senator Torval, has generously offered to provide free training for all debt- ridden citizens of Durius  willing to be retrained for work as Imperial Slaves to clear their remaining debt.


* Long Lost Station Returns
Some years ago Jaques' Station left its orbit around the moon of Topaz. It's mission? To discover new beverages, explore distant stars, and bravely go where no starport had been before. When the starport left on its journey the station was being captained by the toughest barman in all of occupied space, a part-Cyborg known only by the moniker of Jaques. Jaques' transformation from man to machine began during the time he served as a member of the Quinentis Fourteens, a Federal black ops strike team. His unit was captured by enemy forces during the Battle of Hell's Gate.  The intrepid ex-soldier spent close to the next 200 years improving his cybernetic implants and saving up to buy the station in order to head off and explore the stars in style, and he is happy for people to join him. Stay tuned to GalNet to find out all the latest developments as they occur.


* Planning Underway for New Frontier Station
Universal Cartographics have today announced their intention to launch a new exploration station. Plans for the development of the new station are already well underway, although the ultimate destination has yet to be chosen. Members of Universal Cartographics and the Explorers' Association were asked to submit proposals as to the most useful location for the station. The following have been identified as candidates - HIP 101110      SYNUEFE FR-T B36-3       Maia   HIP 117585 HIP 27215  The board has requested that members of the Pilots Federation provide additional system data to help finalise the decision.


* Prism Senator Courts Controversy Again!
In a move which is likely to further increase tensions between the Federation and the Empire, a high ranking Lady of the Empire has been denied access to the Sol system. Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, the Senator from the Prism system, was on a diplomatic mission at the behest of Chancellor Blaine when her Imperial Courier was interdicted whilst jumping into the Sol system. According to Imperial sources, Lady Kahina's vessel came under attack by unidentified ships, but fought its way free despite suffering significant damage during the incident. Federal representatives insist that the Imperials failed to file a valid itinerary, which resulted in a lack of an escort through Federal space. The Empire has demanded a formal apology from the Federation, but so far this demand has gone unanswered. Lady Kahina was quoted as saying, \I don't like to be late.\


* Celebration at Abraham Lincoln Starport in Earth Orbit, Sol
Pilots from around the galaxy are expected to gather outside Abraham Lincoln Starport, located in Earth orbit in the Sol system, at 18-00 on the 12th of February for the annual remembrance of the Station's namesake, President Abraham Lincoln.  This date marks the 1,492nd anniversary of Lincoln's birth. Lincoln, president of one of the great democracies of the Northern Hemisphere in Earth's 19th century, is credited with ending the practice of human slave trafficking in that nation. Pilots gather each year at Abraham Lincoln Starport to show their solidarity in ending the galactic slave trade by flashing their ships' headlights for 30 seconds at precisely 18-00 on the evening of the anniversary. - CMDR Jaiotu


* Yembo-Crowdsourcing Required to Help Build New Station
After a week of speculation, Universal Cartographics have today announced that the system chosen to receive what is planned to be the first of a new fleet of UC controlled Explorer Station's will be HIP 101110. Samuel Covington, the leader of the committee in charge of choosing HIP 101110 as the target location, had this to say about the announcement - « Hopefully this will be the first step in putting a more robust support system in place for all the brave men and women who risk their lives out there in the black. It won't be easy establishing a station so far away, but we believe the rewards far outweigh any obstacles that might crop up along the way. » Partial construction of the new station will take place in the shipyards of Yembo. Anyone capable of sourcing metals are advised to get themselves over to Naddoddur Terminal - Yembo straight away, as Universal Cartographics are offering some exceptional incentives to Commanders helping with their current construction efforts.


* Compassion was the Cure for Ngaliba
The community of Ngaliba managed to avoid a fate worse than death this past weekend, as hundreds of aid workers flew to the region to help find a cure for the plague that had been ravaging its way through the system. Imperial, Federal and Independent pilots from all walks of life came together to provide the vital resources needed to save countless lives. Thanks to their efforts there were less than a dozen confirmed causalities before a cure was finally found. Samples of the Ngaliba Plague have been sent on to all major virus repository databases as protection against any potential future outbreaks.


* Soontill Alien Artefacts to be Auctioned at Ngurii
Soontill is back in the news this week as fresh rumours have surfaced of alien items hitting the market in Ngurii.  It's been nearly two decades since Gallagher Restoration's auction of Soontill relics was discovered to be merely an outrageous publicity stunt. Although many high profile individuals were left red faced after the Phekda auction, most notably the band Jjagged Bbanner, it seems people still want to believe in the Thargoid legend. Indeed, several familiar names have already come forward enquiring about the new finds.  What gives the latest rumours more credence than previous claims is the fact that the source of the alien items is not just one individual or one group, but several different lone wolf pilots. Is this another hoax?, Another stunt?


* Lucan Onionhead Farmers Welcome Agricultural Commodities Traders
Reports have reached GalNet that Lucan Onionhead farmers in the Tanmark system have been receiving regular supplies of Agricultural Medicine, Crop Harvesters, Land Enrichment Systems and Biowaste from intrepid traders sympathetic to their cause. \This is welcome news\ said Georgio Algeria of the Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union. \A few Commanders helped us in Panem, and that's cool but not enough. If enough of you can help get them to Tanmark we'll be happy. And so will you. This is the way we make Onionhead bigger, better. It's what we all want. Long live Onionhead! Lucan Onionhead for all! » No Federal representatives were available to comment.


* The Legend Returns
It's been some time since Jaques began his epic journey from orbit around the moon of Topaz into the mysterious places of the great unknown. A week ago we reported that Jacques Station was seen by an intrepid commander in HIP 110620.

What mysteries will the enigmatic cyborg see on his long travels? Emma Hallows, asked Jaques those very same questions the robotic barkeep responded-

\If people want to know my story, they'd best come buy a drink and find out for themselves.\


* Underground Racers Spotted In and Around Sol
Unsanctioned Fight Club -  Chelomy Vison, Balaikda

The war might be over, but the battle lives on in Balaikda with the arrival of the Chelomy Vision fight club.

In this club, members engage in unsafe, unsanctioned brawls in the skies above Chelomy Vision. The winner goes home covered in credits and glory, while the losers get an all weekend pass to the medical centre.

Last week the club ran a stock sidewinder event, and the carnage was brutal. This week the competition is expected to be even more fierce, but with so many credits up for grabs, independent pilots are expected to fly in from all over to prove they've got the skills to pay the bills. Meetings take place weekly at 05-00 sharp universal time.


* Restoring Sanity to Anarchy in Banki and BD+03 2338
As the Federal Navy begins to move into position around Banki and BD+03 2338, independent Commanders from all corners of the galaxy have started gathering at Antonio De Andrade Vista in Banki and Matteucci Terminal in Khasiri in preparation for the final set of engagements against the Federal rebels.

The Federal Navy has issued a warning calling for all civilians to evacuate the areas around Banki and BD+03 2338 immediately. The official policy being that any unidentified ships caught in the coming conflict will be treated as enemy combatants, meaning they will most likely be destroyed on sight.

All loyal members of the Federation are requested to report to either Antonio De Andrade Vista in Banki or Matteucci Terminal in Khasiri to receive orders as to how they can best lend their support to the Federal Navy. Non-combat roles are available for conscientious objectors.


* The St. Valentine's Day Regatta
Captain Millington, chief of racing operations, has finally announced the details of this year's St. Valentine's Regatta, one of the most prestigious events on the yearly racing calendar. The race, which begins in the Kumbaya system, will see participants follow a gruelling 500ly route that passes through some of the most dangerous areas in the surrounding sectors.

 \As every pilot knows, St. Valentine's is a gruelling test of nerve and daring, a headlong dash from one side of inhabited space to the other. Many enter, but only one can win. In the 37 years of the race's history (excluding 3284, when it was cancelled due to the civil war) this race has never been won by a pilot with less than exemplary skill. Many winners have gone on to become legends, so join us on the 14th to find out who will be next to ascend to glory amongst the stars.\

Any last minute entrants should contact Commander Kitiara for more information on how to sign up.


* Underground Racers Spotted In and Around Sol
Word has spread that a group of CMDRs piloting Core Dynamics' Eagle Fighters were spotted conducting high speed races near the Sol system. Traders visiting Ashby City in Luyten's Star report that they spotted the pilots engaging in dangerous manoeuvres through the docking slot and around the station. Similar reports came from the Altair System where patrons of the Solo Orbiter Station were met with several colorfully-painted Eagles upon arrival.



« The pilots made it clear they meant no harm, their hardpoints were retracted and subsystem scans indicated that the spacecraft were not equipped for combat. »



Rumour has it that this underground racing circuit began around the Earth-Moon System in nearby Sol. It seems that for now the Federation are willing to turn a blind eye to these events, as Federal Security Forces have made no attempts to intervene.

* Banki and BD+03 2338 - Over by Breakfast!
In a speech delivered from Navy Headquarters, Admiral Vincent has expressed his pleasure over the progress being made by Federal Forces engaged in the reclamation of Banki and BD+03 2338.

« The ongoing conflicts in Banki and BD+03 2338 were not started by us. They started at the beginning of the year when lawless thugs took it upon themselves to invade their smaller, peaceful neighbours. Despite any distractions President Halsey might be facing in her failure to find a replacement for our late Vice President Smeaton, the Federation will not stand idly by while foreign powers invade federal territory under the guise of locally formed separatist movements. »

The Admiral went on to say:

« All foreign, and indeed any domestically grown, terrorist rebels we find will be dealt with decisively. Our troops are doing extremely well, and thanks to the pinpoint strikes being carried out by my men on the ground, I expect the majority of the fighting will be over by the time I have breakfast tomorrow. »


* Patreus Slave Sale Ends
It's been an interesting week for the people of Durius as they continue to undergo assimilation into the greater Imperial fold.

As part of that process, the management team in charge of Durius were able to offer debt relief retraining to 12070 newly minted citizens. As a result, 12070 Imperial Slaves found themselves exported from Durius to other parts of the Empire over the last week. A move that was partly facilitated through a newly formed business arrangement between Senator Patreus and Senator Torval.

Senator Patreus has said of this:

« I am glad the remaining citizens of Durius have freely entered the honourable Imperial tradition and agreed to repay their share of the debt by voluntarily becoming Imperial Slaves until their debts are fully repaid. I wish them well. »

Given the fact that the remaining citizenry are in good financial standing, the temporary sale of Imperial Slaves from Durius has now come to an end.


* The Sorry Fate of Hank Stone
Residents of Toolfa Large were left in shock this weekend after local security services found a small fortune in raw gold sitting aboard what they presumed to be an abandoned Sidewinder in one of the station's lower hangers. The ship's records indicate that its owner, a Mr Hank Stone, had spent the last month alone in the LAWD 26 system, where he had found a previously untapped source of precious metals.

After a brief investigation it was discovered that a Mr Hank Stone, of no fixed abode, has been found dead in his bunk at Toolfa Large Short Stay Inn several days beforehand.

Mr Stone is believed to have passed away due to chronic liver failure, a state that was no doubt exasperated by the half dozen empty bottles of Eranin Pearl Whiskey that were found strewn about his cabin.


* Effinger Port Furbaide Reports Contagion Spreading Unchecked
Despite a valiant effort by medical staff working aboard afflicted stations in Liaedin, LHS 3505 and Furbaide the illness now known as Volungu Blight has managed to evade all attempts to contain it.

The virulent disease has managed to claim hundreds of lives since it first appeared just 24 hours ago.

In an attempt to combat the spread of the Blight, a rapid response team has been set up aboard Effinger Port station in the Furbaide system. This team will be working around the clock to find a cure, but they can't do it alone.

Dr Miriam Fletcher, head of the Furbaide CDC, has requested that anyone shipping basic medicines divert to Effinger Port in order to donate the supplies needed to stop the Blight before it manages to spread any further.


* A Question of Security
During a gathering of patrons held on Eotienses earlier today, Senator Denton Patreus received a standing ovation after delivering a stirring speech on the importance of internal security.

« We live in uncertain times my friends, » the Senator began. « The health of the Emperor is failing and the wolves are at our door. Even here, close to the very heart of our Empire, there are dangers lurking in every shadow. »

The Senator went on to say:

« It might surprise you to learn that just 30 mere lightyears from where we stand bloody handed chaos reigns supreme. The criminals of Falisci use their privileged sovereignty to peck away at law abiding Imperial states, and they are far from the only ones to do so. Is it not our honour bound duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves? We must purge the Empire of these parasites in our midst. Only then will we be free to achieve our true destiny. »


* New VP Appointed
In a formal ceremony in the Congress building on Mars, Congressman Ethan Naylor, the Congressman for Siren  was formally signed in as the Federal Vice President.

This is a controversial choice as this is the first time a member of the Federal Leadership has been a Congressman from a frontier world. Some have said that President Halsey is reacting to critics that here government is too Sol-centric, and others that she may regret the choice.

In his appointment speech Naylor said:

« I am honoured to have this phenomenal role. I will see it as my job to see that Federal States on the frontier will get the attention they deserve. »


* Station Construction Now Underway
Thanks to the combined efforts of entrepreneurs, small business owners and corporate sponsors, preparations for the launch of the new EAUC Exploration Ocellus are now well underway. 4871 commanders contributed over 8154177 tons of metal to the project, which in turn has allowed the EAUC coalition to outfit the station to a level far beyond their original specifications.

Universal Cartographics has released a statement thanking the committee members who wisely chose the mineral rich system of HIP 101110 as the potential launch site, as well as to Zimm_Macugz for organising the delivery of an impressive 150000 tonnes of raw materials.

The new station is expected to be ready for its maiden voyage to HIP 101110 now know as New Yembo within the next few days.


* The Fastest Pilot in the Galaxy
This is Casey Murrow and today I'm talking exclusively with Commander Samwell Drakhyr, winner of this year's big race, the St. Valentine Day Regatta. So just how did you manage to win it all Sam?

\A bad pilot is controlled by their ship. They are surprised all the time, because their mind is in harmony with neither ship nor surroundings. A good pilot controls their ship. They are surprised only half the time, because they know the limits of their ship so well that it is becomes part of them, directed by the pilot's will without conscious effort, like a limb.\

\I strive to go beyond that. I scout my route until I own it. I make it part of me. I do my thinking in advance so when I fly on the day there is no mind, no ship, no pilot that exists as separate entities. My hands move, yet in a way it feels like they are steady, inevitable, and it is instead the universe itself that is moving.\

Excellent and inspiring advice there from Commander Drakhyr, champion of the 37th almost annual St. Valentine Day Regatta.


* The Long Trip Home
After a week of wandering in HIP 110620 the Jaques Starport is now making its way through HIP 110079. GalNet is still no closer to learning the reason behind the station's unexpected return, nor can we ascertain where the cyborg barman's ultimate destination may be.

A number of well known commanders from all walks of life have been seen coming in and out of Jaques, which is fast becoming a popular nightspot among young thrillseekers from the Empire, Federation and Alliance alike.

Now that his self-imposed exile has finally come to an end, Jaques appears content to simply wander the stars in the company of a people he once called his own, accompanied by the booming sound of a dark electric beat.


* President Orders Attack on Nijotec
In a shock announcement issued this morning, President Halsey has ordered an all out assault on the Nijotec region.

In her address to the Federation, President Halsey had this to say on the matter:

« For too long the Nijotec Syndicate have been preying on the weak, innocent and infirm. I stand before you today to tell you that the Federation will not stand idly by while a supposedly legitimate independent nation abuses its own people. These openly criminal states are nothing more than self-serving parasites that have no place in greater galactic society. Let the liberations of Nijotec, Banki and BD+03 2338 serve as warnings to any tin-pot dictators who think they can send their own little slices of civilisation back to the dark ages. »

Nijotec is a small system that acts as a permanent home to just 21,500 people. In the past it was well known for its rich mineral deposits, although the system has since been strip-mined to the point where the local refineries are currently exporting very little produce. The recession in the region and the subsequent abandonment of the sector's two outposts by the Lycan Moon Mining Corporation provided fertile ground in which the criminal group known as the Nijotec Syndicate were able to flourish and grow.


* Taking the Fight Home
Following the Federation's success in routing the rebel forces from Banki and BD+03 2338, Admiral Vincent has declared his intention to follow the invaders of BD+03 2338 back to their own homes.

\I think the message is clear,\ Admiral Vincent declared at press conference earlier today. \We will not allow terrorists to break our laws or brainwash our people. The Polahukuna Raiders, and those like them, need to learn that their actions have consequences. The Federation will not sit idly by and let the infections of chaos and anarchy spread and fester.\

The Admiral went on to say that he would reveal plans as to the nature of the Federation's foray into Polahukuna shortly.


* Crackdown in Cemiess
There's trouble brewing in Cemiess, caused in no small part by the recent influx of emancipated Imperial Slaves who now call the area their home.

The number of petty thefts and burglaries being reported on Emerald has risen by over 300% compared with the same period in 3300, resulting in local social sites being flooded with complaints from long term residents who claim they fear for their families' safety.

In response to the unrest, Commissioner Chamberlain of Emerald Security issued the following statement:

« While we appreciate the situation may feel like it's spiralling out of control, we do advise all citizens to remain calm. Crime is up, but no more than what we might expect to see after any large group suddenly moved into the area. We understand residents are concerned about their security and as such a curfew is being put into effect. However, we would like to stress that this is purely a temporary measure until such time as our newest residents have integrated more fully with the local community. »


* Vesperian Auction Today Only
The galaxy is abuzz with excitement following the news that an anonymous donor has contributed a case of highly valuable and extremely rare Vesperian Nectar to the charity SpecialEffect, an organisation dedicated to leveraging technology in order to enhance the quality of life for people with physical disabilities .

Vesperian Nectar is produced from the nectar of Vesperian Orchid flowers, a plant that only grows on the planet Slough in Vesper-M4. The exceptional sweetness of this honey has baffled scientists and foodologists for centuries, as the atmosphere on Slough itself is both toxic and highly acidic. The honey is made by the Vesperian « Orchid Bee », an insect well known for its deadly sting. Vesperian beekeeping is a risky business, with numerous deaths occurring amongst keepers each year.

Commander Angel Rose will be holding private auctions on behalf of SpecialEffects throughout the day.


* Lugh Makes a Bold Step Towards Independence
The Alioth system has been at the centre of controversy today after the arrival of \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghire, the leading spokesperson in the current bid for independence of the Lugh system.

While at the time of this report Ambassador U\u00ed Laoghire has not yet been granted an audience with Alliance state officials, he did address the huge throngs of supporters who came out to greet him on the steps of the state residence.

\Since its earliest inception the Lugh system was settled by a sovereign people of one lineage and one religion who have made it their spiritual home. Popular support for The Crimson State Group in the last polls was at 87%. The only thing standing in the way of the will of the people is the Federal Navy! I have come here today to request that the Alliance of Independent Systems recognise the legitimacy of a free and democratic Lugh.\


* The Importance of Insurance
It's been said before, but it's worth saying again. Remember to set aside credits for your insurance excess.

Only recently Commander Gui returned home to Sol with his newly purchased Anaconda. Having equipped it with all the essentials he departed... straight in to an incoming Type 9. Without the 4 million credits to cover the excess for his ship, he was left with no choice but to resort to a budget Sidewinder. His loss for that one incident was 80 million credits.

Though many pilots can turn to creditors to cover some of the costs in case of emergency, 200 thousand credits is not enough to cover the cost of a truly premium vessel.

The moral of the story? Always check your rebuy costs in your systems screen before launching. Don't leave the space port without having the excess..

You've been warned commanders...

Commander Sheehy of the Reorte Chronicle


* Lambda Andromedae: Bringing Data Home
Inspired by Universal Cartographics recent push to expand humanities borders, the Sirius Corporation has today announced its plan to launch a number of new colonial outposts to the very edges of occupied space.

Ana Quin, Sirius' Junior Vice President of Interstellar Logistics, had this to say about the announcement:

\We're very excited to move forward with this project. It's been a long time coming, but finally the board have agreed it's time to get the ball rolling. We've got the tech and the volunteers, all we need now is to know where to send them.\

Sirius is currently offering sizeable monetary rewards for explorers who bring usable exploration data containing potential candidate sites to their offices aboard Nourse Orbital in Lambda Andromedae.


* Building a New Ship - BD+03 2338
Despite Admiral Vincent's strong words during yesterday's press conference, President Halsey has refused the Admiral's request to send additional forces for the attack on Polahukuna.

In response, the Federal Navy, in conjunction with Core Dynamics, has declared their intention to commission the creation of a new capitol ship. The new ship will be built in the recently recaptured shipyards of BD+03 2338, and the Admiral's personal contingent will remain in the locale in order to protect the construction of the new vessel.


* Lucan Onionhead Lives On in Tanmark
The Defence Force of Tanmark, in association with the Farmers Union of Kappa Fornacis, is pleased to announce the success of their initiative to increase the local production of Lucan Onionhead.

Over the last week hundreds of independently minded contractors delivered over 500,000 tons of land enrichment systems to Cassie-L-Peia. Specialist farmers from Kappa Fornacis were then able to stimulate the mass growth of Lucan Onionhead clones.

When asked for comment, President Halsey's office reiterated that Lucan Onionhead is illegal within all Federal jurisdictions and that anyone caught transporting, cultivating or otherwise selling the drug would be subject to prosecution.


* Duval Distributes Doctors in Furbaide
Aisling Duval made her presence felt in Furbaide today, as she arrived at Effinger Port to offer assistance to overworked medical staff currently caught in the struggle against the virulent and deadly Volungu Blight. Along with her usual entourage, the Diva Duval bought dozens of Imperially trained doctors and nurses, all of whom will be offering their services for free to anyone afflicted by the Blight.

It is hoped that the biomedical expertise provided by the Imperial doctors will shed some light on the genetic makeup of the disease, whose aggressive transmission and resistance to known drug therapies has local medical staff completely stumped.

The death toll for the disease is now reaching into the thousands, and with no cure in sight the situation can be expected to get worse before it gets better.


* Metal Madness Strikes in LAWD 26
The secret is out! There's a metal rush happening in LAWD 26, with thousands of entrepreneurs heading to the region in the hope of making their fortune before one of the big three mining corporations can establish a presence in the system.

News first broke about the newly discovered pristine mining site early last week, when a large quantity of raw gold was found aboard a Sidewinder that had been abandoned at Crook's Hub Starport in Toolfa. It turned out that the Sidewinder belonged to a Commander Hank Stone (deceased), a well known prospector who had struck it rich when he discovered the previously untapped source of metals.

Doubtless it won't be long before the corporations move in to strip mine the area, but until they do there are some serious credits to be made in LAWD 26 by anyone willing to work hard and get their hands dirty!


* Assassination Attempt as Lugh Rallies in Alioth Grow
Alioth played host to scenes of chaos today when \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghire addressed the crowds after his second attempt to gain an audience with Alliance representatives failed. While engaging with the huge numbers that had gathered to hear him speak, \u00c9amonn was targeted by a single shot that was fired from a nearby building.

The shot missed the ambassador, but killed a member of the crowd. The ambassador was rushed to safety as the crowd began to flee the scene in terror, causing enough chaos for the assailant to escape undetected.

U\u00ed Laoghire later returned to the steps outside the central council building to deliver his most defiant speech yet.

\We declare the right of the people of Lugh to the ownership of Lugh. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished that right, nor can it ever be extinguished, no matter how many murderers the Federation sends to try and silence us. »


* Containing the Contagion
Tensions have been running high aboard Effinger Port this week as doctors, nurses and scientists worked around the clock to find a cure for the Volungu Blight.

A breakthrough finally occurred on Wednesday night after medical staff supplied by Aisling Duval managed to identify the pathogen behind the Blight. Once that was done, doctors were able to develop a course of treatment to fully eradicate all traces of the disease from patients' bodies.

While the cure comes too late for the thousands of families in Volungu, Furbaide, Liaedin and LHS 3505 that lost loved ones over the last week, the news doubtlessly comes as quite a relief to the hundreds of thousands more who are currently waiting to receive the cure aboard their local stations.


* The Fight Against Falisci
There's war brewing in the Empire, as despite a stern warning issued in their direction by Senator Denton Patreus, the pirates of Falisci continue to plunder innocent traders as they pass through on the way to ply their wares in Dongzi and Ngaiawang.

Things could soon change however, as reports are coming in that warships belonging to the Citizens of Tradition, a group well known for their support of Senator Patreus, have been spotted amassing on the borders of Falisci.

When pressed for comment, Commander Shole of the Citizens of Tradition had this to say:

« We've got our orders. No traders are going under on our watch. If those Falisci scumbags so much as think about crossing this border, they're going to wish they hadn't. »

Imperial Commanders willing to join the fight to defend imperial space should seek out the Citizens of Tradition aboard Dornier Terminal in Ngaiawang.


* Core Dynamics Assist Federal Navy in BD+03 2338
Core Dynamics is pleased to declare the launch of a new stage in their partnership with the Federal Navy. While the exact terms of the agreement must remain secret for reasons of galactic security, GalNet can reveal that the joint cooperation effort will involve the construction of several new Capital Ships, the first of which has just started being built in the newly recaptured shipyards aboard Hudson Dock in BD+03 2338.

Rumours suggest that funding for this project is coming from an unidentified corporate super PAC, who is believed to be the same group that were previously involved in helping Shadow President Hudson gain office.

Pilots interested in helping with the construction of the new vessel should seek out Core Dynamics representatives aboard Hudson Dock to find out what materials the company's engineers are currently looking to source.


* GalNet Galactic Trade-Labour Report
An influx of semi-professional miners from Sol has caused a significant increase in the demand for Mineral Extractors in LAWD 26. In order to meet that demand, the Union of Toofla Progressive Party is currently offering excellent rates for all Mineral Extractors sold to Stone's Legacy. As if that wasn't generous enough, in order to attract new potential trading partners the Union of Toofla Progressive Party are also selling off large amounts of gold at bargain basement prices. Furthermore, the Union of Toofla Progressive Party has guaranteed that they will discount the price of locally sourced gold even further if they manage to secure their place as a major player in the local markets.

***

The Sirius Corporation released a statement today announcing that thanks to the tireless work of hundreds of explorers, 8 new colonisation candidate systems have now been identified. Sirius scientists hope to discover many more potential sites as they continue analysing the petabytes of data they've received over the last week. Explorers interested in helping with the Sirius Corporation's colonisation project only have a few hours left to make their submissions to Universal Cartographics on Nourse Orbital in Lambda Andromedae.

* * *

Despite heavy interference from pirates and imperial mercenaries, Core Dynamics are still looking to source a large supply of copper for use in the construction of the new Federal Capital Ship aboard Hudson Dock in BD+03 2338. It is believed that Core Dynamics have requested additional funding from the Federal Navy in order to hire private security to protect traders bringing copper into the system. At time of publication the funding had not yet been approved.


* GalNet Galactic War Report
The ongoing conflict between the Federal Navy and the Polahukuna Raiders has taken an unexpected turn this weekend, following reports that the Federation have begun work on a new Farragut class battlecruiser in the shipyards aboard Hudson Dock. For their part, the Polahukuna raiders appear to have returned home to lick their wounds. However, reports are coming in from BD+03 2338 that traders bringing supplies to Hudson Dock are coming under heavy fire from a band of imperial mercenaries known as the East India Company.The Imperial Senate is denying any knowledge of the attacks.

In imperial space, the Citizens of Tradition, acting under the authority of Senator Denton Patreus, have begun a full scale invasion of the Falisci system. The initiative to secure the spaceways around Dongzi and Ngaiawang against criminal activities is being led from Dornier Terminal in Ngaiawang.


* Unregulated Slaves Sought in Synteini
The Imperial Slavers Association, in conjunction with Senator Zemina Torval, is pleased to announce the official opening of the newest ISA slave training facility aboard Lagerkvist Gateway in the Synteini system.

The facility, which includes state of the art skill implantation terminals and body sculpting shops, is already set to become one of the premier Imperial Slave training academies anywhere in Imperial space.

Commander Barham of the Imperial Slavers Association had this to say about the new centre:

« It really is a marvel of modern technology. We have some of the best trainers, working with the very best materials that credits can buy. We have no doubt that this facility will stand as a shining example to the rest of the galaxy as to how to get your unregulated workforce up to an appropriately imperial standard. »


* A Distant Rendezvous \u2013 43,000 Light Years from Home
On the fringe of the Scutum-Centaurus arm, on the far side of the galaxy, two lone deep space explorers rendezvoused at a star system called EACTAINDS GN-W C1-6.

CMDR R4nger0's mission? To cross the galaxy in a Sidewinder.

CMDR Kamzel's mission? Returning to Earth after an 8-week survey expedition along the galactic outer rim.

CMDR Kamzel left the frontier on 16th December 3300, CMDR R4nger0 departed on 7th January 3301. The meeting was the first human contact both pilots had in the many weeks they'd been away from home. Both pilots jointly surveyed the rendezvous system, shared a bottle of Lavian Brandy, and parted ways to continue on their respective journeys. The event was recorded and a vlog data-packet was beamed back toward human space. Streams of the log can be viewed by searching for 'A Distant Rendezvous' via your local vlog service provider.

Some observers have called for the EACTAINDS GN-W C1-6 star system to be renamed 'Rendezvous Point', to commemorate this historic event... the most distant deep space encounter ever recorded.


* Sirius Exploration Survey Completes
The Sirius Corporation is pleased to announce that the reconnaissance portion of its latest colonisation project has now drawn to a close.

Hundreds of highly skilled scout ships took part in the survey, which managed to gather data on tens of thousands of potential candidate systems. Early indications suggest that at least several dozen potential target sites have been discovered, although that number is sure to drop as Sirius Corporation scientists, sociologists and logistics officers continue to pour over petabytes of data in order to identify the most promising candidates for colonisation.


* Lugh Ambassador Accuses Federal Party of Foul Play
Lugh   Ambassador \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghire, the leading spokesman for the Crimson State Group, held his third and final rally on Alioth today.

After a heated speech, in which he spared no quarter for the Federation and their mistreatment of the Lugh population (who he repeatedly referred to as 'The Sons of Conn'), U\u00ed Laoghire was met by a standing ovation from the massive crowds who had assembled to hear him speak.

\Our children are disappearing. In the past year alone we have seen the numbers rise to 25,431 individual cases. You will not get these figures from the Federation. Of course not! But make no mistake, they know what's happening. What are the Lugh for Equality Party really up to? They took our land and now they're trying to take our future. The Sons of Conn will take it no more! We demand complete separation from all Federal ties immediately! One people, one system under Lugh's glorious light! »


* Alliance Terraforming Initiative Set to Enter Final Stage
The Big G Corporation, in association with the Alliance of Independent Systems, is pleased to announce that a dozen planets involved in the Alliance terraforming programme are finally ready to undergo their last stage of biochemical transformation.

The first set of planets to undergo the final stage of terraforming includes:

Djaujas A 1 in Djaujas

Khona 3 in Khona

Dohkwithi A 1 in Dohkwithi

Hip 54692 3 in Hip 54692

Milelbis 4 in Milelbis

While the Big G Corp is expected to handle most of the terraforming process, using their patented and highly secretive World Blending Technology, independent contractors are being encouraged to visit with Big G representatives in order to take advantage of the various stock orders that the company is looking to fill.


* Internal Strife Strikes Tanmark
News is coming out of the Tanmark system of an ongoing conflict having broken out between the Defence Force of Tanmark and a local criminal gang known as the Tanmark Posse. The Tanmark Posse are reportedly the main driving force behind the recent cultivation of Lucan Onionhead in hidden facilities throughout Luca.

So far, fighting between the two factions has remained confined to the surface of Luca. Security forces are currently in the process of raiding all known Tanmark Posse holdings on the planet, which has caused all but the most loyal gang members to abandon the system in search of more hospitable surroundings.

A source close to the two groups, who has asked to remain anonymous for their own safety, informed GalNet that the fighting is a direct result of the Tanmark Posse misleading the Defence Force of Tanmark into believing that the cultivation of Onionhead on Luca would be a short term arrangement.

Now that it's become clear that Lucan Onionhead has been deliberately modified in order to stop it from being able to produce natural offspring,  the Defence Force of Tanmark are taking pre-emptive steps to ensure that Luca doesn't suffer the same fate as Panem.


* Falisci in Flames
Imperial forces have decimated the majority of the Falisci Purple Gang's fleet, just five days after the Citizens of Tradition declared war against the dreaded pirate crew and their allies. Now only a handful of the Purple Gang's most stalwart members remain to defend their territory against the Citizens of Tradition and the thousands of loyal citizens who have flocked to Falisci to fight by their side.

What little resistance the gang is still able to muster will almost certainly not be enough to keep the Citizens of Tradition from taking control of the system. However, reports are coming in from the region that the Federally aligned Social Falisci Partnership are currently attempting to bolster the Purple Gang's numbers in what is surely a futile attempt to stop Senator Patreus from taking control of the sector.


* Unity Starport Officially Opens in New Yembo
Today marks the official opening of the first Deep Space Exploration Platform being sponsored by the Explorers' Association in conjunction with Universal Cartographics. The station will initially be housed in New Yembo, a resource rich system on the outer edges of human-occupied space.

Thousands of Commanders helped provide the materials necessary to build this new state of the art Ocellus. The actual construction of the station took tens of thousands of workers just three weeks to complete, which in itself is a testament to the highly organised and methodical approach that the EAUC collaboration has applied to this project.

GalNet can also now exclusively reveal that after an impassioned round of debates between EA and UC committee members, the New Yembo starport has been given the name Unity in honour of the collaborative effort that made its creation possible.


* Torval Handles the Help in Synteini
Corporations operating under the direction of Senator Zemina Torval have been making waves throughout the Empire this week, as shipments of unregulated slaves continue to pour into Imperially -sanctioned slave training centres in Synteini.

Despite the questionable legal nature of the Senator's import operations, the Senate has so far elected to not address the issue at any officially held quorum.

Some political commentators have suggested that the lack of opposition is a clear sign of the Chancellor's waning power within the Senate, although sources close to the Chancellor have suggested that « Chancellor Blaine is simply too busy to deal with Zemina's frankly pathetic attempts to take advantage of the Emperor's current condition. »


* The War for Falisci
Senator Patreus and the Citizens of Tradition have been successful in their crusade against the Falisci Purple Gang. Falisci has fallen to Imperial forces and is currently in the process of being assimilated into Imperial society.

All outstanding payments due to Imperial veterans of the Falisci war are now available for collection from Dornier Terminal in Ngaiawang. To celebrate Senator Patreus's victory, Senator Torval is offering a 10% discount on all Imperial slaves purchased from Dornier Terminal until next weekend.

However, the war for control of Falisci may not quite be over yet. Reports have started to come in from the region that a civil war is currently brewing between the Citizens of Tradition and the Federal Social Falisci Partnership Party. If the Social Falisci Partnership Party is successful in its attempt to disrupt the Citizens of Tradition's hold over Phillips Landing, the Federation may be able to gain control over Falisci.


* Anti-Slavery Support Grows in Synteini System
The Future of Synteini party is calling on all Commanders to protest the actions of the Imperial Slavers Association in the Synteini system.

« Today marks the anniversary of the 'Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves', one of two acts that helped end the Atlantic slave trade in the early 19th century, » said a party representative. « And now a new slaving facility is opening up in our own backyard? »

The party offers their own station as a potential solution. « The Future of Synteini party will not abide by slavery, Imperial or no. I make the call to commanders: give your business to the Future of Synteini, not to the ISA. Do business at William Sargent, and starve Lagerkvist.

« Let's hit Senator Zemina Torval where it counts - and kick her out of Synteini! »

Lagerkvist Gateway orbits the second planet in the Synteini A system, while William Sargent Vision orbits the fourth.

* It's Time to Stop Slavery Stupid
Aisling Duval is in the spotlight again today, following a rather passionate outburst on the Empire's most-watched reality stream show, Celebrity Pets.

« The truth is every pet we've seen tonight lives a better life than the billions of slaves who are busy working themselves to death while all you viewers just sit there and laugh, » the youngest Duval said during the ever-popular 'Pimping Pets Get Pampered' segment.

« Just take that old bat Zemina. She's got a whole zoo on that fancy ship of hers. I mean it's not a good zoo, but I bet her pets get to eat well. Meat even. Her slaves are lucky if they get gruel.  Think they've ever got meat? Yeah, right. Slavery is stupid, and it is way past time we stopped it. »

In support of Aisling's anti-slavery rhetoric, Stop Slavery Stupid has announced it will once again be accepting Imperial slaves for emancipation and rehabilitation at centres aboard Mackenzie Relay in Cemiess, Thiele Orbital in Ngun and Naubakht City in Eta Horologii.


* Prism Senator will not be late, not even slightly
In another administrative mix up, Lady Kahina Tijani Loren's Imperial Courier has been denied docking clearance at Mars High. Official observers report that an Imperial Courier attempted to dock without prior permission and when confronted, refused to acknowledge hails.

Unofficial, and anonymous, reports from independent traders seem to favour the view that Mars High docking personnel routed Lady Kahina's ship to the back of the queue unnecessarily, and rather than comply, she positioned her ship directly in the docking entrance and refused to move it until granted a landing pad.

Lady Kahina was later quoted as saying. 'As I said before, I don't like to be late.'

Rumours that the docking clearance officer at Mars High has been encouraged to retire early are strenuously denied by Federal administrators.


* Pirates Prospering in Tanmark
Despite the Defence Force of Tanmark's overwhelming success in closing down the Tanmark Posse's operations on Luca, hundreds of unmarked pirate ships have been attacking innocent traders as they go about their business in the system.

It would appear that the recent wave of criminal activity has been sparked by the economic boom that the region has been experiencing, as a result of the increased production of Lucan Onionhead.

So far the Defence Force of Tanmark has only been allowing traders access to a very limited amount of Lucan Onionhead, a decision that they claim was made in an attempt to stop criminals from targeting individual traders on their way out of the system. That could all change, however, as the Defence Force of Tanmark is now offering to empty out its storerooms once security in the region has been restored.

Commanders interested in taking part in the security initiative should sign up for active duty aboard Cassie-L-Peia in Tanmark.


* Federal Congress Calls Emergency Session
An emergency special session of the Federal Congress was held today to discuss how best to deal with the Crimson State Group's attempt to force Lugh to secede from the Federation.

Lugh is home to 15.3 billion residents, who are supported almost entirely by the vast natural resources that Lugh has at its disposal.

In her address to Congress, President Halsey had this to say on the situation:

« Systems choosing to hold fair and democratic elections to determine whether they wish to remain within the Federal fold is one thing, but a group of religious fanatics petitioning a foreign power to help overthrow a democratically elected Federal government is another matter entirely. The Federation will not allow theocrats, terrorists or any other fringe organisation to usurp the right and proper rules that govern our society. If the Crimson State Group continues to go down this road then the Federation will respond with whatever force deemed necessary. »


* The Scars of War in Banki
The Federation may have won the war in the Banki system, but survivors on both sides are still in a struggle for survival.

After a long and bitter conflict, the Federation was able to clutch a victory (as well as a base) after offering greater incentives for Commanders willing to fight on their side. This strategy drew in throngs of Commanders from throughout the galaxy, tilting the scales decisively in favour of the Federal Navy.

At the end, the situation grew very grim for the Banki Gold Gang. Hundreds were killed, thousands were wounded, and medical supplies stretched perilously thin. Despite winning the war, the Federation now has to deal with a destitute populace, an outbreak and the threat of famine on the horizon.

The CEO of the Gold Advanced Partners and current governor of Banki, Christopher Kailson, has put out this passionate plea for help:

\Banki needs the support of Commanders now more than ever. Supplying even a small amount of Banki's needs will help to ease the suffering of the ill, the orphaned, and the poor. »

- CMDR John Paul Wilson


* Galactic Mechanics Union Busted Breaking Laws
Word has reached GalNet that an investigation into the Galactic Mechanics Union will result in charges being brought against the organisation by all three of the galaxy's major powers.

The investigation, which was carried out in secret by a consortium of independent investigators, has found that the GMU has been involved in anti-competitive business practices, including price fixing on a galactic scale.

Lawsuits are currently in the process of being submitted to the appropriate authorities. With millions of potential plaintiffs signing up to take part in what will doubtless be the largest class action case in history, it seems unlikely that the GMU will make it out of the courts still in one piece once this is all over.

While the lawsuits are likely to go on for years before anyone is able to claim any kind of compensation, ship repair costs should start becoming significantly cheaper now that the GMU's price fixing operations have come to an end.


* Lugh Prepares for War
Crimson State Group representatives who were still present on Alioth were forced to make a hasty departure earlier today, as reports of Federal checkpoints being established around local exit points began to hit the Alliance blogosphere.

It would appear that the Federation means to finally show its hand in what has been a long and arduous game of poker between the Federal goliath and a small but proud people willing to defy the domination of their oppressors.

In the wake of his unsuccessful attempts to reach a favourable conclusion with representatives of the Alliance, Ambassador \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghaire had this to say:

\Lugh is a sovereign state. This is an undeniable truth. An error does not become truth by multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it! Though the storm clouds gather around us, it has been written in our ancient 'Leabhar Gabh\u00e1la Lugh' that the Sons of Conn will come to Lugh's aid at his time of direst need. That also is a universal truth.\


* Alioth Warns Lugh They Stand Alone
Speaking before a gathering of the Alliance Assembly today, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has issued a warning to the Crimson State Group that it stands alone in its opposition to the Federation's continued governance of Lugh.

« It is not the place of the Alliance to intervene in matters of legitimate Federal governance. No laws have been broken, no rights have been abused and as such no military aid will be forthcoming for the freedom fighters of Lugh. Similarly, until such time as the residents of Lugh have fully seceded from the Federation, any applications to join the Alliance of Independent Systems will be automatically rejected on the grounds that Lugh is not a fully functioning independent state. »

The news will come as quite a blow for Lugh, and the Crimson State Group in particular, who will now need to find allies closer to home if they want to have any hope of winning their fight for independence.


* Federal Military Lobby for Tax Reduction on Private Pilots
Rumours coming out of Mars today suggest that a powerful lobbying group, acting on behalf of Admiral Vincent and the Federal Navy, are currently engaged in a massive campaign to lower taxes on combat-capable spacecraft. The aim of the campaign is to encourage Federal pilots to become more battle-ready in these times of heightened tensions.

If the lobbying efforts prove to be successful, the Imperial armament program will doubtless be forced to follow suit or else risk the Empire being undermined by the increased combat capabilities of the Federal Navy.


* Core Dynamics Completes Work on New Capital Ship
Core Dynamics, in association with the Federal Navy, are pleased to announce the latest addition to the Federal capital ship family, the FNS Nevermore.

Core Dynamics Farragut  -Class Battlecruisers represent the cutting edge in military technology. A single FCB can carry several squadrons of Federal Fighters and multiple Federal Corvettes across hundreds of light years without any difficulty. These deep deployment capabilities, coupled with extraordinarily heavy firepower, practically guarantee that a single FCB will completely overpower all but the most well-equipped opponents.

The construction of the new ship would not have been possible without the help of Commander Sam Ishum, who braved the blockade of BD+03 2338 to single-handedly deliver 86,000 tonnes of copper to the Core Dynamics workshop at Hudson Dock.

When asked for comment, Commander Ishum had this to say:

« As the sole proprietor of Toad's Independent Trading Services, I am happy to have helped with the building of the new Core Dynamics Dreadnought, the FNS Nevermore. I look forward to working with them on future projects.\

To celebrate the launch of the FNS Nevermore, Core Dynamics has supplied Hudson Dock with a large number of discounted Federal Dropships.


* Senator Steps Out with Socialite
Senator Patreus and Aisling Duval have been spotted together at a number of popular nightspots in Capitol this week, leading some social commentators to speculate that the two may have become romantically involved.

If true, the association could potentially secure Senator Patreus's bid to become the leading voice of the Empire. While Aisling herself is not currently considered a serious contender for the Imperial Throne, her pairing with the Senator could provide the leverage he needs to secure support from a large portion of the Senate, particularly from those who are currently throwing their weight behind Chancellor Blaine.

When asked for comment, both Senator Patreus and Aisling Duval refused to answer any questions regarding their possible relationship.


* Launching the Colonies
Almost a thousand years ago, a corporate colonisation project from Earth set out on a trip to find a new home among the stars. The colonists settled in the Sirius system, where they became one of the leading suppliers of drive fuel anywhere in the galaxy, and so the Sirius Corporation was born.

The Sirius Corporation has a long history of colonising worlds beyond the borders of occupied space, which is why the Sirius Corporation is pleased to announce that it will be returning to its roots with the launch of 9 new colonial outposts, all of which should start being deployed within the next 14 days.

The 9 systems chosen to act as new homes to Sirius Corporation colonists are:

The Wredguia Colony Cluster

Wredquia SX-L D7-92

Wredguia SX-L d7-91

Wredguia WD-K D8-66

Wredguia QA-N b34-4

Wredguia XD-K d8-78

Sirius Outposts

Gliese 97.2

HIP 8396

Col 285 Sector WA-L b9-3

CAO Junga


* Patreus Calls on Blaine to Release Emperor's Medical Records
In an address delivered to the Imperial Senate earlier today, Senator Denton Patreus has called on Chancellor Blaine to provide the Senate with full access to the ailing Emperor's medical records.

« The current situation is untenable, » the Senator said. « How long are we expected to simply accept that Emperor Hengist is on the road to recovery? It's been months now and there's been no sign of the Emperor making a recovery of any kind. For the sake of the entire Empire, we need to know whether or not Emperor Hengist is ever going to be able to reclaim the throne. If Emperor Hengist really is getting better, then Chancellor Blaine should release the Emperor's medical records to show the Senate that there is nothing to worry about. If not, we need to establish what needs to be done to secure our citizens' future. »


* Full Scale Attack on Polahukuna Postponed
Following the declaration of war by President Halsey earlier today, the Federal Navy's attack on Polahukuna has been postponed indefinitely. Instead the newly built Capital Ship  , the FNS Nevermore, will be diverted to help with the offensive against Lugh.

Unfortunately, due to the actions of Operation Arm Chop , the FNS Nevermore is not yet equipped with a full contingent of fighters. As a result, the FNS Nevermore will not be able to set off for Lugh until the construction of its personal fleet is complete.

Core Dynamics estimate that it will be another six or seven days before the FNS Nevermore will be able to join Federal forces in their attack on Lugh, until which time it will remain safely harboured in Hudson Dock.


* The War for Lugh
President Halsey has today officially declared war on the Crimson State Group.

Ownership of Lugh has been hotly contested in recent months. The movement for an independent Lugh, led by the Crimson State Group, had managed to achieve a staggering 91% approval rating among the local populace. However, the figures are heavily disputed by the Lugh for Equality Party, which has recently released statistics claiming that less than 30% of the population are actively engaging in the political process.

GalNet sources close to the President have suggested that the upcoming attack will be launched from within Lugh itself. Loyal Federal pilots who want to assist with the reclamation of Lugh should sign up for active duty aboard Hartsfield Market, although Federal mercenaries are advised that it may be several days before backup arrives.

In response to the declaration of war, \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghaire has declared that the Crimson State Group will be offering very generous payouts to any independent pilots who choose to side with Lugh in the upcoming conflict against the Federation. Mercenaries interested in taking the Crimson State Group up on its offer should sign up for active duty aboard Balandin Gateway.


* Blaine Refuses Patreus's Request
Chancellor Blaine made a rare appearance at today's Senate meeting in order to address remarks made earlier in the week by Senator Denton Patreus.

« It is with regret that I must deny the honourable Senator's request to access the Emperor's medical records. As has always been the case, for reasons of national security his Majesty's medical records are only accessible by the Emperor's personal physicians. Should his Majesty's condition change in any way, for better or for worse, I will make sure to inform the Senate as soon as possible. Until such an event comes to pass, I will continue to act in the Emperor's stead, according to his will. As for the question of succession, that will be addressed when the situation calls for it and not before. »


* Imperial Pageant for Prism Senator
In an apparent show of solidarity for the visiting Senator and in protest at her perceived shabby treatment at the hands of her Federation hosts, dozens of independent Commanders have volunteered to escort Lady Kahina Tijani Loren's Imperial Courier through Federal space for the duration of her trip.

The unofficial escort is primarily composed of Imperial Cutters in private ownership, causing acute embarrassment to the Federation, who are powerless to prevent newsfeed images of what appears to be a sizeable Imperial fleet gallivanting unchallenged against the unmistakeable backdrop of core Federation worlds.

Lady Kahina was briefly interviewed by The Mars Herald and was asked, \What do you think of your welcome into Federal space?\

She replied with \When I receive one, I shall let you know.\


* Hudson Questions Halsey's Motives
Shadow President Hudson has released a scathing attack on the President's offensive against the Crimson State Group, calling it « nothing more than a petty attempt to show strength at the cost of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives ».

He went on to say:

« The fact that our troops are doing well in Lugh is a testament to the excellent training programmes offered by the Federal Navy. It is certainly no thanks to the actions of our supposedly esteemed President, who sent our troops off to war without adequate support or supplies. Indeed, if anyone should take credit for the current success of the Federation's strike teams, it is the loyal Federal pilots who flew in from all over the galaxy to answer the President's premature call to wage war against our own people. »


* The Lugh Report
The fighting has been fierce in the Lugh system this past weekend. Hundreds of thousands of ships have been shot down and millions have lost their lives in the opening salvo of the war.

Federal pilots are currently dominating the skies of Lugh, where they outnumber the native Crimson State Group 2 to 1. The Crimson State defences are in particularly bad shape, with reporters on the ground claiming that we are just days away from the first CSG outpost falling to the Federal Navy.

However, reports are coming in that spies loyal to the Crimson State Group are currently working to seriously undermine the Lugh for Equality Party on their home station of Hartsfield Market. If the undercover operatives succeed at their task before the Federation manages to stamp them out, the Crimson State Group could snatch Hartsfield Market (and control of the system) from out of the Federation's grasp.


* Prism Senator Continues to Woo Federation Residents
Lady Kahina Tijani Loren's unofficial entourage has begun a tour of the outer gas giants in the Sol system. Hundreds of privately owned Federation-registered vessels have turned out to greet the Senator, in lieu of an official welcome, as she continues her passage through the Sol system despite continued apathy from officials.

Requests for interviews from the diplomatic representatives on Mars have been turned down, but one, rather stressed, aide was quoted as saying, \Listen. We have no intention of jumping through hoops for some jumped-up Imperial prima donna who won't do the paperwork properly. That's off the record, yes?\

Questioned on this at a Merchants Guild reception hosted on Titan, Lady Kahina was quoted as saying, \We Imperials often do get accused of being arrogant and overbearing, but at least we're good at it.\


* Rebels Declare War on the Federation in 78 Ursae Majoris
The system of 78 Ursae Majoris, home to over 10 billion people, has erupted into civil war today. The conflict started just hours after news broke that the frontier system was planning to announce its intention to secede from the Federation.

We spoke to local resident and farmer, Gryph Jones, who woke up this morning to find he now lives near one of the heaviest focal points of the conflict. He had this to say on the matter:

\Pah! The Federation! Now, I won't say I support this war, the revolutionaries are monsters and criminals, but the inability of the local Federal government to keep things under control is exactly why those folks are so unpopular here! The Feds are too busy playing with Lughnatics and Onionheads half a galaxy to focus on places like this - maybe both sides will kill each other off, I can't help but think we'd be better off for it. »


* The True North Star
In a brief written statement submitted to GalNet news, Virgil Kyle, commander of the exploration-fitted Asp Spirit of Indianapolis, claims to have been the first to visit what he calls Sol's 'true North Star'.

\Wregoe TV-L C24-0 is over 1,200 light-years 'north' of Sol's position in the galactic plane, and less than a light-year from her position otherwise,\ he goes on to explain. \Due to the jump distances involved, the system is only visitable by Asps and Anacondas fitted to achieve near-maximum jump ranges.\

\I know it ain't the flashiest achievement,\ he admits, \And other explorers have obviously achieved far greater things, but as the star system hadn't yet been visited, I thought it was worth mentioning.\

He finished his statement with an invitation to other explorers and sightseers in suitably equipped vessels to visit the area, calling the view of the Milky Way from the system 'spectacular'.


* Onionhead Returns to Kappa Fornacis
The Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union appears to be up to its old tricks again, as news has started to come out of the region that Onionhead is once again available in the ports around Panem.

« We aren't going to be kept down by the man, man, » Georgio Algeria announced to the gathered crowds in the marketplace aboard Harvestport. « You can't stop the crop. It's always out there, man. That's nature, that's just how it works. The people know what they want, and what they want is 100% organic, original blend Onionhead. »

When asked for comment, President Halsey's office said that the matter would be dealt with in due course.


* The Nevermore Not Ready for Duty
Core Dynamics has been put in the deeply embarrassing position of having to further postpone the maiden voyage of the FNS Nevermore. Representatives of Core Dynamics have confirmed that this most recent delay is due to faulty sensor and turret targeting arrays.

The faults first came to light when engineers began running the FNS Nevermore through its standard weapon diagnostic checks late last week. According to Core Dynamics, the FNS Nevermore's weapon systems gave engineers the all clear, but upon attempting to fire on the target drone ship, the FNS Nevermore instead released a massive volley into Hudson Dock.

The dock's defence systems then returned fire, causing the Nevermore's automated battle systems to kick in, resulting in an all-out fight between the two stellar titans.

It took engineers three hours to regain control of the ship. During this time dozens of people were killed, and hundreds of millions of credits in damages were done to both structures.

Commander Lokquine, a member of Hudson Dock's Shipyard Union, had this to say on the matter:

« Well honestly, what do you expect to happen when you build a ship like that out of so much Copper? I told them they should have used Gold, cheap << censored >>. »

Core Dynamics is now looking for traders to help bring a variety of Metals to Hudson Dock to assist in the repair efforts.


* The Union of Eta Draconis Falls to Force
Inside sources report that a covert raid, carried out by special operation forces acting on behalf of the Gold Vision Company, has led to the capture of Swift Terminal in Eta Draconis.

According to eye witness accounts, a small team of silent sidewinders managed to penetrate select points of the starport. Special operatives then manoeuvred towards, and captured, the main control terminal. They then shut down all power to the docking bays, allowing the main assault force unrestricted access to the port.

When asked for comment, President Vondell of the Gold Vision Company had this to say:

« We here at Gold Vision are proud of our soldiers who were fighting on the front-lines aboard Swift Terminal and on the surface of B5. I want to give a big thank you to my right hand men and women, the 8th Dragon Squadron. Without them fighting in the black, risking their lives every second, this would have never been possible. This is a new day for us, but rest assured we wish for nothing more than to bring peace and prosperity to the people of Eta Draconis. »


* Prism Senator in Illegal Parking Row
Returning to Earth at the invitation of the Secretary General, Senator Kahina Tijani Loren's Imperial Courier was tagged with a fine at Mars High apparently due to activating its boosters while still within the station.

Reports indicate this caused a deafening roar within the docking area and even cracked the windows of the docking administration office.

Sources close to Mars High administration were quoted as saying « We are showing restraint! She's lucky we didn't obliterate her ship immediately like most parking offenders. What else does she want? »

Deano Blake, a trader whose Adder has been impounded by Mars officials for several weeks due to an inadequately sealed drive plate, told our reporters, « Never really thought much of Imperials before this, but I've got hand it to this Kahina gal, she's got style! »


* Halsey Honours Heroes
Despite the actions of undercover operatives acting on behalf of the Crimson State Group aboard Hartsfield Market, the Federation continues to dominate the skies of Lugh.

Today President Halsey honours those heroes who have made the greatest contribution to the war effort.

Among them:

Lugh's top gun, Commander Nightwulf, who has managed to singlehandedly remove almost 14,000 enemy combatants from the field of battle.

Khaka's top logistics officer, Commander Darius Torkalar, who has personally shipped in 3000 tonnes of weapons into the area.

They have been heavily aided in their efforts by:

Post Commander Crownan

Post Commander Pablo-Diablo

Petty Officer Dave Lukewski III

As well as:

The Broker known as Commander BadBjarne

The Broker known as Commander Ranmust

The Merchant known as Commander Vorian Artreides


* Patreus and the Princess
Senator Patreus and Aisling Duval have been spotted out and about on Faece this weekend. The Empire's newest power couple took to the fashion halls for a pleasant afternoon shopping spree, accompanied by a vast entourage of followers and hangers-on.

The couple walked hand in hand as security cleared the way for them to enter shops and purchase beverages. The pair spent around three hours perusing the goods on offer in the Faece fashion halls, before retiring to Senator Patreus's ship for a light dinner.


* Eyes on Lugh
Federal forces continue to dominate the skies of Lugh. The Crimson State Group's air defences have been all but shredded, with the majority of their fleet now adopting a defensive position around Balandin Gateway and Knight Dock.

Thanks to the actions of a crack troop of Federal Marines, Seega Port was secured with only a handful of soldiers being lost in the process. Federation forces are now working hard to secure Read Gateway for use as a staging post, from which they plan to launch a series of attacks against Crimson State starports.

Despite millions of lives having already been lost in the conflict, rumours from Lugh suggest that the Crimson State Group is preparing a desperate last-minute attempt to stop the Federation from crushing the native uprising.

However, in a sign that the local population may be losing faith in the CSG's ability to secure the system, hundreds of refugee ships have started to flee from Lugh 6 in a bid to escape the Federation's wrath.


* Faith in President Falling
Recent popularity polls have scored the President at a shockingly low 26% approval rating, with 43% of those questioned stating that they strongly disapprove of the President's current policy decisions.

Doubtless the latest developments in the war for Lugh are sure to be of huge concern for President Halsey. Not only has her mismanagement of the war caused the death of countless innocent Federal civilians, many of whom died as a direct result of orders given by the President, but it also now seems certain that Hartsfield Market will fall to the rebel forces.

The Federation's failure to protect Hartsfield is being blamed on a lack of equipment, a shortage caused in no small part by the President's failure to ensure the appropriate supply chains were set up prior to launching an attack on Lugh's airspace.

If something isn't done to rectify the President's mistakes soon, the Crimson State Group will capture Hartsfield and with it control of Lugh's satellite defence system.


* President Orders Strike on Federal Refugees
Disaster struck in Lugh today, following orders given by President Halsey demanding that Federal pilots attack and destroy an unarmed refugee convoy as it fled from the fighting around Lugh 6. It is estimated that 9,322 innocent Federal civilians lost their lives in the attack.

The President claims that she was presented with evidence by the Joint Intelligence Committee which confirmed that \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghire, leader of the Crimson State Group, would be aboard one of the transports with his entourage.

However, sources close to the Crimson State Group claim that reports of \u00c9amonn's presence on the refugee ships were nothing more than fabrications.

Shadow President Hudson has sworn that an official investigation into the matter will be launched once the current crisis is over.


* Late Night Session Held Over Lugh Escalation
The debate in Congress turned ugly tonight, as members of both parties grilled the President over her mishandling of the Federation's interests during the last six months.

Particularly hot topics included the heavy-handed ban against Onionhead, the resultant bombing of Panem, the loss of multiple frontier systems to pirates and apathy, as well as her most recent blunders in the handling of the attack on Lugh.

Shadow President Hudson went so far as to remark:

« The Federal Navy handed you victory in Lugh on a silver platter, and how do you thank them? You murder thousands of our own people! The incompetence has to stop and it has to stop now! »


* The Battle for Hartsfield
In what can only be described as a devastating blow for the Federation, the Crimson State Group and the Sons of Conn have managed to wrestle control of Hartsfield Market from the Lugh for Equality Party.

The fighting in the halls of Hartsfield was particularly bloody, with tens of thousands having been killed on both sides of the conflict. Federal forces managed to hold the bridge for almost 78 hours after the rest of the station fell, but the Sons of Conn were eventually able to break through the Federation's defences to claim their prize.

Reports coming in from Hartsfield Market suggest that the Crimson State Group is currently in the process of accessing the station's command protocols. They are expected to be in full control of the station shortly.

Hartsfield Market is home to the master controls of Lugh's military defence network, ownership of which will allow the Crimson State Group to exert their influence across the entire system.


* Demand for Original Onionhead Higher Than Ever
Thousands of traders have started flocking back to Kappa Fornacis following the announcement that Onionhead is once again available for sale onboard Harvestport.

Demand for the original strain of Onionhead has remained high over the last few months, despite (or perhaps due to) the Federation's attempts to completely wipe the plant from the face of the galaxy. Street prices for the totally organic narcotic had skyrocketed by several hundred per cent, although the price is expected to level out again now that a new supply has become readily available.

For now the Onionhead trade on Kappa Fornacis is being allowed to continue unabated, but once the war in Lugh is over, the Federation is sure to turn its attention back to the farmers of Panem.


* Navy Withdraws from Lugh \u2013 Fighting Continues
Following last night's special session, Congress has decided to temporarily pull the Federal Navy from active duty in Lugh. Navy vessels are currently in the process of being diverted to Qureshi Enterprise in Khaka, where they will remain until such time as Congress decides on how to best end the current conflict.

Despite the official withdrawal of the Federal Navy, Lugh continues to find itself embroiled in an ongoing civil war between the Crimson State Group and the Lugh for Equality Party. The outcome of which is still far from certain.

 So far on the Federal side, Lugh for Equality has managed to gain control over the skies of Lugh. On the other side of the war, the native Crimson State Group has managed to take a significant advantage in terms of acquiring armaments for their ground troops.

The Federal forces need more guns, while the CSG need more dedicated combat pilots. With millions of residents having already lost their lives in the fight for an independent Lugh, it seems that neither group will give up the fight without a decisive outcome.


* The War for Lugh: A Temporary Peace
The strike against Federal civilians by the Federal Navy, coupled with the capture of Hartsfield Market a few hours later, caused mass confusion and disenchantment among Federal pilots operating in the area. Mercenaries who had previously fought for the Federation began defecting en masse, bolstering CSG forces to the point where they almost equalled the Federal forces in size.

As a result of having gained control of Lugh's satellite defence system during the capture of Hartsfield Market, the Crimson State Group managed to force the retreat of the Federal battlecruiser from its position around Lugh 11. Then, with the help of thousands of mercenary defectors, the Crimson State was able to re-establish control over the majority of Lugh's airspace.

For now the Federal Navy has retreated to fallback positions in Khaka and other local systems. Reports from Lugh suggest that the Lugh for Equality Party has established a ceasefire with the Crimson State Group, as both parties attempt to agree on what course of action would be best for the people of Lugh.

The system is still rife with unrest. The war has caused the local populace to resent both the Crimson State Group and the Federal Congress. Although the CSG has managed to establish their dominance over the system, whether they can keep it in the face of internal and external opposition still remains to be seen.


* The War for Lugh: The Turning Point
The turning point in the war came during the Federation's attack on Read Gateway.

Cormac U\u00ed Laoghire led the defence of the outpost personally, and after several days of fierce fighting, the Crimson State Group finally managed to achieve their first victory by successfully defending Read Gateway.

However, the reality is that it was more a failure on President Halsey's part than a victory on behalf of Crimson State. The defence only succeeded due to the Federation running dangerously low on weapons for their troops.

As soon as it became apparent that the Federation was having difficulty acquiring the weapons they needed to end the war, the Crimson State Group took advantage of the military intelligence obtained during Operation Dullahan to attack Hartsfield Market.

The battle for Hartsfield Market lasted for almost 5 days, during which time the Federation managed to establish complete dominance over the skies of Lugh. Unfortunately for President Halsey, air superiority alone was not enough to win the war, a fact she soon learned when the CSG tricked her into ordering a strike against Federal refugees attempting to flee the conflict.


* The War for Lugh: Federal Domination
The past fortnight has seen a devastating war rage through the once peaceful nation of Lugh.

The Crimson State Group, led by \u00c9amonn U\u00ed Laoghire, has long sought to establish Lugh as an independent system. However, it wasn't until \u00c9amonn attempted to gain support from Alliance officials that things began to get violent.

Fearful that yet another rich, powerful system would soon leave the Federal fold, President Jasmina Halsey ordered the Federal Navy to suppress the populist uprising. Thousands of Federal pilots flocked to obey the President's command, and in the early stages of the war, the Federation dominated the skies of Lugh. Countless Sons (and daughters) of Conn lost their lives in an attempt to stop the Federal Navy from simply crushing the rebel forces.

Their sacrifice bought time for the Crimson State Group to come up with a plan. As the Federation continued to rampage its way through the system, members of the Dukes of Mikunn, Emperor's Grace and the East India Company engaged in guerrilla tactics to keep the Federation's attention away from the work being carried out by the main CSG strike force.

Splitting their forces in two, the Crimson State Group focused on obtaining enemy intelligence and collecting weapons for their ground troops. All the while, they made sure to deliberately avoid engaging in open conflict with the vast Federal fleet.

Despite the valiant efforts of the CSG allied fleet, the Federation managed to tear through the Crimson State's air defences, exposing the CSG-controlled outposts to a series of attacks by Federal marines. The Federation looked unstoppable as they stormed through Seega Port unchecked.


* NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan Black Prototypes Revealed
The NVIDIA labs, in association with Reynhardt IntelliSys, are pleased to announce that prototypes of the GeForce GTX Titan Black graphics card are now available for purchase from one exclusive outlet.

A masterpiece of engineering, the NVIDIA Geforce GTX Titan Black represents the cutting edge of display technology. It balances a sleek design with uncompromising performance and unparalleled processing power, making the Titan Black one of the most desirable display modules in the entire galaxy. To celebrate the pre-release of the new module, NVIDIA are offering 5 lucky pilots the opportunity to win a commercial grade GTX Titan Black. Winning the competition couldn't be simpler*.

The first 5 pilots to sell a canister of NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan Black Prototypes back to NVIDIA HQ aboard Godel Ring will be rewarded with a commercial model as soon as they become available. The only problem is NVIDIA isn't saying where the prototypes are being sold.

Happy hunting Commanders.

*Entrants must have transported the prototypes under the Pilots Federation rules of 'open play' to be eligible to win.


* Unknown Explorer Returns From NGC 3199 Nebula
In a press release submitted to GalNet news, Commander Swift Arrow is announcing his recent return from the NGC 3199 Nebula. Swift Arrow is claiming to be the first explorer to fully map out the entire NGC 3199 Sector, and the 2nd explorer to visit the nebula (the 1st was Commander Celmascant). According to the data turned in to Universal Cartographics, all but 5 of the 750 systems in the NGC 3199 Sector have been fully scanned for the first time by Swift Arrow.

The 35,000 light year journey started with an excursion to the Butterfly Nebula before heading to NGC 3199 and finally back to civilized space, a trip lasting approximately 5 weeks. Representatives from the Sirius Corporation, Patron's Principles, Chapter of Isinor, the Alioth Independents and the Sublime Order of Van Maanen's Star have expressed great interest Swift Arrow's findings. The data was sold piece meal to each organization, who made various bids ranging from 7.1 to 11.2 million credits for specific high value systems. However, the largest bidder by far was the Patron's Principles, who paid a whopping 37.3 million credits for a lion's share of the data. The total value of the exploration data was just shy of 71 million credits.

Swift Arrow has issued a statement saying that he intends to release a guide to the NGC 3199 sector shortly in order to aid future explorers in further research of the area, including a short list of recommended points of interest and systems to avoid.


* Falisci: Democracy Denied
In recent weeks the tiny system of Falisci has become a hotbed of activity.

First came the war against the Falisci Purple Gang, which saw Senator Patreus and the Citizens of Tradition dominate the region with their superior firepower and overwhelming numbers. By the end of the week long struggle, the Falisci Purple Gang's leadership was in chains, and its members sold off to work as Imperial Slaves.

Then the Social Falisci Party, backed by a coalition of Federal squadrons, began attempting to exert their influence over the system. Imperial pilots fought back until it became clear that the Federation had grown tired of its futile attempts to overthrow the rightful rulers of the region.

The region may be devastated and its people may be in chains, but the Emperor's peace has finally come to Falisci.


* Alliance Shines Light on Prism Senator
In an open letter addressed for the attention of Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, Alliance representatives from Alioth have extended an invitation for her to visit their star-systems with the assurance the her trip will be free from « bungling bureaucracy, petty-minded procrastinators and deranged docking debacles. »

Apparently Lady Kahina's visit was placed on the agenda at a recent diplomatic exchange between the Alliance and the Federation with assurances sought by Alliance representatives that « somebody competent would be checking the paperwork in detail, and if at all possible, that landing pads could be reserved in advance. »

Lady Kahina is currently being entertained on Earth, where she was greeted by enthusiastically cheering crowds on arrival at the historic Cambridge spaceport before being taken to London to be met by Ambassador Waite.

The Mail on Mars even commented that « We should have more Senators drop in for visit, she's done more for Imperial Federation relations in a month than all those ambassadors have done in decades. »


* Explorers Needed for Alliance Colonisation Programme
Beyond the borders of occupied human space, the vast mysteries of the universe are waiting to be discovered. The last thousand years of human history have been shaped by our combined ability to travel through the stars in search of a better future.

Yet what has humanity done with this precious gift? The same thing we've always done. We wasted it.

Greed and war run rampant throughout the galaxy, and the concept of freedom has become nothing more than a buzzword spewed by people who have never known it.

The Alliance knows there's a better way, but to prove it they need YOUR help.

For the next two weeks, the Alliance of Independent Systems will be collecting exploration data for an exciting new colonisation initiative due to launch later this year.

Commanders interested in working with the Alliance should deliver any information they've uncovered in relation to potential colony sites to Purple Power Interstellar aboard Ziemkiewicz Ring in Tsu.


* Hudson Attacks President's History
Shadow President Hudson held a press conference on Mars earlier today to address rumours that he would be seeking support to oust President Halsey from office.

« President Halsey has proven time and time again that she is completely unfit for office. She complains about our youth wasting away in legally sanctioned virtual realities, and then off the back of shaky intelligence reports, orders the death of thousands of innocent Federal civilians trying to escape a nightmarish reality of her own making. »

« We need a commander-in-chief who understands the galaxy we live in. A leader who can make the Federation the shining beacon it was always destined to be. A president we can trust to do the right thing. »

« So to answer the question you've all been asking. Yes. I will be seeking support from Congress to remove President Halsey from power. How many more disasters can she be allowed to lead us through? As far I'm concerned, her removal can't come fast enough. »


* Aisling Calls Out Zemina
Aisling Duval was in the spotlight again last night, as the diva Duval took to the streams on the popular Imperial talk show, 'A Fireside Chat with Serena'.

Aisling started the show with some high praise for her 'Angels' , who have been working hard to remove all unruly elements on Cemiess.

« What they've done, it's just so uplifting, you know. To know that I, like, inspire people like that. It's just really great, y'know. Especially when certain people, certain ancient, misguided, possibly evil people think that what you're doing is stupid. It's not stupid. It's slavery that's stupid, Serena. Everyone knows that. »

When asked if she was referring to Senator Torval, Aisling simply laughed and said:

« Oh Serena, I thought we were talking about important things, not some old has-been. My Angels would wipe the floor with her Slavers any day of the week. I know deep down our citizens want to do the right thing. »


* Patreus Demands Debt from Themiscrya
The small system of Themiscrya has found itself embroiled in a row with Imperial Senator Denton Patreus. According to sources close to the situation, last year the Nationals of Themiscrya borrowed heavily from Senator Patreus in order to initiate regime change in Themiscrya. Now the Senator has called in the debt, and the Nationals of Themiscrya find themselves in the unfortunate position of being unable to make good on their obligations.

Since taking over the government of Themiscrya last June, the Nationals of Themiscrya have instituted a number of policies designed to help stabilise the previously volatile region. One such policy included heavily fortifying both their headquarters on Lily May and Themiscrya's satellite defence system aboard Bamford Station. Unfortunately, the defence system was sold to Themiscrya by representatives of Senator Patreus in the first place. Whether or not Patreus has remote access to the satellite defence system remains to be seen.

Senator Patreus has offered the Nationals of Themiscrya a 7-day grace period in which to come to terms with the Senator's finance team. If an agreement cannot be reached, Senator Patreus has indicated that he will be sending bailiffs to reclaim his property.


* Naylor Pledges Support of Halsey
After Shadow President Hudson's scathing attack on President Halsey earlier this morning, Vice President Naylor has sworn to continue his support of President Halsey.

« The President has had to make some hard decisions. Is she always right? That's not for me to say. What I can say is that if I were in her shoes, having to make decisions based on the same information, I would have almost certainly made the same decisions. »

« Loss of life is always regrettable, as is the loss of any member states from our great galactic Federation. However, none of that justifies the vitriol displayed by Shadow President Hudson earlier today. »

« We all know Hudson is desperate to get into office, but in the Federation it is the people who choose their leader, and they didn't choose him. They chose Jasmina Halsey to serve as President, and until the people say otherwise, it is President Halsey I follow. »


* Imperial Assassination Attempt Foiled
According to sources within the Imperial Palace on Capitol an attempt to end the Emperor's life was foiled late last night.

The close call came after a member of the Palace's janitorial team alerted the Emperor's personal physician to the fact that the Palace pharmacy had been left unlocked. This caused medical staff to carry out a full inventory of the Emperor's medical supplies, which in turn revealed evidence that some of the Emperor's medication had been tampered with.

Details as to the exact nature of the attack have not been shared with the press at this time. However, Chancellor Blaine's office has confirmed that had the attack gone undetected for much longer the Emperor would almost certainly have been killed.

The investigation into the matter is an ongoing concern. Citizens who think they may have information pertinent to the case should contact Capitol Security as soon as possible.


* Aisling's Angels Challenge the Senator's Slavers
The fortunes of societies least fortunate may finally be changing this week, as Senator Torval has accepted a challenge to go head to head with the Diva Duval to prove once and for all whose position the citizens of the Empire truly support.

Senator Torval and the Imperial Society will be buying up all the unregulated Slaves they can get their hands on at Lagerkvist Gateway in Synteini.

Aisling Duval, in association with Stop Slavery Stupid and the Empire Party, will be accepting donations of Imperial Slaves (with the express intention of setting them free) at Mackenzie Relay in Cemiess.

If Aisling wins, Senator Torval has sworn to set free any Slaves brought to her training centres during the course of the wager.

If Senator Torval wins, Aisling has agreed to take on a personal contingent of Imperial Slaves for no less than one year.

Citizens can show their support by signing up to deliver Slaves or Imperial Slaves to the candidate of their choice at the stations mentioned above.


* Operation Tomahawk Aims to Rid Lave of CODE Threat
As the war in Lave continues between CODE and Cosmic State, reports have emerged to suggest that Cosmic State have chosen Adle's Armada as unlikely allies in what's being called Operation Tomahawk.

The accusation is that CODE are charging traders and others passers-by for \travel passes\ in the Lave system, which are valid only for a set period, and will provide protection against CODE attacks.

These reports would seem to indicate that no visitor to Lave is safe unless a travel pass has been purchased from CODE. It is not clear at this stage what the Alliance reaction is to this policy, but it seems that as long as the funds aren't being channelled into the Lavian economy, they are unlikely to take a high view of this practice.

Galnet reached out to both CODE and Cosmic State for comment, and although no word has been received from CODE, Cosmic State asserted that CMDRs Silk and Kudach were heading Operation Tomahawk, aiming to free Lave, and now potentially Leesti also, from the perceived CODE threat.


* A Light in the Dark
Since Princess Arissa's impassioned speech on the steps of the Imperial palace yesterday evening, Citizens the length and breadth of the Empire have been speculating as to which group (or groups) prompted the princess to take such a public stand against them.

Despite rumours suggesting that the speech was intended as a warning to Senators Torval and Patreus, both of whom have flouted Imperial law on multiple occasions, GalNet can now exclusively reveal that the Princess was in fact talking about the unknown assailant responsible for the attack on the Emperor.

In a further statement released to GalNet this morning, the Princess had this to say:

« I will not sit idly by while unseen assailants strike at the very heart of our nation. The time for action is now, and I call on all loyal Imperial citizens to join me in my mission to purge the Empire of all those who wish to see it harmed. »

« For the next 7 days my agents on Simpson Depot in Facece will be empowering citizens to act on my behalf in the fight against Imperial corruption. I urge all loyal residents of the Empire to join me in hunting down the fiends who attacked our father at his weakest. Your compliance will be rewarded. »


* Investigation into Assassination Attempt Ongoing
Chancellor Blaine made an appearance before the Senate today to answer questions regarding the recent assassination attempt on the Emperor's life. The Chancellor remained stoic as he once again turned aside calls to clarify the line of succession, saying:

\I have been assured that the attempted attack on our beloved Emperor has not had any overly adverse effects on his health. The would be assassin has undone much of the good work that had been made towards his majesty's recovery. Yet the Emperor still lives. In time, I am confident he will be with us again.\

\Thanks to the tireless efforts of agents working on behalf of Princess Arissa, the assassin has been captured and is currently undergoing questioning. We don't expect to learn anything useful from the tool herself, but security forensic techs are analysing everything about the traitor's life as we speak. Have no doubt. We will find who ordered the attack, and we will bring them to justice.\


* Prism Senator Returns to Empire
After completing her tour of the Sol system and meeting several high ranking officials within the Federation, Senator Kahina Tijani Loren has returned to the Empire.

As expected a large flotilla of vessels accompanied Lady Kahina to the boundary of Federation influence, where she rendezvoused with the Imperial Interdictor Lucius.

The Sol Herald asked Lady Kahina what she had thought of her first trip to Sol. She was reported as saying that she had found it « Most enlightening » and wanted to express her thanks to all who had helped her « navigate the fiendishly complicated Federation protocols. »

Lady Kahina was then asked « Do you consider the docking officials at Mars High to be friends or rivals? »

Her reply was greeted with laughter over wide-band comms. « Oh, that's easy. Neither. »

Representatives from Mars High could not be reached for comment.


* Prism Senator in Illegal Smuggling Sting?
More scandal accompanied Senator Kahina Tijani Loren's continuing visit when she was presented with a large vial of Gerasian Liquor by representatives at a concert in London.

The representatives were apparently unaware that the beverage has recently been outlawed in the Empire, and anyone caught carrying it within Imperial territory could be subject to severe sanctions.

Federation officials were quick to deny that it was a deliberate ploy to cause further inconvenience to the visiting Senator, whose reception has been dogged with controversy in equal measure to the unexpected popularity she has received from the general populace.

Lady Kahina received the gift in good grace. When questioned about the illegality of the beverage in her home jurisdiction she replied with « They really needn't worry, I'll drink it all before I get home. »


* Onionhead Sales Still Growing
The Federal ban may have been enough to scare the Tanmark Defence Force into purging Lucan Onionhead plantations from their world, but Panem continues to stand defiant.

It's been only two weeks since the original Onionhead went back on sale in Harvestport, and already the supply has started flowing as far away as Berrivi and Aapelinja.

So far the Federation has done little to stop the resurgence of Onionhead. Political pundits have been quick to suggest that this lethargy is most likely due to the fact that the President is paralysed by her (low) polling numbers. With her numbers so low, any mistake could cost the President her presidency.

President Halsey's indecision will come as good news for Georgio Algeria and the Kappa Fornacis Famers Union, who will doubtless continue growing credits as quickly as they can in preparation for any potential blowback from the Federation.


* Hudson Swears to Succeed Where Halsey Failed!
Appearing on the popular Federal Politics Show, 'Face the People', Shadow President Hundson faced some tough questions about his recent criticism of President Halsey.

When asked if he felt it was appropriate for an official of his level to so openly attack a presidential incumbent, Hudson had this to say on the matter:

« Well it's like this. I feel our nation is in serious jeopardy, in no small part as a direct result of the President's actions. So far we've been lucky. Her incompetence has only led to the deaths of a few hundred thousand Federal citizens. But what's going to happen when Hengist finally dies and that maniac takes the throne in his place? Will Halsey protect us then? Personally I wouldn't count on it. So yes, I think valid criticisms of the President's leadership is absolutely in order at this point »

When asked what he would have done differently to President Halsey, Hudson replied:

« It comes down to proper application of resources. Kids training to protect our nation are kids that are too busy to take drugs or hide away in video games. A well trained military, coupled with proper strategic execution, would ensure Federal dominance throughout occupied space. I mean let's face it, it doesn't take a genius to know that if our boys need weapons to win a war, the very least you should do is make sure they have them. »


* Princess Arissa Addresses the Nation
In what can only be seen as a result of the attack on her alleged father, Princess Arissa Lavigny-Duval has today broken her long silence in an address to the nation on the steps of the Imperial Palace.

« Honoured citizens of the Empire, my Imperial brothers and sisters, I come before you today not as a Princess or as a Senator, but as a concerned daughter of this nation. »

« In our father's long absence, certain undesirable elements have sought to usurp the right and just laws which govern our civilisation. Through their dishonourable actions they seek to unravel the delicate threads that bind us together as a great and unified society. »

« The house of Duval will not allow the madness of the few to undo everything that we have struggled so long to achieve. I swear to you, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the Emperor's protection will stand. You will not live in fear of hunger, of sickness, of weakness or shame. »

« Enemies of the Imperial court beware. This is your one warning. You will not get another. »


* Hudson Takes Tour of Brightlight Facilities in Hors
Shadow President Hudson, accompanied by several of Admiral Vincent's closest aides, received a warm greeting when he visited the Hors system earlier today. The group met with Duke Sanders to discuss the possibility of extending the remit of Brightlight Training's Federal contracts.

Representing the gold standard in private training centres, Brightlight offers a variety of educational services to corporations throughout the Federation. With the recent failures in communication between the Commander-in-Chief and her advisors in the Federal Navy, it appears that Admiral Vincent has decided it is long past time for the Navy to update the way its officers are trained.

Sources within the Brightlight Training Corporation are said to be very happy with the way the meeting went. No new contracts have been agreed between the two parties, but all reports indicate that Brightlight has begun ramping up its operations in preparation for an imminent services deployment.


* President Halsey Addresses Accusations
President Jasmina Halsey has finally chosen to directly address Shadow President Hudson's campaign to see her removed from office. In a statement issued during a rare appearance on 'Face the People', the President had this to say about her current situation:

\I am deeply disappointed by Mr Hudson's conduct. Have mistakes been made? Perhaps. But I say to you, any mistakes that were made, were made worse due to the constant interference of certain parties within our own ranks.\

\As President, the command of our armed forces falls to me, but it does not fall to me alone. The idea that I, personally, am responsible for the Federal Navy's failure to properly secure their supply lines is patently ridiculous. As is the accusation that I am somehow responsible for pilots properly identifying their targets before murdering thousands of our civilians. I have no doubt the residents of our great Federation are smart enough to know what's really going on here.\

\I am proud to serve as your President and I intend to do so for a very long time to come.\


* In the Emperor's Name
The last week has seen a bustle of activity in Imperial space.

Senator Torval went head to head with Aisling Duval to prove once and for all that Imperial Slavery is here to stay. Aisling's Angels did the best they could to support the people's princess, freeing an astonishing 1,149,756 Imperial Slaves in the span of just one week. Unfortunately for the diva Duval, the Imperial Slavers Association managed to acquire a staggering 2,387,567 Unregulated Slaves in the same space of time.

The Unregulated Slaves are currently undergoing an intensive ISA-certified retraining regime. The graduates of which are expected to go on sale from Lagerkvist Gateway next weekend.

Princess Arissa has been making her presence felt by shining a light on the darker corners of the Empire. Thousands of criminals have been apprehended by Commanders working on behalf of Arissa, although sadly only a handful of them have been able to provide any clues as to who ordered the attack on the Emperor. The Princess will announce what new information has come to light once her Imperial courtiers have finished with their current investigation.

Finally, Senator Patreus has reached a new financial agreement with Themiscrya, a system that owes the Senator a sizeable debt due to loans taken out by the current government before they came to power. In less pleasant news, Silver Universal PLC (the Senator's financial services subsidiary) has announced that from next week it will be raising interest rates on all outstanding debts owed to the Senator.


* Themiscrya Reaches Agreement on National Debt
Senator Denton Patreus issued notice 8 days ago of his intention to seek legal recourse over the Nationals of Themiscrya's failure to meet their financial obligations. The news sent waves of panic through the tiny independent system, with many residents choosing to flee rather than risk being turned into assets to appease the Senator.

However, reports coming from Ritchey Port indicate that a new debt agreement has been reached between Silver Universal PLC and the Nationals of Themiscrya, effectively ending any imminent action from Senator Patreus's legal team.

It is believed that the new agreement only came about due to the efforts of several dozen small business owners, whose tireless efforts over the last week have seen Themiscrya enjoy a small period of economic boom. This in turn provided the funds needed for the Nationals of Themiscrya to pay off the principal on their debt.


* Imperial Citizens are Meant to Fly
Evidently the Senator from Facece wasn't engaging in empty political posturing when she said that she would find those responsible for the attack on her father. On Arissa's orders a sizeable number of Counts and Earls have flocked to Facece to help investigate both their fellow nobility and the citizenry under their care.

Now, in a move doubtlessly spurred by the ongoing investigation, reports coming from Nu state that the Princess Lavigny-Duval has ordered a sizeable fleet of Imperial Clippers be constructed in the shipyards of Syromyatnikov Horizons. The Senator's office on Facece has stated that the project will be jointly overseen by the Citizens of Tradition and the Gutamaya Corporation.

When asked why she felt the need to establish her own personal fleet, the Princess had this to say:

« There is a venom running through the veins of our great nation, a poison that threatens to consume each and every one of us through our own avarice and spite. This fleet represents a cure. It will be a lance of light that acts to purge the darkness threatening to engulf our homes and corrupt our children. With this fleet I will reclaim our people's honour, and in doing so I will bring a true and lasting peace to the streets of the Empire. »


* Exphiay Entertains Shadow President
This evening marks the 153rd annual Exphiay Bankers' Ball. Shadow President Hudson will be in attendance, as will Frank Hall \u2013 CEO of Gallant Investment, Paul Wiggins \u2013 CEO of Wiggins Development Trust, and Patricia Spellman \u2013 Vice President of Sirius Finance.

The 1 million-credits-a-head dinner will see the Federation's rich and famous rub shoulders with some of the galaxy's most influential powerbrokers. One of the main topics of conversation is expected to revolve around fiscal responsibility in the face of the continued failing of the current Federal leadership.

Notable absences include President Halsey and Vice President Naylor, both of whom were reportedly not invited to the star-studded event. Further reports indicate that well-known liberal leaning corporations such as Better Green Developments, Roach Investment Banking, Worster Insurance, Lycan Moon Mining and Benton's Natural Remedies were also all deliberately blocked from attending.


* The Low Cost of Lives
The office of Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval issued a statement this morning to reveal what information had been collected by members of the Imperial Court loyal to the House of Duval.

« The Princess is extremely grateful for the support offered by her allies in these difficult times. »

« As expected, the interrogation of the would-be-assassin failed to produce any useful information as to who ordered the attack. Fortunately the ex-assassin was persuaded to divulge the name of the organisation that tasked them with the attempt. »

« Members of the Imperial Court were dispatched to investigate the matter in more detail, and thanks to work carried out by Count von Auerburg, Earl Rednam and Earl Khaelmin we now know where to concentrate our efforts on next. »

« Have no fear loyal citizens. Even now the Princess is preparing to initiate the next stage of the investigation. The Princess will catch those responsible, and she will make them pay for their transgressions. »


* When Worlds Collide
Reports are coming in from all over the Federation of a resurgence in nightclubs catering to under-40s. Analysts are at a loss to explain why so many Federal youths have suddenly decided to abandon their artificial realities in favour of physical content, but the numbers don't lie.

Over 30% of under-40s who responded to a recent GalNet poll said that they'd visited a physical nightclub in the last month, compared to just 12% during the same period last year.

The shift has already seen billions of credits being poured into local Federal economies. This is causing a series of economic booms that are allowing some previously stagnant systems to begin a period of expansion, the likes of which they haven't experienced in years.

It isn't all good news, though. Several dozen regions have reported an increase in violent crimes linked with various youth gatherings. So far most instances of violence have been self-contained, but political pundits are concerned about more widespread implications should the number of gatherings continue to grow.


* Public Polled on President
Recent GalPoll results show that the President's popularity continues to fall, with her approval rating now down to an abysmal 16%, the lowest approval rating of any President to have ever remained in office in the history of the Federation.

Some (anonymous) comments from the survey are included below:

\This woman, who bombs innocent planets, who happily slaughters people, and, you know, pumps the food chain full of garbage and just everything evil she does, she probably thinks it's funny. Well it's not funny. It's sick. She should be ashamed of herself. \

\Does President Halsey even stand for anything? Seems to me all she does is chase around desperately trying to get people to like her. Well, newsflash, Mrs President, no one likes you.\

\I think the President is a good woman. She did a lot of good back home and I'm sure she could do a lot of good as a member of Congress. A good President though? No. I'm afraid she's just not a good fit.\

\I didn't vote for her then, and I wouldn't vote for her now!\


* Kui Hsien and Quivira Refuse Raise in Rates
Last week it was announced that Silver Universal PLC, the financial branch of the military corporate conglomerate led by Senator Patreus, would be raising interest rates on all outstanding loan agreements.

Following the news, several dozen independent systems reached out to Silver Universal PLC to ask to refinance their previously agreed loans. Silver Universal PLC was gracious enough to work with its debtors to come to new arrangements wherever possible. In some instances, new deals could not be made, but Imperia} is confident that most of its clients will continue to honour their agreements, regardless of any short term difficulties they may currently be facing.

Unfortunately, not all debtors were willing to face up to their responsibilities. In particular, Kui Hsien and Quivira have refused to acknowledge Silver Universal PLC's legal right to increase its rates.

In protest, both systems have stopped all payments to Silver Universal PLC. A particularly dangerous gambit given the Senator's history when dealing with systems that refuse to pay their debts.


* Patreus and the Princess Share Food for Thought
Denton Patreus and Aisling Duval were spotted grabbing dinner in Capitol late last night at the very exclusive pop-up restaurant, Fodder. The Empire's favourite power couple appeared to have a good time, with the pair polishing off several bottles of Chateau De Aegaeon during the course of their three-hour meal.

Aisling looked stunning in a lace red dress with matching accessories. Senator Patreus was his usual dashing self, although he had chosen to go for a more casual unbuttoned look for his dinner date with the people's princess.

After dinner the pair are believed to have retired to the Senator's ship, the Imperial Freedom, which departed Capitol for Eotienses this morning. According to Capitol Space Control, Aisling was onboard the Imperial Freedom when it departed.


* President Under Pressure to Punish Panem
Shadow President Hudson appeared before Congress earlier today to demand that President Halsey address the continued spread of Onionhead throughout Federal space.

Despite the implementation of aggressive Federal policies aimed at criminalising possession and distribution of Onionhead, recent reports suggest that Onionhead sales have gone up by as much as 800% in some regions.

With prohibition clearly failing, Congress is now calling on the President to once again act against the Onionhead plantations on Panem. So far, the President has been reluctant to launch another attack on Panem, citing the existence of Lucan Onionhead as proof that an all-out assault on the Onionhead fields will only result in driving the operation underground.

While the President is almost certainly correct in her assessment of the situation, that fact is unlikely to stop Shadow President Hudson from demanding she does everything in her power to shut down Panem's production once and for all.


* Hudson has Medical Meeting in Mongan
The Shadow President's tour of the Federation continued this week with a visit to the Reyan BPS headquarters aboard Moisuc Station, Mongan.

Shadow President Hudson met with healthcare mogul and Reyan BPS CEO, Sam Reyan, to discuss ways in which Reyan BPS and the Federal government can come together to ensure a healthier future for all members of the Federation.

Subjects under discussion included a potential universal healthcare scheme, improved supply chains for frontier worlds and a number of undisclosed projects that would operate under the purview of the Federal Navy. The proposed deals could be worth trillions of credits to Reyan BPS, a corporation who has traditionally struggled to penetrate the ultra-lucrative congressional contracts market.

With so much corporate support beginning to stabilise behind Hudson, it's only a matter of time before the Shadow President finally makes his move to out Halsey from office.


* East India Company Announces Galactic Silk Road
The East India Company, one of the larger pilots' federation members, recently announced a new initiative they are calling « the Galactic Silk Road ». This is a public trade route available to all, and features seventeen of the most highly profitable stops in civilised space.

Although profitable trade routes are nothing new, the East India Company spokesperson in charge of the route, a CMDR Bunny, announced that the organisation will provide protection to those traders wanting to benefit, and has even gone as far as to say that arrangements have been made with the Federal Navy, Mercs of Mikunn, the Merchant Marines, and other factions, in order to patrol the route and protect traders.

The new route is named after the famous four thousand mile trade route across Earth's continents of Europe and Asia, first seen over three thousand years ago, where merchants made large profits trading silk cloth, while the wealth helped the emerging cultures along the route to prosper and develop.

The stations involved in the new trade scheme are:

Gentil Hub in Harm

Hiya Orbital in Arjung

Lichtenberg City in Scirth

Oren City in Kaliki

Austin Market in Bommatsuri

Weaver Port in Feng Tanga

Capek Orbital in HIP 9989

Houtman Dock in Popocassa

Wachmann Vision in Lileni

Goddard Dock in Xi Wang Mu

Henson Gateway in Dheneb

Giunta Gateway in HIP 7916

Gould Ring in HIP 8830

Harawi Enterprise in HIP 9753

Naddoddur Hub in HR 827

Fabian Term in Badbadzist

Kagawa Vision in Nidayiman


* The Talons of Justice
During an exclusive interview with the popular Imperial politics programme, 'Question Everything', Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval provided some new insight into the ongoing investigation into the attempted assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval.

« The fact that anyone would attack the Emperor, in his own palace, when for all intents and purposes he's already on his deathbed, is symptomatic of a very serious sickness within our society. »

« Certain elements, criminal and otherwise, see the current situation as an opportunity to advance their own agendas. At a time when we should be standing together as one nation, one voice, instead we find ourselves fractured and alone. »

« It doesn't need to be this way. Together we are stronger than those who wish to seek to tear us down. «

« As proof of that, information provided by Imperial citizens loyal to the ideals upon which our nation was founded has proven invaluable in the hunt for those who sought to strike against us. In particular, agents of the Imperial Court have uncovered two potential locations which may well hold the answers we seek. »

« I call on any pilot who has ever dreamed of honouring the legacy of our great Empire. Assist me in teaching the Emperor's wayward sons exactly what it means to truly be a member of the greatest nation in the galaxy. »

Following the interview, word arrived at GalNet that citizens wishing to work with the Princess's new investigative task force can sign up to do so at either of the following locations:

Xuesen Orbital in Nehet

Kowal Dock in Mictlan


* Imperial Law and Order: Investigation into Attack on Emperor Continues
Arissa Lavigny-Duval's ongoing investigation in to the attack on the Emperor took the Princess to Nehet yesterday, where the Senator from Facece directed her followers to launch an all out attack on the Nehet Silver Ring.

Hundreds of pilots answered Arissa's call to arms, and under the direction of the Patrons of Law the makeshift fleet was able to provide more than enough firepower to grind the Nehet Silver Ring into dust. While crime is still a problem for the citizens of Nehet, at least it has finally been brought back to a manageable level.

During the process of dismantling the NSR's operation, agents loyal to Arissa uncovered evidence that criminals operating in and around Almad may have helped facilitate the attack against the Emperor.

At the same time, hundreds more pilots answered the Princess's call to end all criminal activity taking place in Mictlan. This inevitably resulted in the Mictlan Cartel being crushed beneath the weight of Arissa's stylish yet affordable Clippers (which are still available at a significant discount from Syromyatnikov Horizons in Nu).

Before the cartel's leadership met their final fate, a team of Imperial inquisitors were able to convince them to reveal who brokered the deal to strike against the Emperor. This new information points to the presence of a previously unknown underworld consultancy, who are believed to be based somewhere in the vicinity of LTT 9810.

Commanders interested in aiding the ongoing investigation can sign up for active duty at Heinkel City in Almad, and Gutierrez Terminal in LTT 9810.


* Synteini Slave Sale Honours Emperor
Last week Zemina Torval and Aisling Duval went head to head in a contest Imperial citizens have dubbed the 'Great Slaver Showdown'. Both parties used the competition as an excuse to promote their own radical philosophies regarding the laws surrounding Imperial Slavery, and it looks like we finally know whose stance the Imperial public supports more.

During the course of the competition, Aisling's Angels freed an impressive 1,149,756 slaves, but this effort was dwarfed by supporters of the Imperial Slavers Association, who provided a better way of life for 2,387,567 non-citizens.

In recognition of the efforts of everyone who took part in the competition, the office of Senator Torval released the following statement to GalNet:

« The ISA would like to thank all participants for the overwhelming support shown for the Imperial Slavers Association and the Imperial way of life we represent. »

« Sadly even our state of the art facilities couldn't get the almost two and a half million new recruits ready for sale in such a short space of time. However, never let it be said that Zemina Torval does not keep her promises. »

« In honour of the Emperor, for the glory of the House of Duval, and in recognition of all they have done to advance our people and culture, Senator Torval has today authorised the sale of 5 million Imperial Slaves, to be made available in the markets of Lagerkvist Gateway.\

« 5 million Imperial Slaves. 20% off regular retail price. Only while stocks last. »


* Silver Allied Network Implicated in Attack on Emperor!
Thousands of Imperial bounty hunters answered the call of Princess Arissa over the last week, joining her in the hunt to uncover the identity of the cabal behind the cowardly attack on the ailing Emperor.

Acting on the advice of several trustworthy members of the Imperial court, the Princess began by disrupting several large-scale criminal operations taking place in Nehet and Mictlan. Hundreds of Imperial Commanders loyal to the Princess descended on the systems in force. The fury of the makeshift fleet shattered the local gangs, and within 24 hours the fighting was over.

Information uncovered during the strike on Mictlan led investigators to LTT 9810, a system under the protection of Senator Zemina Torval. There it became apparent that a rogue division of the LTT 9810 Silver Allied Network had been acting as a financial consultancy service for some of the more successful Imperial crime families.

Senator Torval, along with SAN's board of directors, has denied any knowledge of the rogue division's activity. They have now opened up their records to Princess Arissa's investigators, who are currently hard at work trying to trace a series of payments that they believe may lead back to the cabal responsible for the attack.

The Princess has requested that members of her fleet remain close to Achenar. As soon as any new information is available, the next stage of the investigation will begin.


* The Hunt for Justice
Senator Patreus has today begun the process of sending his agents to reclaim the debt owed to him by the government of Kui Hsien.

The Friends of Kui Hsien, the cooperative council that rules over the region, had previously entered into an agreement with Senator Patreus to supply Kui Hsien with the arms they needed to repel an invasion by the Federal-aligned Future of LTT 911 Party.  Kui Hsien's economy was devastated during the war with LTT 911, and the Friends now find themselves in the unenviable position of being unable to repay their debt.

Over the last week, dozens of local traders have gone to extraordinary efforts to stimulate Kui Hsien's economy. Sadly their efforts were not enough, as the Friends of Kui Hsien still find themselves unable to meet the financial demands placed on them by Senator Patreus and Eotienses Silver Universal PLC.

As a result, Senator Patreus has authorised the Conservatives of BV Phoenicis to begin the forfeiture process. Imperial mercenaries interested in participating in the reclamation effort are being invited to sign up for active duty aboard Aoki Dock in BV Phoenicis.


* Eotienses Rejuvenation Project Unveiled
In what many pundits are calling a clear attempt to consolidate his position as the most influential arms dealer in the Empire, Senator Denton Patreus has today announced an initiative to rejuvenate Parkinson Dock, in order to promote the development of High Tech goods in Eotienses.

The initiative, which is being overseen by the Citizens' Forum, aims to bring thousands of new jobs to the region. Imperial corporations are already engaged in a hot bidding war over rights to establish a presence on the newly reinvigorated Parkinson Dock, despite rumours that most of the available space has been reserved for businesses with established ties to the Senator.

In order to properly repurpose the facilities aboard Parkinson Dock, the Citizens' Forum has placed several sizable orders of Industrial Materials in the local market. Once those orders are filled, engineers will be able to start work on the rejuvenation process.


* Torval Apologises for Synteini Slave Snafu
Last weekend the Imperial Slavers Association was supposed to make 5 million Imperial Slaves available for a significant discount in the markets aboard Lagerkvist Gateway. Much to the dismay of hundreds of eager Imperial traders, the slaves (and their associated discount) were delayed by members of Princess Lavigny-Duval's retinue as they attempted to pass through LTT 9810.

This unfortunate snafu meant that the ISA was unable to make good on Senator Zemina Torval's promise. Reports from those close to the Senator state that Zemina was furious when she learned that Princess Arissa's agents had seized her shipment. However, in light of the Silver Allied Network incident, the Senator is said to have since seen the wisdom of the investigators' actions.

In a statement released earlier today, Senator Torval had this to say:

« It is with deep embarrassment that I must apologise to all those whose businesses were unfortunately affected by the ongoing investigation into the attack on our beloved Emperor. »

« I have no doubt that Senator Lavigny's agents acted with the Emperor's best interests at heart. As do we all. Indeed I urge those hard working loyalists to come and partake in the fantastic selection of discounted produce we have available for sale in Synteini. » »

« A fresh shipment of Imperial Slaves is currently being prepared for sale at Lagerkvist Gateway. The sale is now officially underway, as promised, but stock levels will remain low until the new shipment arrives in Synteini later this week. »


* Patreus and Aisling Attend Benefit Gala
Denton Patreus and Aisling Duval were spotted in attendance at 'A Dinner to Defeat Dementia' in Capitol last night. The Empire's favourite power couple spent several hours mingling with Senators, CEOs and a few of the charity's lucky patrons, before dazzling the crowd with a rather energetic display on the dance floor.

Aisling was dressed in an unusually demure, long necked, floor length red gown with flowing sleeves. The Senator was dressed casually in an open necked navy blue shirt with stylish silver trimming along the collar and cuffs.

The couple were accompanied by Aisling's new entourage, a dozen young orphans, dubbed Aisling's 'Cherubs' by the attendees. The children delighted the crowd by singing, dancing and reciting several epic works of Imperial poetry.


* Race to Center of Galaxy Starts in Sol
Pilots from all over civilized space are gathering on Galileo station near planet Earth to begin one of the most ambitious organized rally race ever attempted. Called the Buckyball Run A*, this endurance race challenges commanders to reach the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*, in the shortest amount of time possible. This contest is the latest iteration of the popular Buckyball Runs, a series of unsanctioned point-to-point rally races across the galaxy.

According to Mirana Ortilano, a spokesperson for the event, the choice of Sagittarius A* as the finish line is explained by its significance as the center of the Milky Way galaxy. « It's a pilgrimage for many, for many different reasons. We're just helping pilots get there faster. »

The Buckyball Run A* however differs from the previous competitions as this time the challenge will remain permanently open. To elaborate on this difference, Mirana Ortilano adds: « This is the first long distance endurance challenge. Needless to say, the risk and commitment of the pilots are much greater than in previous runs. »

Although there is no prize to be won, she insists that « there is a tangible benefit. Commanders who run more than one Buckyball are invariably better pilots.The skills earned will stay with a pilot through his or her entire career. »

The Buckyball Braben Star-to-Shining-Star Memorial Trophy Dash, simply known as the Buckyball Run, is not endorsed by any official organization. Commanders seeking to participate in this contest are asked to register directly with representatives of the Buckyball Run.

At the time of broadcast, the galactic record holder for the fastest travel from Galileo station to Sgr A* is commander Anuranium, at the helm of a Faulcon DeLacy Anaconda.

* Justice Isn't Always Blind
Just when it looked like the trail was turning cold, a new clue has been uncovered in the investigation into the attack on the Emperor.

According to forensic accountants working on behalf of Princess Lavigny-Duval, the evidence suggests that rogue members of Silver Allied Network channelled funds for the attack through Silver Universal Plc. The credits were then sent to an account in the HR 706 system.

Sources close to the investigation informed GalNet that the clue was actually uncovered several days ago, but certain groups within the Empire had been slow in granting the Princess's fleet unrestricted access to the system.

Whatever the truth, Princess Lavigny-Duval has finally sent word for her fleet to begin dismantling all crime syndicates operating in HR 706. It is believed that Emperor's Grace has lodged a formal complaint with the Senate over Senator Lavigny's incursion into their system, but so far the complaint has gone unanswered.

Imperial citizens interested in aiding the Princess with her investigation are being asked to report for active duty aboard Laming Orbital.


* Merchant Marines Launch Operation Papercut
Reports coming in from Eotienses indicate that a group of Federal Commanders, known as the Merchant Marines, are currently engaged in a series of unauthorised attacks against Imperial traders in the employ of Senator Patreus.

In a statement released to GalNet, the Merchant Marines had this to say:

« The Merchant Marines have launched Operation Papercut. We plan to blockade the Eotienses system in an attempt to stop Imperial traders from supplying Parkinson Dock with industrial materials. The group fears that High Tech production could turn Eotienses into a catalyser for the Imperial war machine already fuelled by Denton Patreus. »

« The Marines intend to interdict all traders in the system and thus halt economic growth. Traders will be given a single warning to leave the system. Any further action will result in more aggressive coercion. »

GalNet reached out to President Halsey's office to request an official statement in regards to the Merchant Marines' actions. At time of press, the President's office had not yet chosen to reply.


* Hudson Praises Merchant Marines
Shadow President Hudson returned to Mars today, where a throng of eager reporters waited to get the latest scoop on the Shadow President's campaign to remove President Halsey from office. Instead the Shadow President had some choice words to say about the Merchant Marines and their unsanctioned operations in Empire space.

« I hear there's been a lot of nasty accusations flying around Congress the last few days. Some have even used words like agent provocateurs, rebels, terrorists. All used to describe the brave men and women fighting to preserve our safety out there in the black. »

« Well, I have another word for you. »

« Heroes. »

« The Empire is ramping up for war, we can all see that. It's only a matter of time before they set their eyes on Sol. Will we just sit here and watch them come? Is that how the birthplace of civilisation is going to be fall? »

« Obviously I can't condone Federal forces operating in Imperial space. Certainly Congress didn't authorise any such action. However, I can't help but respect those brave fools for what they're trying to do. »

« Get home safe, Commanders. We'll be waiting for you when you do. »


* Travel Advisory for NGC 6124
Warning: A Travel Advisory is issued for system NGC 6124 SECTOR  DW-N C6-10.

This system should be avoided, but not due to solar storms.

Explorer Lance 'Spacecat' D. (last name withheld) warped in-system only to find himself inside the corona of the system's 'B' star which is abnormally close to the 'A' star. He only survived the experience thanks to quick reflexes, an auto field maintenance unit and the ruggedness of his scorched type-6, now nicknamed the 'Sundiver'. He reprimands the system's previous explorer (name withheld) for NOT issuing such a travel advisory.


* Reorte Liberated by the Alliance
After 3 weeks of intense activity in the Lave Cluster, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps (AEDC) has managed to return control of Reorte to an Alliance aligned faction.

Earlier this month, a local pirate group had attempted to rename the cluster as the \New Caribbean\.  While local residents were not in favour of the move, the Alliance military was initially slow to take the pirate threat seriously.

However, undercover agents working on behalf of the AEDC have been working tirelessly with local community groups in order to prepare the ground for a swift battle to retake control of Davies High.

As planned, the conflict ended swiftly and caused little disruption to the daily life of residents. Pilots from the pirate faction fought fiercely to defend their position, but the combined might of Alliance forces proved too strong, and locals woke this morning to find the \Pro-Alliance League\ restoring order to their community.

Alliance approval in Reorte now stands at a staggering 93%!

Elsewhere in the cluster, groups loyal to the Alliance of Independent Systems are visibly taking the pirate threat more seriously. In Lave itself, news of their neighbours' long anticipated victory boosted the ruling \Workers of Lave Liberals\ by over 20% in a flash opinion poll this morning! The combined influence for Lave's Alliance factions now appears to be over 80%.

The burning question on everyone's lips in the Old Worlds is now:

\When will Leesti return to the fold?\

It is likely that after reclaiming Reorte with minimal fuss, the experienced negotiators of AEDC are planning something similar in the cluster's most important high-tech trading system.


* Emperor's Grace Indicted in Attack on Emperor
Several weeks ago, Imperial Palace security uncovered an attempted plot to poison Emperor Hengist Duval. Princess Lavigny-Duval and Chancellor Blaine both launched their own investigations into the matter.

The Chancellor's men managed to locate and question the would-be-assassin, but they were unable to extract any useful information.

Fortunately, members of the Imperial Court had more success. They identified several criminal syndicates operating in the areas around Nehet and Mictlan that were rumoured to have ties with a secretive underworld wetwork firm.

After smashing more than a few pirate dens, Imperial investigators learned that funds for the hit had been channelled via Silver Allied Network through Silver Universal Plc to an unknown group in HR 706.

Senator Lavigny's request to pursue her investigation into HR 706 was originally met with refusal by members of Emperor's Grace, who even went so far as to lodge an official protest with the Senate. Emperor's Grace would later find themselves forced to acquiesce under orders issued by Senator Patreus.

Now it looks like Emperor's Grace had good reason to want the Princess kept out of the system, as late last night, new information came to light which has implicated the leadership of Emperor's Grace in the attack on the Emperor. Senator Patreus is disavowing any knowledge of the incident, although he has so far refused to allow any members of Emperor's Grace to be removed from HR 706.

Senator Lavigny will be formally presenting the evidence against Emperor's Grace to the Senate tomorrow.


* President Halsey Denounces Patron's Principles
This weekend saw the outbreak of a skirmish between Imperial and Federal forces in the small but significant system of Volungu. Reports indicate that the conflict was started by the Patron's Principles, an Empire-aligned organisation based in the nearby Liaedin region.

For years Liaedin was caught in almost constant civil war as the Faveol and Blossom families fought to gain control of the region. The two sides eventually settled their differences, with the Imperial Faveol family ultimately being given governorship of the system.

Now it looks as if the feud could be starting up again, as the Faveol family-run Patron's Principles have made the seemingly rash decision to attempt to expand their influence beyond Liaedin's borders.

President Halsey has denounced the move by Patron's Principles, calling it 'a reckless abandonment of years of hard-won peace'. The Federal Navy has launched a small fleet to repel the invasion, and has requested that any Commanders interested in securing Volungu should sign up for active duty aboard Jemison Refinery.

When asked for comment, Chancellor Blaine's office stated that the Patron's Principles were acting without the support or knowledge of the Imperial Senate. Imperial sources close to the region noted that members of the East India Company have been dispatched to the area to try to resolve the matter peacefully.


* President Halsey Announces Tour of Frontier Systems
The President's office has today announced that President Halsey will soon be setting off on a tour of the Federal frontier systems.

The purported aim of the trip is to build stronger links between Sol and its many offspring. For years, Federal frontier systems have complained that the Mars Congress has consistently failed to provide adequate support for fledgling Federal colonies.

During the tour, local leaders will be given a chance to meet with President Halsey to discuss what Sol can do to better support local governments, frontier enterprises and Federal residents.

Some of the destinations announced include Hip 53688, Tinia, 78 Ursae Majoris, Su and Furuhjlem I-645. Other destinations are expected to be added at a later date.


* Arissa Prepares to Present Evidence to Imperial Senate
At a conference held ahead of today's closed meeting of the Senate, Senator Arissa Lavigny addressed her supporters in a speech streamed live from the Lavigny family home on Topaz.

« The last few weeks have been difficult for us all, but I am pleased to announce that our trials are almost over. »

« Evidence collected by members of the court, which includes members of Emperor's Grace loyal to the house of Duval, has provided my investigators with irrefutable proof that the leadership of the HR 706 Chapter of Emperor's Grace did, with malicious aforethought and intent, act to commit treason most foul against our beloved father. »

« Today I will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the HR 706 Chapter of Emperor's Grace has allowed itself to become intimately entangled with a villainous network of psychopaths, sociopaths and other assorted scum. Among them, the organisation which provided the would-be-killer for use in this foul conspiracy. »

« This stain against our Empire's honour will not be allowed to stand. Justice will be done this day. »

« Hail to the Emperor, bask in his glory. »


* Victory in Volungu for Federal Forces
The war-torn region of Volungu has been under intense scrutiny over the last few days, as a centuries-old feud between the Faveols and the Blossoms threatened to reignite and engulf the region in a wave of bloodshed.

According to sources in the Patron's Principles' home system Liaedin, the attack on Volungu was carried out by a group of younger family members. Having never experienced war themselves, and inspired by the recent influx of Imperial combat veterans to the region, the young Faveols foolishly chose to attack their neighbours in a misguided quest for glory.

Federal pilots, eager to maintain the peace, flocked to Volungu in their thousands. Now, just a few days later, the threat from the Patron's Principles has been neutralised. Their leadership has apologised and an uneasy peace has settled on the system once more.


* Quivira Feels the Wrath of Patreus
Deep in the heart of the Empire, a handful of nations stand defiantly independent from their neighbours.

One such nation is Quivira. Home to 37.5 million residents, Quivira has managed to maintain its independence by acting as a major supplier of industrial goods to its neighbours.

Early last year Quivira suffered from a period of deep recession, during which time it took out a series of bridge loans with Silver Universal Plc . A recent increase in rates left the People's Quivira for Equality Party unable to pay off their debts, a fact which has caused the system to become the victim of legal action carried out on behalf of Senator Patreus.

Quivira Electronics Plc, an Imperial corporation, has now been authorised to actively reclaim the debt owed to Senator Patreus by the system's current leadership. As a first step towards that goal, Quivira Electronics Plc has taken ownership of Stepledon Dock. With the Senator's blessing, Quivira Electronics is now hiring freelance reclamation agents to help extract the remaining debt.

In response, the People's Quivira for Equality Party have set up a defence fund with the Bank of Zaonce, the contents of which will be paid out to any independent pilots who come to Quivira's aid in its time of need. The defence of Quivira is being organised aboard Godel Dock.


* Patreus Responds to 'Unfounded' Accusations
After a heated meeting of the Senate held earlier today, Senator Patreus made a rare appearance on 'Question Everything' to address the accusations levelled against Emperor's Grace by Senator Lavigny.

« This is outrageous, » the Senator began.

« Emperor's Grace has served as the loyal stewards of HR 706 for decades. A fact Senator Lavigny is well aware of. »

« The very idea that one of my own would dare instigate such an attack without my knowledge is preposterous. It would never happen. »

« It's clear what this is actually all about. »

« If Senator Lavigny wishes to accuse me of something, she had better come up with more evidence than that weak pile of fabricated drek she calls proof. »

« If the Senator has anything of substance to share, I suggest she present it. I will not allow my men to be martyred for the sake of the Senator's lust for the throne. »

« Emperor's Grace has my full support. They will continue to govern HR 706 in my stead and their leaders will be released from their false imprisonment immediately. These trumped-up charges will not stand. »

According to security personnel on Achenar, the leadership of Emperor's Grace has been released into Senator Patreus's custody, and are currently serving under house arrest in HR 706.


* Prism Senator Planning New Voyage?
Leaked images from the Avalon shipyards appear to indicate that Senator Kahina Tijani Loren's Imperial Courier, the 'Seven Veils', is undergoing a significant refit just weeks after her recent visit to the Sol system.

Security at the Avalon shipyards, which are owned and managed by Persephone station, is extremely tight. The images themselves are grainy and ill-defined, but seem to show that the drives, shields and possibly the frame-shift drive components have been significantly upgraded.

Sources within the Empire note that Senator Loren has been seen at several significant social events within Imperial space recently. Despite this, she has refrained from speaking to any member of the press since returning from Sol.

Speculation is rife as to her involvement with the ongoing struggle for power within the Senate. Loren has yet to declare her support for any of the leading contenders, a fact which some political pundits believe is a strong indication that she may be considering her own play for power.


* Securing the Old Worlds
For months now, the Old Worlds have been terrorised by roaming gangs of psychopaths and thieves. Residents' pleas for help have been rejected by the Council of Admirals, who maintain that matters of internal security are the sole responsibility of member states. Many see this rise of lawlessness as an opportunity. Pilots on both sides of the law are now flocking to the sector in the hope of making their fame and fortune.

Inspired by the recent changes brought about by independent members of the Pilots Federation, a network of local business leaders have banded together to improve conditions in the Old Worlds. They are sponsoring the formation of a new coalition, and though they have yet to officially announce the group's manifesto, support for the movement is already spreading.

One member of the new coalition, Silver United Solutions, has announced that they are currently in the process of recruiting experienced security professionals to help protect the residents of Zaonce from the various gangs operating in the sector. Potential recruits are asked to report to Ridley Scott in Zaonce for assessment.


* Hostage Crisis in Eotienses Turns Bloody
A tense hostage situation in Eotienses on Tuesday morning turned bloody as East India Company members failed to negotiate the liberation of an Imperial trader from the Code, a well-known pirate group. The Imperial trader, unaffiliated with either group, was destroyed after an attempted escape, resulting in tens of millions of credits in property loss as well as small-scale skirmishes between the two organizations throughout the night. EIC members later went on to admit that poor communication and victim anxiety led to this tragic outcome.

Though it is unclear exactly what the hostage believed, Commander Trillen is quoted as saying: « The members of Code appeared to be getting a little jumpy and I started to worry that things were not going to end well. I contacted Commander Egg90 asking if he was ready to run if $@%# hit the fan, but I think he misinterpreted that because at that very second he boosted and was destroyed by the members of Code. »

After the destruction of the trader, chaos broke out as both sides opened fire on one another. The fighting was reported to have lasted for several hours with both sides suffering major losses, and damages are currently estimated in the hundreds of millions of credits.

Galnet News reached out to The Code, who had this to say: « The approximate ship destruction estimate is currently sitting at 3 EIC deaths for every 1 Code death. The Code apologizes for the destruction of all these EIC vessels, but we will destroy anyone who gets in our path of riches and plunder. »

* Scientists Baffled by Mysterious Artefacts
Thanks to the efforts of dozens of Commanders taking part in a hunt across hundreds of systems, Dr. Arcannon and his team are delighted to announce that they have finally managed to retrieve an Unknown Artefact.

The artefact was recovered from a Federal Navy Convoy, following a broadcast from the group that their ships' systems were failing. CMDR Red Wizzard is said to have demonstrated outstanding initiative, bravery and skill in recovering the artefact. Sadly, none of the convoy survived to accompany Commander Wizzard back to civilisation.

A team of scientists are currently analysing the mysterious object in an undisclosed laboratory somewhere near Timocani. It is hoped that the artefact will provide a clue as to how to cure the people of He Bo.

Scientists working on the mysterious item have yet to ascertain the origins of the artefact. Early reports indicate that all attempts to take samples from the object have met with failure.

CMDR Arcanonn wishes to extend a warning to all Commanders. The artefacts emit a strange form of radiation that will severely damage the systems of any ship carrying the object. As such, all potential artefact hunters are advised to travel as part of a wing in case of module failure.


* Silver United Succeed at Securing Zaonce
After months of being terrorised by malicious criminals intent on turning the Old Worlds into some kind of 'New Caribbean', residents of the Lave cluster finally banded together this past weekend to crack down on the lawless scum that had been pillaging and plundering their way across the sector.

Inspired by the recent help freely given to the people of Reorte by the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, Silver United Solutions decided to offer a set of substantial rewards to any pilot brave enough to help remove the criminals known as the Jet Gang from Zaonce.

The initiative was an overwhelming success. 5,535 pilots were temporarily deputised during the course of the weekend, leading to the Zaonce Jet Gang (and many other local pirate crews) being crushed by the raw power of the makeshift fleet.

To celebrate their success, Silver United Solutions has organised a special discount on all Faulcon DeLacy ships being sold from Ridley Scott Station, Zaonce. A limited number of Pythons have been made available for the duration of the sale.


* Eyes on Quivira
Turmoil hit the small system of Quivira late last week, as thousands of Imperial pilots descended to deliver the wrath of Senator Denton Patreus on his debtors. In the first two days of the war, tens of thousands of Independent pilots lost their lives while bravely attempting to hold off Imperial forces from taking Godel Dock.

Despite the defenders' best efforts, Imperial ground troops were able to storm the station, seizing control of Quivira's defence systems and effectively bringing an end to the conflict during the early hours of Sunday morning.

In the face of overwhelming loss, the People's Quivira for Equality Party were forced to retreat to Brendan Gateway to lick their wounds. Once the people's party leadership had successfully regrouped, they launched a counterattack in an attempt to retake Godel Dock. With the help of hundreds of Independent and Federal pilots, the People's Quivira for Equality Party and the Nationalists of Quivira were successful in forcing Quivira Electronics Plc to retreat back to Stapledon Dock.

War has once again engulfed Quivira. No quarter is being offered, and none is expected. For troops on the ground, the only acceptable outcome is overwhelming victory or a quick and painless death.

Commanders willing to fight to defend Quivira from the Imperial invasion should sign up for active duty aboard Godel Dock.

Commanders wishing to profit from the subjugation of Quivira by Imperial forces should sign up for active duty aboard Stapledon Dock.


* Tour of Frontier Systems Set to Begin Shortly
Despite a rather sceptical response to the President's planned tour of Federal frontier systems, particularly the bizarre choice to visit 78 Ursae Majoris (a system which overwhelmingly voted to leave the Federation nearly two months ago), the President's office has announced that the series of visits with local leaders will go ahead as planned.

The following systems have already been announced as being part of the President's trip:

Hip 53688

Tinia

78 Ursae Majoris

Su

Furuhjlem I-645

Saga

Delphin

Nanoman

Coriccha

Ross 860

Another dozen systems are expected to be added before the President sets off on tour later in the week.


* Prism Senator Summoned to Achenar
Senator Kahina Tijani Loren's Imperial Courier was seen departing early morning local time from the Avalon shipyards. It rendezvoused with The Imperial Interdictor Atticus, Admiral Brice last known to be in command.

The convoy is believed to be enroute to the Achenar system.

According to the Imperial Herald, Senator Loren is « being hailed as a true daughter of the Empire, and assigned the rights and responsibilities as appropriate to her rank. »

Quite what this means is not clear, even to seasoned Imperial watchers.

Senator Loren's political leanings are even less clear. She is reportedly in favour of slavery, having been quoted as saying « Slavery is a safety net, it ensures nobody can starve or fall into poverty. »

She is also clearly prepared to use violence to achieve her aims \u2013 as revolutionaries on her home world of Prism were summarily executed after she returned to power.

By contrast she seems to be in favour of closer political ties with the Federation and the Alliance. Her recent trip to the Sol system was either a carefully orchestrated political gambit, or just happy chance. Either way, her positive profile with in the Federation is certainly a factor.

Senator Loren was involved in a wide-spread space battle during the reclamation of the Prism, which may have influenced her views on the effectiveness and desirability of major naval engagements.


* Arcanonn Challenges Halsey
Research into the recently recovered Unknown Artefact has intensified. Scientists, engineers and Commanders are flocking to assist Dr Arcanonn and his team from all across populated space, political allegiances temporarily forgotten in the search for answers.

Many theories have been hypothesised, among them that the Artefact is some kind of stasis pod, an alien exploration probe or even an exotic frame-shift drive. The object's strange sounds have been picked apart by experts and it has been subjected to a vast array of tests, including exposure to a sample of Hafnium 178 that was 'liberated for science' from yet another Federation convoy.

The mysterious object continues to defy all attempts at analysis and, in a controversial move, Dr Arcanonn has publicly accused the Federal authorities of withholding information regarding the Unknown Artefact.

He is quoted as saying, \On behalf of all humanity, my team and I demand answers. The potential repercussions of the Artefact's existence are staggering. We still know very little but it is clear that the technology involved is very different to our own. »

Commander Arcanonn concludes his appeal: « The potential for scientific advancements are huge but so are the dangers. The Federation has to come forward and tell us what they know of this object and its origins. The time for secrecy is over.\


* Hudson Demands Debate
It looks like the President may not be taking her planned tour after all, following news that Shadow President Hudson has publicly challenged President Halsey to a live policy debate on the popular Federal political stream show 'Face the People'.

So far, the President's office has declined to offer an official response to Shadow President Hudson's request.

The President is now in the unenviable position of having to turn down the Shadow President's request, which risks making the President appear weak at a time when she needs to appear strong in order to turn public opinion around. The alternative is being forced to cancel her trip, which could potentially lose her whatever support she's managed to muster among her frontier followers.

As always, stay tuned to GalNet for more information as it becomes available.


* Old World Resurgence in Diso
The newest rejuvenation project to hit the Old Worlds has been announced, and this time it's the Green Party of Diso who have stepped up to the challenge of making its home a pleasant (and profitable) place to live.

As most traders are well aware, Diso is famous for its Diso Ma Corn. A hearty, healthy, tasty plant, this covers itself in a light dust which when snorted produces an intense but brief feeling of contentment and wellbeing. Currently, Diso Ma Corn can only be (cost-effectively) grown on the planet of Birmingham. This is due to a unique collection of nutrients found in the planet's soil, combined with the near-constant bombardment of the planet by solar waves being ejected from Diso itself.

Now the Green Party of Diso is hoping to capitalise on its unique cash crop by increasing the output of Birmingham's Ma Corn plantations. To do that, the Green Party has placed orders to the tune of 15 million tonnes worth of Machinery, in particular the Green Party are interest in purchasing a large quantity of  Atmospheric Processors, Crop Harvesters, Power Generators and Water Purifiers.

In order to earn personal bonuses you must sign up as an active participant before selling Machinery to The Diso Green Party. Only Atmospheric Processors, Crop Harvesters, Power Generators and Water Purifiers sold after signing up will be counted towards your personal contribution total.


* President Halsey Refuses Shadow President's Request
The office of President Jasmina Halsey has today issued a statement refusing Shadow President Hudson's demand to meet him for a live presidential debate on 'Face the People'.

James Speakes, the President's Press Secretary, had this to say on the matter:

« The President is of course happy to debate the Shadow President on policy. President Halsey welcomes any opportunity to talk about the many wonderful programmes she's instigated since taking office. Sadly in this instance, prior engagements keep her from being able to attend such a debate. »

« As President of the Federation, Jasmina Halsey's schedule is booked months in advance. Clearing her entire schedule for the next two weeks simply to take part in a debate against the Shadow President is not something that the President felt that she could do. If Shadow President Hudson still wishes to debate President Halsey when she returns from her trip, then the President will be more than happy to oblige him. »


* 78 Ursae Majoris Reacts to President's Intended Visit
Following the rather strange announcement that President Halsey will soon be visiting the ex-Federal system of 78 Ursae Majoris, GalNet reached out to local leaders and residents to get their thoughts.

« I think it's excellent that President Halsey is finally showing some interest in what's happening in the region. It's a shame she won't be swinging by Townshend, I'm sure my constituents have plenty they want to say to her about the years of neglect the system suffered under Federal rule. »

Andrew Bailey, Mayor of Townshend Hub \u2013 Alioth Independents

« The people of 78 Ursae Majoris have made their feelings about the years of neglect very clear. That is now behind us. I say if President Halsey wishes to make amends, then it is very decent of her to come here and do so in person. Let bygones be bygones. We in the 78 Ursae Majoris for Equality Party are looking forward to the President's visit, and we hope that it will prove to be a productive experience for the residents of Seddon Gateway. »

Mary Silverstein, Seddon Gateway - Chair of 78 Ursae Majoris for Equality Party

« I thought the Lughnatics murdered Halsey? She's coming 'ere, you say? Why? I thought we were pretty clear, !*#@ the Feds, we don't want 'em. Well... 'ere's 'oping no one gets any bright ideas about finishing 'er off, this place was just finally startin' ta sort itself out. »

Gryph Jones, 78 Ursae Majoris B 3 - Farmer


* The Alliance Supports Five a Day in Diso!
On Friday the Green Party of Diso announced their plans to rejuvenate the failing financial fortunes of Birmingham. The news was well received by independent traders from across the galaxy, many of whom immediately made their way to Diso to help ship Machinery for the Green Party of Diso.

In total 5187 Commanders signed up to assist with the rejuvenation project, and together they managed to deliver a staggering 15,010,547 tonnes of Machinery to Diso over the course of just 65 hours. In particular, the Green Party of Diso would like to thank Broker Mrozak, Broker HawX, Tycoon Ace Rimzy, Tycoon Thalios Abraxas and Broker Del Boy for their outstanding efforts to stimulate Birmingham's economy.

As promised, an increased supply of Diso Ma Corn has now been released to the markets aboard Shifnalport. It is hoped that the extra corn supply will not only help to rejuvenate Diso's economy, but that it will also help to encourage economic growth throughout the entire Old World sector.


* The Doom That Comes To Quivira
For the last week Civil War has ravaged the independent nation of Quivira.

Quivira Electronics Plc, acting under orders of Senator Denton Patreus, launched an all out attack on the People's Quivira for Equality Party, leading to fierce fighting between the two parties in the skies above Godel and Stapledon Docks.

The People's Quivira for Equality Party managed to successfully evacuate millions of refugees to the nearby systems of Summerland and Persephone. In particular, the People's Quivira for Equality Party would like to thank Commanders Maclolie, Tavok, Reliant, Morningstar and Aydro for holding the line long enough for the innocent residents of Quivira to escape.

Unfortunately for those left behind, it appears that Senator Patreus is not quite done with Quivira. Reports from the region indicate that several Imperial Majestic class Interdictors have been spotted entering Quivira's airspace. According to sources close to the situation, Senator Patreus now intends to make an example of the defiant nation of Quivira by driving all Independent influences out of the system.


* Prism Senator Denies Power Play
Senator Kahina Tijani Loren was seen at a musical soiree on Capitol yesterday evening, taking part in a reception after her arrival in the Achenar system.

Kahina was ambushed by reporters as she emerged from her transport and asked whether she was intending to challenge for the leadership of the Empire.

She responded that she had « absolutely no ambitions in that direction whatsoever. »

Asked whether she would support Senator Patreus or Senator Lavigny's bid for leadership, she replied that they both had « genuine claims to the throne. »

Speculation has not died down as a result. Pundits have been debating whether these seemingly straightforward answers are hiding a bigger agenda.

Kazien Vantris, chief editor of the Imperial Herald, commented in his editorial - « The first rule of vying for power? Deny everything. By not directly supporting anyone she's clearly keeping her options open. Quite why that is remains to be seen. We'll leave that to the forums to decide. »


* The Sinner, the Saint and the Saviour
Two days ago, Senator Denton Patreus officially declared War on the impoverished system of Quivira. Thousands of vessels loyal to Patreus have been pouring into Quivira ever since, bringing death and destruction to any non-Imperial ships that they find.

Fortunately, most of Quivira's residents had already been successfully evacuated to nearby systems. This is in no small part thanks to the efforts of Independent and Federal Commanders working to thwart Senator Patreus's plans for Quivira.

While the Senator begins to carve up the system for his followers, other members of the Imperial court appear to be seriously concerned about the millions of displaced civilians who now find themselves lost, angry, but not quite alone in Imperial space. In an effort to soothe the situation, both Aisling Duval and Arissa Lavigny-Duval have set up campaigns aimed at helping the refugees get back on their feet.

Citizens willing to aid the Princesses in their endeavours can sign up to help Aisling's agents at Henry O'Hare's Hanger in Summerland. Similarly, Arissa's agents can be found working aboard Lambardelli's Legacy in Persephone.


* President Halsey Sets Out from Sol
The crowds were out in force on Mars today, as residents gathered to watch the presidential battlecruiser, Space Flight One, depart on the start of President Halsey's tour of Federal frontier systems.

For security reasons, the exact details of the President's itinerary are being kept secret. However, GalNet has been given permission to exclusively reveal the names of a dozen systems that President Halsey intends to visit during her trip. Those being:

Hip 53688, Tinia, Aleumoxii, 78 Ursae Majoris, Dietri, Su, Furuhjelm I-645, Saga, Delphin, Nanomam, Coriccha and Ross 860.

As Vice President Naylor will be accompanying President Halsey on her trip, the Secretary of State, Madam Winters, will be overseeing day-to-day operations on Mars during the President's absence.


* Unrest on the Frontier
New reports from the frontier suggest that a horde of militant nomads is currently sweeping their way through the Pegasi Sector. The group, who call themselves the Kumo Crew, are led by the vicious Warlord Archon Delaine.

A talented tactician, and a brutal fighter, Archon famously assumed leadership of the Kumo Crew at the tender age of 15 after violently beating the previous leader to death during a clan moot.

So far, the Kumo Crew have shown no interest in taking direct control over any of the regions they've plundered. Instead, they've taken to sending regular raiding parties to collect tithes on behalf of the Crew. Systems who agree to their demands are spared, while those who refuse are burnt to the ground.

All attempts to stop the spread of the crew throughout the Pegasi Sector have so far met with failure. The Kumo Crew are described as being well armed, psychotic and thus extremely dangerous.


* 78 Ursae Majoris Increases Security Ahead of Presidential Visit
Excitement is in the air in 78 Ursae Majoris, as millions of residents have begun preparing Seddon Gateway for the arrival of Federal President Jasmina Halsey. The exact date of the President's arrival has yet to be announced, but residents haven't let that stop them from arranging a week of festivities and cultural displays aboard the station.

Another group preparing for the President's visit is the Alioth Independents, who have today announced that they will be launching an initiative to increase security in the local cluster ahead of President Halsey's visit.

Andrew Bailey, the Mayor of Townsend Hub and local leader of the Alioth Independents had this to say about the new initiative:

« We are very conscious that once President Halsey arrives, the whole galaxy will have its eyes on our little system. 78 Ursae Majoris has been nothing but peaceful and productive since electing to join the Alliance and the Alioth Independents will do everything in our power to ensure it remains that way throughout the President's visit. »

« Firstly, we will be running a cluster wide security campaign from Townsend Hub. As part of which, agents of the Alioth Independents will be offering a range of bonuses to bounty hunters who help clear out any unruly criminal elements in the sector. »

« Secondly, members of the Alioth Independents and our allies will be launching a military campaign to finally rid the cluster of the criminal cartel known as the Sobek Boys. Military capable Commanders interested in assisting with the campaign can likewise signup for active duty aboard Townsend Hub. »


* Sol Unplugged?
For the first time in almost a decade, Utopixx Entertainment, the subsidiary of Reynhardt Intellisys responsible for some of the top virtual reality experiences in the galaxy, has posted an operating loss of almost 5,000,000,000,000 credits.

Investors were shocked by the news, which saw Reynhardt Intellisys shares drop by almost 14%.

Reynhardt Intellisys has issued the following statement in an attempt to explain the drastic change in profits:

« Overall, uptake of Utopixx products in Independent, Alliance and Imperial markets remains strong. We continue to see a yearly growth rate of between 1 and 2% per sector, which in many cases means that we are exceeding our targets. »

« The losses posted for this year are partly due to the construction of a completely new and extremely exciting line of VR-Streams, which includes the latest instalment in the popular CQC franchise. »

« In-sim purchases within Federal markets have fallen below expected levels, but an analysis of the market suggests that such losses are part of a general downward trend that appears to be affecting a wide range of media companies operating in Federal systems. The cause of this drop-off in purchases remains unclear at this time. »


* Upgrade of Parkinson Dock Complete
After two weeks of frantic construction, which saw close to 70,000 engineers working around the clock to get the project finished in time, Parkinson Dock is now home to some of the most advanced factories in the entire Empire.

The upgrade was completed as part of Senator Patreus's plan to increase economic opportunities for the residents of his home system. 2,267 Commanders helped ship a total of 8,274,504 tonnes of industrial materials to Parkinson Dock, all of which were put to good use during the construction effort.

In particular, the Eotienses Citizens' Forum would like to honour Viscount Plo Koon, Baron Coiling Dragon, Earl Prawnetto, Earl Morton and Baron Kosmetas for their assistance in refitting Parkinson Dock in preparation for its new role as a dedicated research and development hub for new military technologies.


* Kahina Refuses to Commit to Factions or Future
Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, currently residing as a guest on Capital at the request of Chancellor Blaine, remains completely ambivalent to inquiries into her intentions. She has airily dismissed questions regarding her purpose or what was said to her at the reception to which she was summoned and continues to ignore requests from the press.

Now there appears to be another name in the frame. Cuthrick Delaney, ambassador to the Prism system, has had a long and varied career within the Empire, first coming to prominence during the events which ended the dictatorship of Dr. Walden on the Old World planet of Lave. His precise involvement in that event was unclear, and he seems to have lost none of his ability to stay close to those with power in the intervening time. He has been seen in conversation with Kahina on many occasions.

There is considerable conjecture as to what stance Kahina will take. Many have stated that her aggressive tendencies will align her to Senator Patreus. Others have pointed out her support for traditional Imperial slavery, and her distant family connection to the Duvals, indicates an allegiance with Senator Torval is more likely

It would appear that only Kahina, and perhaps Cuthrick Delaney, actually know.

In other news, the Senator's ship was confirmed to have had some significant modifications made to it recently, including a state of the art fuel scoop and a custom built Gutamaya discovery scanner.


* Federation Accused of Cover-up
Despite pleas for information from the Scientific cross-faction coalition, the Federal Authorities remain tight lipped. According to sources close to Dr. Arcanonn and his team, Halsey's government have refused to even acknowledge that Federation ships have been transporting the artefacts through populated space, despite mounting evidence. The authorities have also been accused of providing the scientist with nothing more than cryptic responses designed to stall their investigations.

Dr. Arcanonn is quoted as saying: \This information blackout is outrageous, they have to understand that they have no right to withhold this information. I would ask all humans, no matter their allegiance, to contemplate the existence of these objects and their meaning. I would also ask them to contemplate why the other major powers are not so much as passing the slightest comment on this. What are they hiding?\

\Some members of our community are done with waiting to be fed lies, simply to allow the Federation to perhaps continue to acquire some perceived military advantage. If no information is forthcoming immediately I cannot be held responsible for the consequences.\

When asked to clarify exactly what this implied, Dr. Arcanonn declined to comment further.

In a possibly related development reports suggest some Federation convoys are being shadowed by groups of unidentified combat ships.


* Soontill Relics Test Results Queried
As further alien artefacts claiming to be from Soontill are being sold on the open market, the results of the initial scientific tests have been revealed.

« We were looking for key markers, » explains Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar.  « Elemental make up, crystalline structure, anything that indicates it could have originated from human hand. »

And the results? Inconclusive. The research team's results clearly state that no known human technology could have created the relics, yet they do not quite align with known Thargoid materials. Whatever they are, they are indeed very old, with isotopic dating indicating that they could well be tens of thousands of years old.

Jean Molyneaux, a historian from France, Earth, suggests we look back at our own past to determine the home of these relics.  « Imagine an alien travelling back two thousand years into mankind's past.  The varied culture, arts and building materials of the Aztecs, Greeks, the Shang dynasty, what have you, the alien could think they were all different species, if that was his way of thinking\u2026 »

The community seems wary of awarding these artefacts any title yet, given the fifty years of false hopes since Soontill was first mentioned by the Thargoids. However, reports indicate that these relics have now arrived at labs on both Mars and Capitol for further testing, and with any luck, we may soon finally agree on what these relics are, or are not.


* Quivira Honours the People's Princess
Over the last week, Imperial forces loyal to Senator Patreus continued their assault on Quivira, and due to their efforts, Quivira Electronics Plc was finally able to secure control over Godel Dock early on Monday afternoon.

Despite being abandoned by their supposed saviours, the People's Quivira for Equality Party were able to find some small respite from the war in the Summerlands. Thanks to the efforts of Aisling Duval and her 'angels', refugees from the People's Quivira for Equality Party found themselves well cared for in the Summerlands, even as their counterparts in Persephone and Quivira continued to suffer.

Now that the war is over, the People's Quivira for Equality Party has elected to pledge itself to Aisling's service. In recognition of that fact, Senator Patreus has promised that only residents of Quivira who have directly broken Imperial law will be held responsible for the debt incurred by the previous administration. Members of the People's Quivira for Equality Party who have sworn themselves to Aisling are expected to start returning to their homes over the next few days.


* Quivirans Defy Doom
The war-torn region of Quivira has finally settled into an uneasy peace, following an intense period of fighting which saw hundreds of thousands dead and several billion credits worth of damage done to the local economy.

Initially the situation looked promising for the People's Quivira for Equality Party. Independent and Federal Commanders flocked from all across the galaxy in an attempt to repel Senator Denton Patreus's attempts to extract the debts owed to him by the Quiviran government. Early attempts at repelling the Senator's mercenary forces proved to be a success, and the freedom fighters were able to buy enough time for the People's Quivira for Equality Party to evacuate a great many innocent civilians to neighbouring systems.

Unfortunately, once the Party's credits ran out, so too did the support of Independent and Federal pilots.


* Anti-Federation Terrorists Linked to Artefact Research
Over the course of the weekend hundreds of tons of Bio-Waste were dumped in and around stations in 78 Ursae Majoris. This system is currently undergoing preparations for President Halsey's arrival as part of her planned grand tour. A group calling themselves 'The Canonn' claims responsibility for this act.

An anonymous spokesperson told GalNet that they are \a movement of like-minded Commanders seeking the truth about the recently discovered 'Unknown Artefacts'.\ They state that they are \prepared to use whatever levers are at their disposal to increase the political pressure on the Federation government to force them to come clean.\ The spokesperson echoed growing fears that the artefacts could be some new weapon of mass destruction.

Parallels were immediately drawn to Dr. Arcanonn and his recent demands to the Federation government following research into the Unknown Artefacts discovered to be transported in Federation convoys. We asked Arcanonn if he was connected to this terrorist group. He denied any responsibility for the group's actions but declined to answer any further questions on the subject of his potential involvement.

However he did go on to say:

 \It is clear that we are not the only ones who are growing tired of the Federation's cover-up over these artefacts and some Commanders would seem to be taking more direct action. Obviously, I do not condone such methods but I can certainly sympathise with their frustration.\

\In the spirit of seeking to put an end to these disruptive acts I urge all citizens, Federation, Alliance and Empire alike, to petition your government to make public any information that they have on the origin and nature of these objects before these demonstrations escalate. I also appeal to Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar to contact me so that we can pool our resources and research into these potentially related items, in the search for answers for the common good of all humanity.\


* Pilot Breaks Galactic Record Twice
The accomplishments of independent pilots participating in the Buckyball Run A* rally race continue to make headlines around civilized space. This 26,000 light year rally race to the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy has so far attracted over 40 fearless competitors. One of these competitors, Commander Alot, has made a name for himself by beating the galactic record for the quickest run twice in less than a month.

Alot's current time to reach Sagittarius A*, an incredible 9 hours 39 minutes, was accomplished aboard a Faulcon DeLacy Anaconda named 'Rhonda'. In comparison, his previous record-breaking attempt was done in 11 hours 46 minutes using a Lakon Spaceways Asp called the 'Big Bird'.

When asked for a statement, Alot answered philosophically:

« Nothing lasts forever. I'm quite sure that in time my record will be beaten. In fact, I've already heard of several skilled pilots planning their next attempts, and I wish them the best of luck. »

At the time of broadcast, Commander Kligg has already taken the lead, passing Commander Alot by a mere 8 minutes, using an Anaconda named the 'Rub Tub'. However, Kligg himself speculated in a short statement that it was only a matter of time before Alot climbs back to the first position.

* Aisling Opens Art Installation on Emerald
The People's Princess made an appearance in Cemiess late last night to attend the opening of Emerald's newest art installation, 'Prism's Shades', a multi-sensory experience that uses experimental light and sound projection technology to stimulate a series of empathic responses from its audience.

Aisling dazzled crowds by dressing in a long-sleeved ruby red evening gown, adorned with painite sparkles. She accessorised with an equally stunning tinted visor, fashionably stamped with Aisling's personal crest.

Surprisingly, the people's princess only stayed at the installation for a little over an hour. Aisling left the show long before midnight, citing exhaustion from her recent activities in the Summerlands as the reason behind her early exit.


* Arissa Addresses Problems in Persephone
Speaking from the site of her new palace on Kamadhenu, Princess Lavigny-Duval today addressed the recent problems faced by residents of Persephone in the face of a plague outbreak which was brought to the system by the refugees from Quivira.

« I understand the concerns of the citizens of Persephone, and I am sorry for their plight. However, the illness affecting the refugees, many of whom are malnourished and woefully lax in terms of adequate vaccination cover, is not something that should concern the locals. »

« Of more concern to locals should be the increase in pirate activity, which I have been reliably informed is up by almost 600% since Patreus decided to start throwing his weight around. »

« The people of Quivira certainly need help, but it is their patron's responsibility to help them, not mine. I'm sure Aisling is more than capable of handling this problem herself. However, if she wishes for my help I will of course be happy to oblige. We are family, after all. »


* Extraordinary Transmission Contesting Dr Arcanonn
After recent terrorist activities in 78 Ursae Majoris, GalNet received multiple reports about a single transmission regarding Dr Arcanonn, that has been broadcast via various radio stations throughout known inhabited space simultaneously without their approval.

GalNet was provided with a recording of the audio message:

« It doesn't matter who I am. My message is clear and simple. You have all been deceived by a charismatic individual calling himself a scientist, full of misled ambitions, going by the name of Dr Arcanonn. He is taking advantage of the picture in your head of him being peaceful and reasonable for the greater good, but your support is being utilized and shamefully exploited. But who am I to trust? What do my words of prudence, my voice of sanity matter? »

« Just look at his last statement, indirectly acknowledging terrorism, clearly showing that he is willing to do everything to achieve his own goals. »

The voice goes on, describing the researcher's various unsafe attempts to solve the artefact's secrets and describing the Doctor's demands for information as a masked attempt to sow the seeds of discord between them. The message closes with a call to stop the group's support:

« Don't let yourself be fooled. Open your eyes and see the clear truth unfolded in front of you. I'm asking for your sanity! Don't let history repeat itself! Remember! »

It is still unknown how the coordinated transmission was achieved, as it presents a serious effort.

The respective station owners are also researching how that broadcast was routed into their programmes and deny any previous knowledge or even support to allow this transmission.


* Securing the Borders in the Ceti Sector
The return of Onionhead to Panem may be a blessing for the farmers of Kappa Fornacis, but for their neighbours, the Fornacian dream has turned into a living nightmare.

« It's not right, » one concerned resident of the nearby BD-18 394 system told GalNet. « Sure, they're doing alright over there in Kappa F, but what about us? What do we get? I'll tell you, smugglers and pirates, that's what. »

Crime has spiralled out of control throughout the Ceti Sector, with many locals echoing the sentiment that the Farmers Union of Kappa Fornacis should be held responsible for attracting such unsavoury characters to what was once a peaceful area.

In an attempt to clean up the sector, the Independent Autahenetsi Labour Party are currently offering a range of bonus payments to any Bounty Hunters who sign up to act as Federal Ceti Sector Security Services Agents at Artyukhin Ring in Autahenetsi.


* Terrorism Claims Against Wolzan and the Shadow Navy Denounced by Crimson Fortune Company
Ellie Blossum, The CEO of the Crimson Fortune Company, has today issued a statement regarding the recent unrest in Liaedin.

\As many of you know, the Federation's influence in Liaedin has come under attack in recent months, despite many years of peace between the Blossum and the Faveol families. »

« We believe that this destabilisation effort was a deliberate act of malice, intended to encourage certain unruly members of the Faveol family to attempt to expand beyond the borders of Liaedin, as evidenced by the recent attack on Volungu. »

« The Crimson Fortune Company would like to thank Commander Wolzan and the Shadow Navy for their efforts to keep the Liaedin system in a fair balance of power. We would also like to thank the many Federal pilots who came to our aid during the blockade of Liaedin last weekend. Without your diligence, we are certain that enemies of the Federation would even now be using Liaedin as a staging area for their illegal expansionist agenda. »


* Federal State of Emergency: Winters Declared Acting President
At 15:00 hours universal galactic time on 26th May 3301, Secretary of State Felicia Winters assumed the role of Acting President of the Federation in the wake of the disappearance of Spaceflight One.

Speaking in an emergency broadcast to the nation, Acting President Winters had this to say:

« It is with deep regret and some trepidation that I must come before you today to announce that contact with the President's ship, Spaceflight One, has been lost. »

« Two days ago, Navy Command received word that the President would be taking an unscheduled detour to Azaleach. Her reasons as to why remain classified. »

« 12 hours ago, following entry into hyperspace, Spaceflight One went dark. All attempts by the President's security team to trace the vessel have met with failure. »

« Squadrons have been scrambled in an attempt to find President Halsey and Vice President Naylor, and I have faith that the Navy will do everything they can to bring them home. »

« That said, in order to maintain a clear chain of command during this time of crisis, I will be assuming the role of Acting President of the Federation effective immediately. I hope I have your support, and I hope it will only have to be a temporary measure. »


* President Misses Meeting
Reports coming in from Saga indicate that the President has missed her scheduled meeting with delegates aboard Zudov Terminal. Maisy Stevenson, the leader of the Saga Republic Party, expressed her concern to GalNet in the following statement:

« We were expecting Starflight One to arrive a little under 38 hours ago. An escort was sent to meet Starflight One at the prearranged location, but the ship simply didn't appear. We informed Mars and were told that the President had decided to take a last-minute detour. »

« I understand the President's time is precious, but it would have been nice to get a little bit of advance notice. The people of Saga spent a not inconsiderable amount of time and credits preparing to greet the President, and now their hard work appears to have gone to waste. I do hope that the President manages to find time for us in her seemingly busy schedule. I would hate to think that the people of Saga had in some way been snubbed by Halsey. »


* Shades of the Antares Incident
At a press conference held earlier today, Acting Federal President Felicia Winters made a personal appearance to address the rdisappearance of Starship One after failing to re-enter normal space following a routine hyperspace jump.

« The disappearance of Starship One has us all on edge. Tensions are high, and the rumour mills are making all their usual noise about terrorists, aliens, conspiracies and cover-ups. I'm afraid the truth will likely get you all far fewer viewers, but it is the truth that the people of the Federation need to hear from me now. »

« I'm told the early investigations from telemetry and uplink data suggest an explosive drive failure destroyed Starship One in hyperspace, catapulting all three of her protective Guardian Wing out of hyperspace. Wreckage is likely spread across interstellar space. I'm told there are parallels with the loss of the Highliner Antares way back in 3251 when she was lost with all hands on her maiden voyage. »

« I know I remember where I was when the Highliner Antares disappeared, and I fear we will always remember where we were the day Starship One was lost. »

« While we don't know what caused this incident \u2013 yet \u2013 we do know that Starship One's engines experienced an unexpected surge of power just seconds before making its last jump. »

« The search efforts will continue, of course. Our hearts and hope go out to the friends and families of President Halsey and all those lost yesterday in this terrible incident. »


* Federal Search Efforts Continue
It has been almost 48 hours since the disappearance of Starship One. Early reports indicated that the ship was lost with all hands, and in this instance GalNet is pleased to announce that the early reports were mistaken. Three ships from Starship One's Guardian Wing made contact with Navy HQ shortly after the initial disappearance. Unfortunately, they were not able to shed any light on the ultimate fate of Starship One.

Despite thousands of Federal scouts combing the sectors along Starship One's secured route, designated Spaceflight One, no trace of the missing ship has been found.

Specialist teams from Core Dynamics and the Sirius Corporation are currently attempting to analyse the wake and uplink data captured by the President's Guardian Wing escorts in the moments before all four ships jumped. Theories involve either a rare misjump or some sort of catastrophic drive failure.  Unfortunately, results so far are inconclusive as to what may have happened to President Halsey and her team.

One member of the crew of one of the President's Guardian Wing, who wished to remain nameless, spoke exclusively to GalNet about the last moments before the President's disappearance.

« I've never seen anything like it. One minute everything was fine. Pre-jump checks? Normal. Engine power? Normal. Our drives were slaved to Starship One, as is normal. The entry to hyperspace seemed normal at first, but then there was a terrible shock wave and our ship started tumbling. We exited hyperspace uncontrolled and in deep space \u2013 something I've never seen before. Our ship had taken damage. We couldn't reach Starship One via comms, but managed to make contact with the other two members of the Guardian Wing. We first searched the deep space around our positions, then jumped to the destination point rendezvous as quickly as we could. Nothing. Not even wreckage.  »

The Federal Navy are requesting that any pilots interested in helping to search along the Starflight One route should sign up for active duty as a member of the search and rescue team aboard Leoniceno Orbital in Azaleach.


* Emergency Session of Congress
Shadow President Hudson today called an Emergency Session of Congress to address concerns surrounding Starship One's disappearance.

During the meeting, the Shadow President openly mocked the idea that Starship One's disappearance could have been caused by simple engine failure.

« Jasmina and I weren't close \u2013 heck, we hated each other, and that's the truth of it. But the idea, the very notion, that our best and brightest out there on Starship One would have let that bird fly with a busted engine... No way. Those guys are military. We need to be looking for who did it. We need to nail them NOW. The assassin is busy covering their tracks while we speak. This dithering inaction and woolly thinking is typical of this administration. Let's face it Halsey had enough enemies like those onionhead guys, numerous frontier systems she has annoyed, and the elephant in the room \u2013 the Empire. »

Acting President Winters took a more levelled approach.

« I appreciate the sheer gamut of emotions my esteemed colleague must be feeling, but at times like these, level heads must prevail. We have found no evidence of foul play as yet.  Our engineers are sifting through copious amounts of data and so far it does look like a very unusual catastrophic failure rather than sabotage. »


* The Truth is Out There
Despite claims that the disappearance of Starship One was due to a failure in the ship's Frame Shift Drive, rumours abound about a more sinister, possibly extraterrestrial explanation.

Alex Snoori, host of the popular interstellar talk show Beyond Top Secret, had this to say to his listeners.

« It's an outrage, that's what it is. Do you think those Martian fat cats that rule over us want you to know the truth? I don't think so. »

« Learn your history, people. It wasn't all that long ago that our ancestors were being plucked out of the black right into the belly of bugs. Wake up sheeple, you don't want to be sitting around dressed up like mutton when they come for you. Do not let the government tell you lies. You're smarter than that. »

« There's been a lot of hullabaloo about strange things being found out there recently. Weird, pulsing, alien things. I don't know where they came from, but I do know that they're creepy, and gross, and almost certainly dangerous. You think it's a coincidence that the President went missing just weeks after those THINGS turn up? Don't be so naive. WAKE UP sheeple, you're being lied to. »


* Winters Willingly Agrees to Vote
Following Shadow President Zachary Hudson's call to have Congress issue a Vote of No Confidence against President Jasmina Halsey, Acting President Felicia Winters held a press conference outside Congress to address the Shadow President's concerns about the future.

« Let me start by saying how truly saddened I am by the loss of my long time friend, Jasmina. I know that were she here instead of me, she would be deeply disappointed with the fear-mongering being bandied about by members of the opposition. Nevertheless we have to bow to process. »

« In order to allow a right and proper number of representatives from the frontier worlds to attend, Congress will meet on Monday to formally vote on the future of the Federation. Should I be chosen to continue to serve, I promise that you will get the kind of president that you deserve. »


* Hudson Calls for Vote of No Confidence
Shadow President Zachary Hudson has continued his criticism of Halsey's administration, finally moving to the feared vote of no confidence. In his address to Congress, Shadow President Hudson has made it clear the situation needs a resolution.

« These are uncertain times and, with no disrespect to Jasmina's memory, we need to put an end to this weak administration and bring our beloved Federation back on track. We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of wallowing in this state of horrendous disarray for even a moment longer. »

« Had Jasmina returned, it would have made no difference. She was away trying to raise support from the frontier as she knew this vote of no confidence was coming. I call for it now. Let's get it out of the way and move on, here on Mars and throughout the Federation. »

« We are not some Imperial dynasty. We do not allow the whims of our dead to dictate terms to the living. »

« As such, in her absence, and without any ill intent towards Secretary Winters, I am issuing a call for a vote of no confidence against the current administration. »


* Malfunction or Malice?
It has now been 5 days since Starship One lost contact, and the search and rescue teams have yet to find any trace of the missing ship or her crew.

According to Lieutenant Barringer of the Federal Transport Safety Administration:

« Starship One's disappearance appears to have been caused by a major malfunction in the Frame Shift Drive's safety systems. It looks like there was a major power surge, followed by four separate system failures in quick succession according to the data we have, resulting in a catastrophic explosion. We do not believe this explosion would have been survivable by anyone on board. »

« The FTSA has seen each of these failures in commercial and military hyperdrives in the last few years, but each one has resulted in the drive shutting down and the ship failing to enter hyperspace.

« There are strong similarities with the loss of the Highliner Antares in 3251, but since then we have many more safety systems designed to prevent such failures. At the moment it looks like this was a terribly unlucky tragic accident. We have not found any evidence of tampering, and all the systems passed their automated pre-flight checks. »

« Our condolences go out to the loved ones of those lost. »


* A Vote of Congressional Confidence
There is blood in the water and the politicians have begun hunting their prey.

Yesterday, Shadow President Hudson placed a motion before Congress asking that they issue a Vote of No Confidence against President Halsey's administration. The motion was accepted, and the vote has been scheduled to take place on Monday afternoon.

According to historic procedure, if a Vote of No Confidence in the encumbent President succeeds, then the Shadow President gets the chance to form an administration, which in turn is then put to a vote. If this fails, then a full congressional election is triggered.

The Shadow President succeeding in these circumstances is not unheard of, but pretty rare. The last occasion was when the increasingly unpopular Eugene Cooper was ousted by the charismatic Antonia Madison in 3264 following a mid-term Vote of No Confidence.


* 78 Ursae Majoris Celebrates Security with Shield Sale
After a series of skirmishes between independent pilots and pirates, as well as the drawn out battle against the Sobek Boys, 78 Ursae Majoris was facing a security threat in the run-up to Federal President Jasmina Halsey's planned visit. News of the catastrophic accident that is believed to have consumed Starship One, and taken the President's life, has been spreading through the galaxy, but 78 Ursae Majoris has now been secured.

The system saw a huge influx of independent pilots as Andrew Bailey, Mayor of Townshend Hub and local leader of the Alioth Independents, declared the security and military campaign. Independent pilots were tasked with eradicating criminal elements in and around Alliance territory, along with being enlisted in a military campaign against the Sobek Boys, a criminal syndicate operating from the Sobek system. There was a lull in fighting the Sobek Boys however, as the objective took a few days to actually reach a completion mark. Some might think there might be more behind as to why this objective wasn't touched in the starting days. Ivan Shevchenko, a known mercenary and fighter pilot, has given us his opinion on the matter:

\There is a large difference between fighting traditional asteroid belt pirates, and a well organized militia force. And that isn't something I say lightly, having been in the conflict areas. The Sobek Boys' ships were well armed and heavily reinforced. A whole gang of pirates running around with that kind of gear is bad for any system or region of space. But that could also be the reason as to why nobody was really wanting to fight them. Nobody wants to be tangled up against that kind of firepower, even I don't and I own one of the best bounty hunting vessels you can get. On the other hand, independent pilots could've also been distracted by the other directive Mayor Bailey put out to stopping pirate activity. At the same time though I have to say, who knows. I suppose in the end though, all of us who helped put a stop to the Sobek Boys and pirate activities in and around 78 Ursae Majoris did a very good thing for the Alliance and its members.\

- CMDR Shevchenko


* Federal Congress Prepares for Vote
Members of Congress from across the Federation have made their way to Mars today, in response to Shadow President Hudson's call for a Vote of No Confidence Against the current administration.

For months now, the Shadow President has been involved in an intense lobbying campaign against President Halsey and her administration. The Shadow President has pointed to the loss of dozens of member states to the Alliance, a rampant increase in crime rates, and a defanged Federal Navy as some of the more devastating effects of Jasmina's time in office.

However, now that President Halsey no longer appears to be a concern, Congress could decide to allow Acting President Winters to assume the office of President in Jasmina's stead. Felicia Winters has always been very popular amongst Congress, even before her ascension to the office of Secretary of State. Now that she's assumed the role of Acting President, it's could be possible that her peers will elect to see what kind of leader Felicia will be.

Members of Congress will be permitted to cast their vote at any time in the next 12 hours. Last-minute lobbying efforts from both sides are expected to be extremely intense, although pundits believe that Shadow President Zachary Hudson will almost certainly carry the day.


* Zachary Hudson Becomes the New President of the Federation
The results are in and Zachary Hudson is the overwhelming choice for the new President of the Federation.

A record number of attendees appeared in Congress on Mars to take part in yesterday's Vote of No Confidence against the Liberal Administration, with almost every member of Congress appearing in person to cast their vote.

In the end, a shocking 66% of Congress voted to remove the Liberal Administration from office, a clear indicator that the collected Federal worlds feel a change in leadership style is necessary. Surprisingly, a large number of known Liberal supporters voted to remove their own leadership from power. Most commentators agree that this is a reflection on Halsey's actions and the current unpopularity of Federal government among frontier systems. Winters needs to build her own supporter base before she can bring power back to the Liberals.

President Hudson will be officially sworn into office later today, after which he is expected to spend the remainder of the week finalising his administration. Most of the previous Shadow Cabinet are expected to be included, although as always some change is inevitable.

The Federal Republican Association has gained a massive swell of support over the last year. Now that President Hudson is officially in office, we can expect a much more aggressive stance on decision-making coming from Mars once the new administration is fully established.


* The Loss of Starship One Linked to Mechanical Failure
The Federal Navy has today released its official report into the disappearance of Starship One. As expected, the 600,000 word document provides a detailed analysis of the inner workings of Starship One.

The report confirms that the abnormal energy signature detected by Guardian Wing Alpha, immediately prior to Starship One's last known jump, was almost certainly caused by mechanical failure. The report includes an in depth comparison with the failure of the Highliner Antares and concludes there were remarkable similarities in the unusual failure mode, and it is still unclear why the automatic shutdown systems did not operate (most of which were not present on the Antares). The failure began with a power surge in the central power plant \u2013 something not especially unusual in a high capacity hydrogen reactor \u2013 causing several other core systems to overload.

Despite going over hours of evidence, including video feeds detailing the last several days of life aboard all four ships of Starflight One, investigators were not able to identify any signs of foul play. In the end, the team has concluded that the cause of Starship One's loss was a complex multi-stage engine failure.


* Galaxy's Most Wanted: Who is Archon Delaine?
Villain, murderer, madman. Titles with which Archon Delaine, the self-styled Pirate King, are all too familiar.

37 years ago, Archon Delaine rose to prominence after brutally beating the Kumo Crew's previous leader to death with his bare hands. Thus, at the tender age of 15, Archon assumed the role of Pirate Lord and began to cut a bloody swathe across the Pegasi sector.

During the first 20 years of his rule, Archon Delaine faced a constant stream of challenges from upstarts and other crews alike. Each and every challenger was struck down, and as each one fell, the legend of Archon grew ever greater.

Growing weary of the constant infighting, Archon oversaw a massive restructuring of his 'family'. He turned them from a loosely affiliated rag-tag assortment of pirate crews into a single-minded killing machine whose only desire is to obey Archon's every order. Under his leadership, the Kumo Crew has gone from being a feared local drug cartel to one of the most influential criminal syndicates in the galaxy.

The systems he runs still function \u2013 in some cases better than before they were taken. The Kumo Crew rule by fear and are utterly intolerant of those who work against them, but in equal measure have been known to protect and reward those in the systems they have subjugated who have shown loyalty, brutally enforcing their own ruthlessly simple ethos.

So far, Archon Delaine has only been active in the Pegasi sector, but some reports have begun to surface of Kumo Crew members beginning to move out of the sector.


* The Rising Cost of Getting High
The Rising Cost of Getting High \n \nIn reaction to the changing political landscape in the Federation, many systems have begun taking a much firmer stance against the supply and distribution of illegal narcotics.

Traditionally, prohibition has served to do nothing more than increase the risk and reward for those involved in the trade of prohibited materials. This time appears to be no different.

With the supply no longer adequately able to meet the demand, many buyers are being forced to pay prices that would have been unimaginable just weeks ago.

While stricter penalties and additional costs may be enough to dissuade infrequent users, for the vast majority the question of cost is less an issue of if, and more a question of how.

Smugglers across the galaxy have seen their profits rise by as much as 5000% in the last couple of weeks, with many expecting that profits will continue to rise, as more and more systems begin to crack down on the delivery of illicit goods  to their stations.


* Orden de Comandantes Imperiales Capture Kamocan for Princess
Orden de Comandantes Imperiales Capture Kamocan for Princess \n \nThe famous Hispanic chivalric order has been operating day and night to ensure that Kamocan turns its allegiance to Princess Arissa Lavigny-Duval. The noblemen of the Orden de Comandantes Imperiales have been working hard to turn Kamocan to the support of the Princess, and after an extended campaign, the Orden de Comandantes Imperiales is pleased to announce that Kamocan has now officially entered the Imperial fold.

This area of Imperial space is highly populated with people from Hispanic backgrounds, many of whom have now sworn to follow the Princess Lavigny-Duval in her quest to restore law and order to the Empire.

The Orden de Comandantes Imperiales are confident that their systems will prosper through the influence of their beloved leader, the only real heir to the Throne.


* The Dukes of Mikunn Unveil Mercenary's Respite
The Dukes of Mikunn Unveil Mercenary's Respite \n \nThanks to the efforts of the Mercenaries of Mikunn, who were assisted in their endeavour to colonise a previously uninhabited region of space by hundreds of independent commanders, the Dukes of Mikunn are pleased to announce the opening of a new station in the area previously known as COL 285 Sector VG-1 B24-6.

Over 1 million tonnes of metal were collected in Kwatee last month to help construct « Mercenary's Respite, » the Duke's newest Coriolis station. Remoteness from major high-tech hubs and attempts at bureaucratic power plays by the Law Party of HR 7327 are blamed for the delay in opening the Duke's latest military installation.

The Law Party's assistance in constructing the station was initially offered in order to forge a lasting peace with the Dukes as part a cease-fire agreement in regards to HR 7327. Ironically, the Law Party lost an election to the Dukes during the truce, leading to the Dukes gaining control of both HR 7327 and COL 285 Sector VG-1 B24-6.

B24-6, as the locals call it, has been renamed « Sefrys » in honour of a fallen Mercs commander.

The Dukes of Mikunn urge all those who may have business with either the Dukes or the Mercs to contact their agents aboard Mercenary's Respite in order to make the appropriate arrangements.


* Emperor's Grace Reaffirms Loyalty to Patreus
Emperor's Grace Reaffirms Loyalty to Patreus \n \nOn the personal order of Varrwen Mako Brennus, all members of Emperor's Grace are instructed to extend their support to Senator Denton Patreus where possible.

Senator Patreus demonstrated support for Emperor's Grace during recent unpleasant circumstances when senior members of Emperor's Grace stood accused of Treason. This unfounded and scurrilous accusation was disproven before the Imperial Senate. Moreover, Emperor's Grace was instrumental in finding the criminals behind the recent assassination attempt on Emperor Duval.

Explaining the decision to extend support to Senator Patreus, Admiral Brennus declared to a packed audience that \we never forget our friends and we always remember our enemies.\

* Hudson Set to Target Traffickers
Hudson Set to Target Traffickers \n \nIn the face of President Hudson's recent rise to power, the value of illicit goods has skyrocketed throughout the galaxy in anticipation of a crackdown on illegal commodities that are traditionally transported via the Federation. Dealers of all stripes have seen their profits soar over the last week, with hundreds of new millionaires being minted off the back of President Hudson's perceived stance against criminal commodities.

With the President's appointment of his new administration now complete, sources close to Hudson have revealed to GalNet that an increase in security spending is very high on his agenda.

« Things are about to get very difficult for traffickers, » one anonymous aide told the Mars Tribune.

« The President's ordered a bunch of those new Diamondback Scouts to act as short range interceptors for local security services. They don't pack much of a punch on their own, but you try and outrun a swarm of angry Diamondbacks followed up by a couple of Viper wings and see how well you do. »

« 'Course if you do outrun them, say hello to the Navy. A month from now, two months top, the war against drugs will be done and dusted. You mark my words. »

Prices of illegal narcotics had just started to stabilise after a week of frantic black market trading, and this latest news could well send prices spiking up again as dealers across the galaxy try to unload their stash before the expected galaxy-wide lockdown begins.


* The Federation Unites in the Face of Tragedy
The Federation Unites in the Face of Tragedy  \n \nDespite some fear that the recent change in leadership would lead to further destabilisation of the Federation, it seems that on the whole, the majority of Federal worlds are content to wait and see what kind of President Zachary Hudson turns out to be.

Political pundits and sociologists alike had expressed concerns that since the disappearance of former President Jasmina Halsey, the Federation would almost certainly go through a period of internal strife while the landscape of Federal power adjusted to the new reality.

To everyone's surprise, the situation on the ground has actually stabilised since President Hudson assumed office. It would seem that in the face of tragic loss, personal politics have been put aside, and the overwhelming majority of Federal organisations have chosen to stand united for the good of the Federation.

How long this new coalition will last remains to be seen, but for now at least, Federal residents can rest easy knowing that for this brief moment in time, the Federation stands united for the good of all mankind.


* Getting Serious About Tascheter
Getting Serious About Tascheter \n \nIt's been a little over a week since Felicia Winters assumed control of the Federal Liberal Party, and it looks as if the Shadow President intends to start her time in office by taking on her ex-employer in a bid to stabilize the Federation's interests in the Tascheter sector.

Media agents working on behalf of the Shadow President are currently in the process of spreading information packages throughout the Oduduro system, with the hope being that once residents learn of the Shadow President's new policies they will realise that their best option is to remain part of the Federation.

Unfortunately for Shadow President Winters, representatives of the Sirius Corporation have been extremely busy in the neighbouring system of Akkadia. Sirius has strong business connections with several Akkadian organisations, including Akkadia Inc and Akkadia Crimson Allied Organisation, both of which have been extremely receptive to Sirius's overtures regarding a potential merger.

Both galactic powers have enjoyed success in swaying the population of their respective target systems, but in the end, only one power will be able to establish themselves as the most influential voice in the Tascheter Sector. While relations between the two groups have remained cordial thus far, everything is expected to change as both sides begin to make their final preparations to see who will successfully stake their claim over the region.


* Federation Goes All In
Federation Goes All In \n \nIn late 3300, the small Federal system of Dahan found itself being used as a staging area for a prolonged military campaign against the independent nation of Eranin. Eventually, Eranin managed to force back the Federal invasion. Although not before heavy losses were incurred by both sides.

This week that region once again became a hotbed, though this time of political activity, as both Federal and Alliance campaigners turned out in force in an attempt to exert their influence over the sector.

Mahon supporters flooded the hallways of Dahan Gateway and Whitson Hub, choosing to focus their efforts on systems whose affections for the Federation could be called into question following the events of late last year. President Hudson's supporters went head to head with the Alliance campaigners to support the Federation's position aboard Dahan Gateway. With many an impassioned debate taking place between the two groups along the station's promenade.

Mahon supporters were successful in convincing many of the system's residents that life within the Alliance did indeed sound better than having to send a large slice of their income off to Sol for little apparent return. Although in the end, typical Alliance bureaucracy (in the form of a lack of resources) means that Mahon's supporters will be unable to capitalise on what appeared to be a sure-fire success.

Therefore the real winner of the week's campaigning currently looks set to be Shadow President Winters.

Liberal and Republican Party members have been working around the clock to recruit new supporters in the Federal system of Aulin, with the liberals managing to just about take a lead in what has historically been a republican led state. Contracts are currently being drawn up to allow Shadow President Winters to set up a new command centre aboard Aulin Enterprise, and unless the republican party does something extraordinary to stop it, Friday will see the rise of a new liberal command centre in Aulin.


* Controlling the Credit Crops
Controlling the Credit Crops  \n \nA little over six months ago, the newly discovered naturally occurring plant known as Onionhead was made illegal throughout all of Federal space. Not long after, in an attempt to stop the spread of Onionhead, the Federation launched a violent campaign against the innocent farmers of Kappa Fornacis, led by the vocal Georgio Algeria. Federal marines invaded the farmers' fields, and Federal battle cruisers rained fire from the skies.

The now wealthy farmers managed to create a new strain of Onionhead, and so the spread started, working alone and with others, including the East India Company \u2013 an Imperial trade organisation in which Senator Zemina Torval is a major shareholder.

In an attempt to warn the Imperial Senator away from Kappa Fornacis, President Hudson responded by directing a number of prominent Republican Party supporters to begin permanently establishing themselves in Autahenetsi, to change public opinion as a deterrent to farmers, smugglers and Imperials alike. Although at time of press, neither the East India Company nor Senator Zemina Torval appear to be particularly intimidated by the Federation's efforts.


* Who is Brad Mitchell? The New Federal VP!
Who is Brad Mitchell? The New Federal VP! \n \nAfter the phenomenal political upheaval of the last week and the handover to the new administration, we take a look at our new Vice President Brad Mitchell.

He started as a travelling salesman, a rep for LTT 15449 Dynamic Incorporated, and rapidly climbed the ranks, ending up as President of Sales at Reyan BPS, becoming very wealthy before his move into politics. Brad Mitchell has a good reputation for getting things done, but has made enemies along the way.

Having spent much of his early adult life travelling throughout Federal space on behalf of various interstellar corporations, the new VP is well versed in the needs of the Federal frontier systems, and he is well liked in those systems. It is a clear move by Hudson to show he plans to support the frontier on every level, and has been seen as a very positive move by many living along the Federal borders.


* Only The Strong Survive The Frontier
Only The Strong Survive The Frontier \n \nA week ago the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Camorra of Krisha issued a call asking for allies of the Kumo Crew to aid them in overthrowing the authorities in their homelands. The results were... disappointing for the two criminal families.

Recruitment was slow, with both crews failing to attract more than a few hundred freebooters to their cause. Their failure to recruit new blood proved to be particularly problematic for the Camorra of Krisha, who soon found themselves severely outgunned by the far more influential Krisha Systems Corporation.

By the end of the week, both crews found themselves fighting for their very survival. Finally, after a fierce battle for control of Babbage Station, the Hand Gang managed to establish themselves as a credible threat to the people of Gandii, a fact which inevitably led the New Gandii Democrats to revaluate the wisdom of holding out on Archon Delaine.

As for the Camorra of Krisha, their assault against Fincke Depot ended in total failure. Krisha Systems were able to force the Camorra into a full scale retreat late Thursday evening, so much so that by Friday morning very few members of the Camorra were left to be found in Krisha. Those that remain are being hunted by their former allies, while those that are smart have already slinked off to join more capable crews.


* Winters Sends Envoys to Utopia?
Winters Sends Envoys to Utopia?   \n \nIn a move that many will see as being directly at odds with her predecessor's hard-line stance against the spread of sim addiction in the Federation, emissaries of Shadow President Felicia Winters have been spotted meeting with representatives of Utopia aboard Tanner Settlement in Polevnic.

GalNet reached out to the Shadow President to ask why her support staff were seen visiting the Utopian headquarters, but a spokesman brushed it off as routine.

Political pundits have been quick to point out that visiting Utopia could be seen as a move to support sim fans \u2013 given Utopia's strong connection to the sim gaming industry, though there are other rumours, fuelled by the call for a large order of assorted Metals to be delivered to Antal, has led economists to speculate that the Utopians may be looking to broaden their efforts into other markets.


* The Savage Side of Imperial Slavery
The Savage Side of Imperial Slavery \n \nOn the edges of Imperial space, the line between savagery and civilisation blurs on an almost daily basis. Never has this been more apparent than this weekend, during which hundreds of supposedly honourable Imperial commanders crossed the border to smuggle massive quantities of Imperial Slaves to sell in black markets controlled by the Kumo Crew.

Exactly what the Kumo Crew plans to do with the Imperial Slaves is unknown, although given how much the Kumo Crew were paying for them it's almost certainly not going to be pleasant.

Under Imperial law, citizens are not permitted to sell their Imperial Slaves for service to non-Imperial citizens, nor are they allowed to sell Imperial Slaves on worlds outside of Imperial space. Those found breaking the law run the risk of being forced into service themselves, although in reality Imperial frontier security services tend to turn a blind eye to the practice.

GalNet reached out to the Imperial Slavers Association and received the following statement:

« The sale of Imperial Slaves outside of the borders of Imperial space is strictly prohibited by order of the Senate. Any members of the ISA found engaging in such activity will be removed from the guild and reported to the appropriate authorities. »


* Federal President Hudson Looks to the Future
Federal President Hudson Looks to the Future \n \nIn a speech to business leaders today at the Banqueting Hall in Quenisset on Mars, President Hudson hinted at a raft of new policies to motivate the Federation's youth.

« As I said when I was the Shadow President, we are entering dangerous times. The Empire have been expanding recently more than they have for centuries. We have failed our own frontier worlds for decades and it is hardly surprising they are leaving the Federation as they are. We need a stronger military, a military that gets respect from our youth. We need better soldiers, better fighters, better pilots. We need to be more outward-looking. »

« Our youth has become flabby. Lying inanimate, plugged in to their sims hour after hour, day after day, living in dream worlds that never have existed and never will exist. They need to take part in the real world, and so we will be creating programs to allow them to do just that. Programmes that will excite them, engage them, train them. We will fund these programmes in full, the first of which will be announced to Congress on Tuesday 16th. »

« The Empire needs to know the Federation is strong. We were strong, and now we will be strong again! »

Commentators have already been speculating about the introduction of conscription, but this was denied by Hudson himself « I believe in carrot, not stick ». Congress has already agreed to a substantial rise in military spending, and naval shipyards throughout the Federation are at maximum capacity. Cynics have also noted that the Core Dynamics share price is at an all-time high - Core Dynamics has been a backer of Hudson for a long time, and many say this is his payback.


* Simguru Offers to Share Tomorrow Today
Simguru Offers to Share Tomorrow Today  \n \nSimguru Pranav Antal made an appearance at the original Utopian commune in Antal today, to address rumours that the Utopians had entered negotiations to ally themselves with Shadow President Winters' supporters.

« It is only right for us to honour what came before us. Sol is the birthplace of our race, the shining jewel of our galaxy. At least, it is now that it has been restored to its former glory. »

« In that respect, the Federation is like an elderly relative, full of wisdom and useful life lessons, but ultimately unable to guide its children in finding their truth. »

« In Utopia we respect our elders, but we do not allow their love of the past to obstruct our path to the future. Members of the Federation are free to come to Utopia to study, to shape, to share in everything we have to offer. After all, the abundance of Utopia was created for all of mankind, and we wish for nothing but peace with our other selves. »

« An alliance though? No. »

« While it is our duty to be concerned with the workings of the lower worlds, the Utopians will not allow ourselves to become tangled in the petty politics of those whose only true worry is for their own personal power. »

« Our goods are for sale, but our integrity is not. »

As a reminder to all budding entrepreneurs working hard to scrape some credits from the black, Utopia is currently looking to source a large supply of metals. Traders and miners interested in acting as suppliers to Utopia are being asked to deliver metal to Lobachevsky Station in Antal.


* For Some, President Halsey's Disappearance Is Not \Case Closed\
For Some, President Halsey's Disappearance Is Not \Case Closed\ \n \nWhile the Federation considers President Halsey's disappearance an open and shut case, some groups still doubt the official story. The Knights of the Black, whose members have sworn to defend all human systems against alien aggression, is one such group.

According to the group's founder, « We aren't entirely convinced Halsey's disappearance is the work of an alien species, but we also aren't convinced that it was an accident. Remember that Felicia Winters insisted, even from the beginning, that Starship One was lost due to mechanical failure. Zachary Hudson seemed awfully convinced of sabotage until he became the President. To me, it seems the Federation is covering up something. »

He went on to say, « Such a well-orchestrated strike against any of Humanity's leaders would be a clear sign of an alien threat, which we take very seriously. »

Though the Knights aren't actively searching for Starship One, they claim, « We're keeping our eyes peeled. »


* Chaos in the Kumo Crew
Chaos in the Kumo Crew \n \nLeading a piratical group is tough. The Kumo Crew is growing, but not without a struggle. Archon Delaine has always been a strong leader, and keeps the worst excesses of his lieutenants in check. In truth he leads a disparate group of criminal organisations, and recently infighting and infiltration has been rife within the Kumo Crew since Delaine began accepting new members, causing the Kumo to falter in their bid to take over the Pegasi system.

Rumours coming from Harma suggest that the Pirate King is furious at the chaotic, incompetent and downright treacherous actions being carried out in his name. So much so that Delaine has dispatched the Kumo Crew enforcers to deal with the matter personally. Those who find themselves blocking the Kumo Crew's spread throughout the Pegasi sector will pay the price for their defiance.


* Kappa Fornacis Calls Federal Freedom Into Question
Kappa Fornacis Calls Federal Freedom Into Question \n \nIt has been some time since the Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union has dared to draw attention to itself beyond its home system. However, following a reported trade deal with one of Senator Zemina Torval's corporations, the farmers of Panem look a good deal more confident.

Georgio Algeria, spokesman for the Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union, had this to say on the subject:

« Even with a new President, they won't win. What we have is great, and you can't keep greatness down. That Hudson guy is too uptight. He needs to chill, and I've got just the thing for him! »

« Everything in moderation, my friends. Sims are cool. Hudson's kids don't need to win no prizes for proving who's the best at killin'. They need to chill, to care about each other, get in touch with their roots. »

« The Empire's cool with us. Slavery's not cool, but at least they're doing something about it. These Fed kids signing up to the Navy. Bombing our children. How is that not slavery? Which is better? »


* Angels Flock to Follow the People's Princess
Angels Flock to Follow the People's Princess \n \nFor months, Aisling's Angels have been working hard to support their mistress in her quest to bring about meaningful social change in the Empire. As part of their efforts, millions of slaves have been set free, retrained and rehomed in accordance with Aisling's wishes.

When she lost her bet against Zemina Torval back in April, many within Imperial society thought Aisling's followers would finally realise that she was backing a lost cause and give up. Instead the opposite happened as thousands of Imperial citizens, their hearts touched by the efforts of the people's princess, rallied to her cause. This has turned Aisling into one of the most influential celebrities in the Empire today, to the delight of her powerful backers.

With this new-found support, the people's princess has found herself once again going up against Senator Zemina Torval, as the two powerful senators clash in a bid to gain influence near the Empire's core systems.

Early last week, the two camps worked to rally support amongst senior patrons in Caspatsuria. When it became apparent that the Caspatsuria citizens would only be swayed by their wallets, a wise change in direction by the Angels PR team saw a last-minute burst of activity launch across Grovichun's social media networks. Supporters of both Imperial powers are currently engaged in talks with the respective local authorities in a bid to set up new command centres from which to spread their own particular forms of Imperial life.


* Blaine Address State of the Emperor
Blaine Address State of the Emperor \n \nChancellor Blaine made an appearance before the Senate today in order to provide an update on the Emperor's health, following the attempt on the Emperor's life a little over a month ago.

« I am pleased to report that the Emperor is recovering nicely, » the Chancellor began. « There was some small concern that an excessive amount of toxins had been allowed to take root in the Emperor's body, but His Grace's physicians have proven themselves more than up to the task of removing them. »

« Similarly, praise must go to Princess Lavigny, whose invaluable assistance in tracking down the conspirators led to the restoration of the Emperor's justice in several dozen systems. A fact which I am sure will be of great comfort to those who were worried that the Duval legacy would be allowed to fall into ruin. Doubtless the Princess's father would be extremely proud. »

« On that note, I am pleased to announce that His Grace, Emperor Hengist Duval, has begun to show signs of returning to good health. The Emperor's personal physicians have assured me that should His Grace continue to heal at his current rate, the Emperor will almost certainly make a full recovery. »

« Hail the Emperor, bask in his glory. »


* Prime Minister Mahon Announces Open Trade Agreement in Old World Cluster
Prime Minister Mahon Announces Open Trade Agreement in Old World Cluster \n \nDuring a press conference in Alioth earlier today, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon expressed his gratitude towards the independent pilots who supported his initiative to strengthen the Alliance's economic presence in the Old Worlds cluster. Mahon declared intention to keep the cluster open for traders of all affiliations and has announced an open trade agreement that will grant any trader safe passage.

To ensure the safety of trader ships in the sector, Prime Minister Mahon has commissioned the Alliance Defence Force to establish a permanent presence in the sector, to counter the growing threats to civilian traders from piracy and crime. The deployment of this new Alliance strike force is expected to take place within the next few weeks.


* Federal Vigilantes Defy All Galactic Powers
Federal Vigilantes Defy All Galactic Powers \n \nA long standing Federation leaning vigilante group has announced today that it is declaring itself its own sovereign power, defying all of the great galactic powers in what members of the groups are calling a struggle between \politicians, slavers and warlords.\

The Armada will instead be working to create its own system of governance, based upon its own particular rules of law. The Armada will remain headquartered in the Ngaliba system, where it has resided since 2900 as a Federal detachment of a classified inter-factional combat force. Post Commander Tyllerius Adle pulled his force out of the secretive organization in 3200, re-branding his group as \Adle's Armada » in the process.

In 3301 the Armada still shrouds its self in secrecy and only recruits the finest and cleanest of conscience combative pilots into its ranks.

The group has been known to spring up in times of need to defend the defenceless against forces that seek to to evil in the Galaxy. Adle's Armada will now be acting as its own power in the universe, with members of the group operating primarily in the Ngaliba, Mbukuravi and Kremainn systems.

GalNet reached out to members of Congress for comment, but at time of press had received no reply.


* The Science of a Safer Society
The Science of a Safer Society  \n \nThousands of Pegasi sector civilians were forced to evacuate their homes last week, following a series of brutal raids carried out in the name of Archon Delaine.

Some resilient residents have attempted to reach out to the Federation and Empire homeworlds for assistance, but so far, their pleas for help have gone unanswered. This leaves the question on everyone's lips: who will stop the Kumo Crew?

Local business magnate, Pranav Antal, believes that his Utopians may well be able to provide an answer.

« Their greed, their jealousy\u2026 these are the things that drive the Kumo to try to own, control and destroy everything they see. »

« This desire for base things has led the crew down a dark path, one which has caused much pain for the people of Pegasi. We at Utopia understand their sorrow, their troubles, and we want to help. »

« Agents of Utopia are seeking to open a new commune in Hip 116213. Once approved, our engineers will begin the dangerous process of establishing an enlightened defence against the uncivilised horde. »


* Terror in the Pegasi Sector
Terror in the Pegasi Sector \n \nArchon Delaine and his Kumo Crew have continued their seemingly unstoppable rampage across the Pegasi sector this week, with the Crew managing to establish new strongholds in Arawere, Huaich, LTT 16548 and San Muss.

Reports coming in from the sector indicate that the Kumo Crew are now operating in over 160 different systems, with millions of people being forced to pay the pirates for protection, or else risk death or dismemberment for failing to do so.

Many smaller interstellar corporations have announced that the Pegasi sector is now off limits, a fact which will doubtless lead to more suffering for residents of the region as their economies become affected by the lack of workable trade routes.

Almost 20 billion members of the Federation live within territory that has now been claimed by the Kumo Crew. Despite this, the Federation has yet to take an official stance on the Pirate King's activities.

GalNet reached out to the Federal Navy for comment and was informed that:

« The Navy is aware of the situation in the Pegasi sector. The issue will be resolved in due course, but we are unable to divulge any operational details at this time. »


* GalNet Powers Update Incoming
GalNet Powers Update Incoming \n \nIn the early hours of tomorrow morning GalNet will be releasing the latest statistics and activities of the major powers.

* The Pilots Federation Supports Fuel Rat Initiative
The Pilots Federation Supports Fuel Rat Initiative  \n \nEach year, thousands of pilots go missing in the black.

Some are waylaid by pirates. Others are lost to the dangers of space. However, an estimated 63% of all deep space losses are attributed to pilots who simply run out of fuel in an area where others rarely tread.

Now a new initiative, which is being backed by the Pilots Federation, is hoping to turn those figures around. A group of independent pilots, calling themselves the Fuel Rats, have begun patrolling the outer fringes of civilisation. Their mission? To provide assistance to traders and explorers before their life support runs out.

Commander Murishani of the Fuel Rats issued the following public service announcement regarding what to do in case of a fuel shortage:

1)\tDo not panic. Panicking costs fuel and air. You are running out of both!

2)\tRemain with your ship. Exit supercruise. Throttle to 0. Disable nonessential modules.

3)\tCall for help from the Fuel Rats immediately. Time is precious.

4)\tReduce activity and food consumption. Preserve oxygen. Wait for help.

A full list of active members of the Fuel Rats is available from the Pilots Federation upon request.

* Infection Running Rampant in BD-02 4304
Infection Running Rampant in BD-02 4304 \n \nInfection Running Rampant in BD-02 4304

Hundreds of businesses have closed and thousands of people are quarantined following an outbreak aboard Newton Dock in what could be the most devastating epidemic of the decade.

The illness, the origins of which are currently unknown, has made its way across much of the region. Reports are coming in from surrounding systems indicating that the infection might already be spreading.

Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, released the following statement in regards to the spread of this disease:

« At the risk of causing a panic, it is my duty to report that the outbreak is spreading at an alarming rate. Until we have identified how it managed to reach so many systems in such a short span of time, residents are advised to stay in their homes and travellers are advised to avoid the area. »

« Early signs of infection include vomiting blood, excessive sweating, sores and waves of intense dizziness. If you suspect you've been infected, please report to the local authorities at the earliest available opportunity. They will inform you how to proceed. »

In total almost 27 million residents now find themselves at risk from either disease, famine or both.

* Mahon speaks out on Alliance Values
Mahon speaks out on Alliance Values \n \nPrime Minister Mahon gave a speech today to the assembled graduates of the esteemed Alioth University, the same establishment he graduated from as a student. While his opponents sometimes deride his 'matter of fact' presentation, few could argue against the Prime Minister's passion for the values he holds dear:

« The Alliance of Independent Systems is built upon a single defining principle and that is one of freedom. The freedoms we enjoy range from our personal freedoms as inscribed in the Bill of Human Rights to the freedom of societies and even planets within the Alliance.

« But we should not accept this grace blindly or assume that its existence continues by mere chance. The birth of the Alliance came from removing the burden of the Federation and the Empire who for centuries fought each other for our resources and we were caught helpless in the middle.

« Both of those organisations proudly describe their origins as being freedom from the tyranny of others. And yet now they are the tyranny and it is our duty to oppose them, while also ensuring that we don't become them. »

The speech then turned to the minutiae of the Alliance's democratic process. But pundits were quick to comment that this was a bold statement from the Prime Minister and that perhaps the recent successes in the Old Worlds region show a more robust future for the Alliance in galactic politics.


* Peace and Prosperity through Production
Peace and Prosperity through Production   \n \nThe Utopians unveiled their plans to fight back against the pirates of the Pegasi sector today, at a meeting held aboard Yolen Hub in HIP 116213.

Simguru Pranav Antal was met with wild cheers from the gathered crowds as he spoke about the sector's recent spate of conflicts with the Kumo Crew, the resultant economic downturn and Utopia's plans for turning all of that around.

Outside the station's no-fire zone, followers of the Simguru demonstrated the effectiveness of Utopian technology when a wing of ships equipped with Enforcer Cannons shredded an Anaconda in under a minute. A clear message to anyone who thinks the Utopians will let their communes be pillaged simply because their overall philosophy leans towards peace.

* The Founding of the Federation
The Founding of the Federation \n \nThe Founding of the Federation

In this new series exclusive to GalNet, famed historian Sima Kalhana visits the defining moments of human history since our first brave steps into space and to the star-spanning species we have since become. In this first article, she talks about the founding of the Federation. With a history spanning millennia, it is the oldest of the major factions.

-

In this modern age it's hard for us to imagine that before the Federation, humanity existed on just a single world, bar a few small colonies on Mars and the Moon. Even stranger to our current experience was the fact that so many disparate tribal groupings, or 'countries' existed on one world.

The Federation arose from the ashes of the Third World War in the mid 21st century. The war caused tremendous devastation across the planet, decimating the population.

Many different factors changed humanity's outlook after that. The rise of the corporations, the discovery of the first fossils on Mars, and the explosive exploration triggered by the invention of the hyperdrive by Li Qin Jao and others in the 22nd century, first by unmanned probes, then with manned craft, overtaking the generation ships sent in the previous decades. Despite the huge dangers involved, a massive land-grab followed, fuelled by the voracious corporations.

It wasn't until some of the ecological excesses of these early colonists became apparent over a century later that Earth took its first steps, founding the Federation and  becoming the colossal entity it is now, creating some order in what had become an unruly free-for-all.

 In 2242 the Federation Accord was created outlining certain rights and responsibilities for members, uniting many of the new colonies, by force in some cases. After a short conflict the Taylor Colony in Tau Ceti bacame the first signatory outside the Sol system. The name of the Federation was also changed at this time to the 'Federation of Star Systems', but the name didn't stick and quickly returned to just the Federation.

From that point the Federation provided a stable framework to facilitate the further expansion of humanity to ever more distant star systems but not all colonies wanted a part of this. A distant early colony, formed by a band of political idealists as far from Earth as they could manage, in the system of Achenar would eventually spark another defining moment for the Federation and indeed humanity as a whole.


* Emperor's Grace Blocks People's Princess in Rishair
Emperor's Grace Blocks People's Princess in Rishair \n \nLast week Rishair was the site of political unrest as activists under the banner of \The People's Princess\ Aisling Duval, moved in to disrupt the long standing Imperial slave trade of Rishair. These activists have enjoyed highly celebrated and publicized successful protests in many Imperial systems. However, these fanatical rogue elements operating in support of the People's Princess were given a stark reminder today not to interfere with correct Imperial procedure after mediation attempts by representatives of Admiral Brennus failed.

Rishair is currently the Headquarters for Admiral Brennus, leader of Emperor's Grace and an influential officer in the Imerial Navy. Although Brennus rarely intervenes on purely political matters, he could not stand by and let politics inhibit trade in his vital systems. After failed attempts at resolving the matter diplomatically, Brennus was overheard as saying \I have no patience for this. Contact Senator Patreus, he somehow has the ability to deal with this nonsense!\ according to an anonymous Emperor's Grace staff member.

Immediately thereafter, the Rishair system was prepared to come under the protection of Senator Denton Patreus, in a sign of support to Admiral Brennus and Emperor's Grace through what has become known as Operation BBH by Brennus' advisors. Senator Patreus agreed to step in on Brennus' and Emperor's Grace behalf to establish Rishair and surrounding systems as a military preparation site, legally suspending any rights to protest within the militarized zone.

Although there have been many complaints from the dislodged activists, there has been no comment from Princess Aisling Duval or her staff. Some have commented that this is not surprising given her public relationship with Patreus.

* Aisling Supporters Pledge to Legion
Aisling Supporters Pledge to Legion \n \nIndependent Commanders in support of the People's Princess Aisling Duval have come together in recent weeks under Commander Andariel in the 'Thirteenth Legion'. One Commander reported:

'I was tired of being interdicted every time I tried to run a crate of medicinal supplies in support of the Angels. I sold my cargo bays, fitted shield banks and upgraded my weapon system. Commander Andariel told me where to fight and how.'

At least some Imperial nobility is supporting the pledge of Commander Andariel and others like him. Count Jeffrey Alexander Ryan of Ugain added, 'So many people want to support, few realise how to do it. Some want to trade, others run cargo specifically for my Princess. Some know how to fight, but until the Thirteenth was formed, few knew how to do it making each laser pulse count'.

The Thirteenth Legion has built its base on Chona.


* Open Osmium Contract in Abres
Open Osmium Contract in Abres \n \nThe governing authorities for Pangborn Dock in the Abres star system today released an open contract for a staggering quantity of Osmium.

Osmium is a relatively rare transition metal with outstanding hardness and durability properties. It is often used in specialist alloys for starship construction and other heavy industry. While it is uncommon, analysts claim that there is ample supply in circulation for current civilian and military manufacturing requirements. This has led to speculation that a new player may emerge in ship construction or even that a covert build-up of military ships is being prepared.

Dale Torrance, the Business Development Spokesperson for Pangborn Dock, refused to speculate on the rumours:

« Osmium is a material used throughout industry. As the chosen partner in this venture, we are pleased to announce that there will be significant credit bonuses for the successful completion of this contract. »

He then encouraged miners to investigate the contract for more information.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

The following 10 of the 4479  minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom:

Fong Wang Limited

Ling Deti Blue Dynamic Comms

Values Party of Alano

Canopus Crimson Dragons

Daksakhi Liberals

Gyvatiges Jet Power Industries

Liabeze Legal Organisation

LP 376-62 Collective

New Groombridge 1618 Focus

Zugen Incorporated

When in boom  the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

These 7  minor factions are suffering an economic bust:

HIP 117870 Confederation

Leaders of Kini

Labour of Gali

Devane Patrons of Law

Pachita Crimson Fortune Int

Progressive Party of GD 140

Caeritis Front

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Memorandum of Understanding between citizens of Utopia and Sirius Corp
Memorandum of Understanding between citizens of Utopia and Sirius Corp \n \nIn their convictions that their interests coincide with each other, Commanders following Simguru Pranav Antal and those in the employ of Sirius Gov have agreed a non-aggression pact. They recognise each other's right to exist, and to co-exist in harmony and in peace. Their ships are free to travel within each other's space.

All freelance Commanders wishing to sign the pact are welcomed in Lembava or Polevnic to do so and make sure that part of the galaxy will be more secure in the future.

This agreement has been made to seek the benefit of both their independent territories as a whole, to promote trade between the two powers and ensure the continued existence of civilization devoted to future prosperity rather than past tradition or present comfort.


* Fuel Rat Rescue Operation Saves Millions of Credits
Fuel Rat Rescue Operation Saves Millions of Credits \n \n\I was on my way back from deep space last week when I made a horrible mistake, » stated Commander Fionn Mac Cumhaill. « Running low on fuel, I found a nearby Red Dwarf and expected to fill my tanks but when I exited Frameshift I found myself staring down a T-Tauri with nothing but fumes in my tank. I'd failed to reset my target. That's when I called the Fuel Rats.\

Commanders Beornfri\u00f0, Kerenn and Anuranium responded, locating the drifting Asp Explorer in the PRAEA EUQ SY-S B3-3 system just as its oxygen level dropped to 41 seconds of sustainable life support.

\They saved my Asp and 12 million credits of exploration data\ said Mac Cumhaill. \I owe them my Pilots Federation promotion to 'Pioneer'.\

The Fuel Rat's dispatch service is in operation around the clock. When you're out of fuel don't hesitate. Make the call.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report the latest GalNet data is assembled to present  ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

The following are 10 of the 390 minor factions are in lockdown:

Yupini Imperial Society

Ildaker Prison Colony

LHS 1852 Empire League

HIP 82032 Silver Society

Pirates of Sheela Na Gig

Green Party of LFT 926

Natural Contien Movement

Peckollerci Democrats

Conservatives of Comanga

Crowfor Vision Services

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can reduce the lockdown period.

These are 10 of the 824 minor factions are experiencing civil unrest:

Wong Guin Imperial Society

Freedom Party of LHS 3447

Irukama Mafia

Halbangaay Imperial Society

Ninabin Jet Advanced Inc

Ngarawe Empire Pact

Kalana Independents

Morommo Incorporated

Pirates of Luyten's Star

Synteini Industries

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* United Imperial Offensive into Pegasi Sector
United Imperial Offensive into Pegasi Sector \n \nApathy toward the Kumo Crew's activities on the fringes of Federation space was replaced by the full wrath of Senators Patreus and Lavigny-Duval as the Imperial system of Cuchua came under attack this week.

A high ranking officer of Lavigny's Legion offered the following words as the Legion deployed to assist Patreus' forces in Cuchua:

\We ask all who are loyal to Princess Arissa to join with us in bringing Imperial justice to these barbarians that think us weak like the Federation. »

The call has been heeded by pilots in every major Imperial power.

The expeditionary forces launched a two-pronged attack, spearheaded by the Velites Squadron of Lavigny's Legion, targeting Kumo ships in Cuchua and Harma. The operations, code named « Charybdis » and « Davy Jones, » have led to the downing of hundreds of pirate vessels and dozens of Kumo Commanders. Imperial casualties have been minimal, but the fighting continues.


* Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace Develop Joint Technology Company
Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace Develop Joint Technology Company \n \nIt has been formally announced that an Agreement has been reached between Hammer Arms, biggest independent arms dealer with a seat in Hel, Home of Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace. This is the first ever such agreement made by the fiercely proud and independent Cosmic State with an Imperial faction. Grimnir Allvadderung, CEO of Hammer Arms, kindly invited Admiral Brennus of Emperor's Grace to an evening of carousing and competition. It is reported that vast quantities of mead was consumed by both delegations. This was later followed by an axe throwing contest between Grimnir Allvadderung and Vaarwen Mako Brennus, where Grimnir Allvadderung was declared the winner.

As an esteemed friend and ally, Admiral Brennus was presented with a golden axe by Grimnir Allvadderung in what is believed to be proof of a growing friendship between the two leaders.

On the small matter of the Agreement between Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace no information is being made available at this time other than to declare that Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace agree wholeheartedly in a joint venture regarding research and development of technology and weapons. A joint military exercise of Imperial Naval units and Cosmic State forces in the Hel system was also announced.

* Ambitious Plans for Carns
Ambitious Plans for Carns \n \nThe leadership for Humason Orbital in the Carns system responded today to a report released earlier in the week, suggesting that the mining operations in the system would soon become uneconomical.

Plans were revealed to upgrade the extraction and industrial facilities to support high tech operations. In the press briefing Ramon Lamor, Deputy Communications Officer, commented:

« We should not see the closure of the mines as a problem, but as an opportunity for this system to become a greater player in the economy of the surrounding region. Our researchers have identified a gap in the high technology market that we can exploit. »

He then outlined an extensive programme of acquisitions to provide the robotics needed for the new product lines, which would see both the extraction and industrial concerns replaced. When questioned about the effects of this change on existing businesses, he replied:

« There will obviously be a number of changes with this global shift in focus. However, if we are to thrive in the future then these adjustments must be made. We will provide both financial and logistical support to corporations operating in Carns. »

At the close of the briefing, he stated that the nature of the local workforce would also need to change and that further information would be revealed within the next few days.

* Grand Sale of Slaves in Carns
Grand Sale of Slaves in Carns \n \nFollowing up on yesterday's surprise announcement of changing economic policy in the Carns system, Deputy Communications Officer Ramon Lamor outlined further changes:

« In the fine traditions of the Empire, our extraction facilities relied on the unyielding efforts of our imperial slave workforce. Their devoted service has been the foundation of our historical success. However, in these changing times we need a new skillset to drive the economy. Some of those slaves who possess the correct aptitude or skills are already being prepared for their new roles. For the majority, we are seeking new opportunities for them to continue showing their personal value. »

He went on to explain that the authorities will finance a substantial discount for slaves sold at Humason Orbital. This discount will remain in place until all our imperial slaves have found new places to work.


* Latest Powerplay Column
Latest Powerplay Column \n \nAnother week has passed, and the great and powerful of the galaxy continue to vie for power and influence.  Who has prospered? Who has struggled? Read on to find out.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval continued to expand at a rapid pace despite the fact that having her forces stretched thin and has lost the systems of Nunus and Varka. With little actual enemy activity, it's this over-expansion that spells trouble for the Senator's future plans.

Aisling Duval continues to see huge levels of Commander support, and very little hostile action within her space. She continues to expand her influence at a staggering rate. However, in a first such failure to date, her supporters' attempt to expand into Sounti has been countered by Federal pilots.

Zachary Hudson continues to see extremely heavy enemy activity in the systems under his control, although countered by strong fortification. Hudson has attempted to secure four more systems this week, located within his current territory or in uncontested space.

Felicia Winters again had her pledged supporters successfully secure her sphere of influence in the despite massive incursions by hostile fleets. On the expansion front, Winters' results are more mixed, with Lambla and Carnoeck secured, but attempts to expand towards Imperial space firmly countered.

Zemina Torval continues to see a lot of enemy opposition to her expansion, particularly in the areas bordering Federation space. As a result, three of her expansion attempts have failed. However, Zemina Torval's influence has spread to several other systems, and her borders are well-fortified.

Denton Patreus is no longer in as dire straits as he was two cycles ago, having managed to secure and fortify most of his claimed space. His space continues to see significant hostile action, mainly in border systems. As a result, several of his expansion attempts have failed, although the Senator has managed to secure four new systems.

Edmund Mahon continued to shore up and expand his power base this cycle. While Mahon has seen extremely high levels of hostile activity in the strategically placed Bonitou, outside forces have not managed to compromise the security of his systems or stop his ambitious expansion attempts.

Li Yong-Rui of Sirius Gov is building a power-base in an area of inhabited space just as fine or better than Edmund Mahon's. While Akkadia and 39 Tauri, bordering the Federation, have seen high levels of hostile activity, overall this corporation continues to push its borders with little trouble.

Archon Delaine, the leader of the Kumo Crew has been subject to an Imperial counter-offensive this cycle. While the attempts to undermine his systems have been resisted, the pirate conglomerate's growth has been stopped this week. An aggressive expansion attempt into Cuchua, in Patreus space, and another into Matlehi have both been firmly countered.

Pranav Antal and his Utopia continue to have relatively modest political influence, slowly expanding in face of only minor enemy action and steadily shoring up the organisation's current borders. The exception is the Federation system of Ewah, where focused enemy response stopped the Utopian forces.

* Breakthrough in Artefact Research?
Breakthrough in Artefact Research? \n \nAfter meticulous and sometimes tedious investigation, scientists working under Dr Arcanonn have uncovered that the recently discovered \Unknown Artefacts\ may have some basis in human technology.

Audio studies of the objects show that they emit a distorted but audible signal matching the very long-established Earth signalling scheme morse code, through which the artefact broadcasts the identity of the nearest celestial body when released into free space.

Speculation is rife as to what purpose the artefacts have - scanners, navigational aids,  or Thargoid homing-beacons. All of which is considered more concerning now that it is understood that the artefacts appear to have knowledge of morse code, and thus potentially other human technologies, embedded within them.

Dr Arcanonn's team have renewed their plea to the Federal Government to release any information they possess about the artefacts in order to assist with the continuing research.

\I wish to extend my personal congratulations for your commitment to personal excellence and to the Empire. As you begin your career in the Imperial Navy, I would draw your attention to a cause that has been neglected far too long. Nearly 6 billion Imperial Citizens are currently subject to the lawless Kumo Crew. An elite Imperial vanguard has engaged the forces of Archon Delaine in what we call \Operation Davy Jones.\ I invite all graduates who would uphold Imperial order to join the fleet and liberate the Pegasi sector. We will not abandon our people! We will bring these pirates to justice!\

Cheers echoed through the auditorium as the Senator concluded her remarks. An astounding 73% of the 10,000 graduates joined the Imperial armada bound for the Pegasi sector.

* Leaked Data Causes Concerns over Latest Imperial Technology
Leaked Data Causes Concerns over Latest Imperial Technology \n \nNews of technical documents posted anonymously via the shady <Ahem> dark network are spreading virally and causing widespread concern among Imperial Pilots. According to the documents some of the new Imperial modules that have been appearing recently are linked to research carried out by the discredited Professor Denzile Dex and doubts about their safety have been raised.

Professor Dex has been missing for several years and it is widely believed that his sudden disappearance was connected to the 4EverYoung life-extension technology scandal. Allegations of shortcuts and the withholding of critical data were made following a spate of cases where users of the technology suffered various deforming and debilitating mutations. Dex vanished shortly before he was due to give evidence to the official inquiry investigating the allegations.

According to the latest story, research seized from Professor Dex at the time of the 4EverYoung scandal formed the basis of the design for a number of the latest Imperial prototypes including the Imperial Hammer and the Prismatic Shield Generators. Anecdotal reports of side effects from the new technology have already begun surfacing and a number of concerned groups have called for an official statement from the Senate about the leak.

One report claims that the harmonic adjustments in the design of the Prismatic Shield Generator can cause temporary cognitive impairment and even psychosis. Other reports link a form of high-level radiation emitted by the Imperial Hammer with increased rates of sterility and hormonal imbalances. One angry commentator even claimed it had caused him to develop female physical characteristics.


* The Birth of an Empire
The Birth of an Empire \n \nContinuing GalNet's series about the defining moments in human history, famed historian Sima Kalhana talks about how the Empire came to be.

-

The Empire has become such a dominant presence in human culture that it is easy to forget that for almost a century the heart of what was to become the Empire was just a single system. The Achenar system was first colonised in the middle of the 23rd century. It was founded by an expedition led by Marlin Duval, a wealthy woman who had grown disillusioned by the ever increasing rigidity of the Earth governments and stifling social conformity.

Marlin Duval vowed to get as far from Earth as she could, and after a long and treacherous journey across what was then unexplored space, most of the convoy eventually reached the Achenar system.

The system of Achenar was chosen for the outdoor world orbiting one of its gas giants, already capable of supporting human life, now known as Capitol. There was already life on the planet and though Duval didn't know it at the time, one of the few known sentient species watched their landings.

Back then, life was known to be plentiful throughout the galaxy, though it wasn't appreciated how rare sentient life was. Before long the species was made extinct by the settlers, mainly through imported bateria. Much later, this extinction would later be used as a pretext for Federal intervention in the system.

Under Marlin Duval the population lived under idealistic democratic rule with elected Senators representing the people. This changed dramatically after she died in a speeder crash. Her brother, Henson Duval, then assumed control and established the now familiar line of imperial succession. Some claim that he killed his sister to claim power, but this was never proved.

For many years succession was restricted to the male line, and it was claimed various means were used to restrict royal births to only male children. This practice was later abandoned, and recent events at the heart of the Empire indicate that male succession may soon be broken.

In 2324 Federal forces attempted to invade Achenar, with the pretext  of causing the alien extinction, but also because of Achenar's refusal to join the Federation. It was the conclusion of this war which resulted in the birth of the second of humanity's great power blocs, and cemented Henson's position as a powerful leader of his people.

Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

These 2 minor factions are suffering an economic bust:

Eotienses Silver Universal PLC

Jet Energy Industry

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Reports of the Cerberus Plague beyond BD-02 4304
Reports of the Cerberus Plague beyond BD-02 4304 \n \nThe heroic efforts of the local authorities at Newton Dock in BD-02 4304, combined with independent pilots from far and wide, have slowed the outbreak affecting the local population.

Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, responded to reports of further infections in the nearby systems: Dajoar, Eleu and 20 Ophiuchi.

« We can confirm that there have been isolated incidents which we believe are the same infectious agent that we have seen here on Newton Dock. The populations in those systems should not be alarmed and three operations have been initiated to isolate the sick and prevent further outbreak. »

When asked how the disease had spread to those systems, he replied:

« We can't confirm the vector as yet. Our current belief is that these cases are simply people from here who managed to travel before restrictions were in place. However, as with any outbreak of this magnitude, we are not taking anything for granted. »

He concluded his statement with:

« Once again we are calling on the resources of the independent pilots in the region to help ensure that these cases do not develop into a full-blown outbreak as seen here on Newton Dock. »

While he denied that the team were calling the new disease the Cerberus Plague, one technician did confirm that the name was being used unofficially and came from an unusual three-pronged structure at the 'head' of the phage-like organism.


* Rise of the Nova Fleet on the Frontier
Rise of the Nova Fleet on the Frontier \n \nAfter several decades as a Freelancer member of the Pilots Federation, Commander DarkStar decided to unite a fleet of former Imperial and Federal pilot. Working closely with Commander Equin0x, he united them into forming a freelancer fleet to patrol the frontier and assisting in their economic development. The long term aim is to help free them the superpowers.

CMDR Equin0x commented to GalNet:

\The superpowers exploit the populations of the frontier colonies to gain cheap labour and materials, in conditions that are near to, if not actual slavery.\

Up until now the Nova Fleet constituted a loosely bound alliance of like-minded individuals occupying distant and relatively uncontrolled areas of the frontier. The fleet has recently grown with a sudden influx of new membership, and now this growing collective has now attracted politicians' interest in both Imperial and Federation space.

A spokesperson for the Nova Fleet talked to us about their objectives:

\The Nova Fleet will bring prosperity and security to the frontier of the human civilization. We will avoid political entanglements with the superpowers and their lackeys. The truth of our intentions can be seen from the pilots who once served Federation, Empire and even the Alliance who've joined us! We should not be underestimated. We will bring security to the frontier, even if that means to fight against the Empire, the Feds or bloody aliens!\

Their influence and fame seems to spread fast, and with over 100 ships, their number of associates grows even faster.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report the latest GalNet data is assembled to present  ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

The following are 10 of the 387 minor factions are in lockdown:

Kassimshipa Company

Blue Comms Corp.

Defence Force of Tanmark

Sietae Empire League

Progressive Party of HR 1254

Caria Empire Assembly

Alpha Fornacis Interstellar

Kamocan Purple Universal Corp

Sopontet Fortune Corp.

Velnians Crew

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can reduce the lockdown period.

These are 10 of the 813 minor factions are experiencing civil unrest:

LHS 3749 Group

CT Tucanae Boys

Rata Bares Purple Dragons

Society of Kemwer

Unkuar Jet Natural Group

Lausang Empire Party

Peckollerci Democrats

Natural Contien Movement

Witchhaul Corporation

Sadhen Purple Partnership

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Long Live the Emperor!
Long Live the Emperor!  \n \nSenator Anders Blaine, Chancellor to Emperor Hengist Duval made a surprise statement on the steps of the Imperial Palace today. With obvious joy on his face he declared that the Emperor has awoken from his coma.

« It is with great pleasure I can announce that Emperor Hengist Duval awoke from his coma in the early hours of this morning. His physicians have completed extensive medical tests and declared him well on the way to becoming fit and healthy. They have advised a few days of rest and monitoring before he resumes his state functions.

As can be expected from our Emperor, he has expressed his intention to lead the senate in a few days time. »

The welcome news of the Emperor's recovery has rapidly spread throughout the Empire and inspired impromptu celebrations in every level of Imperial society .

Amidst the well wishes a small number of the more cynical pundits have muttered that they will believe the good news when they see the Emperor in person. Most commentators though are simply overjoyed to hear of the Emperor's return and hope that this will herald a new and more united future for the Empire.

As part of the celebrations for this news it was also announced that all independent pilots with an active rank with the Imperial Navy will be able to purchase the Imperial Courier and Imperial Clipper ships.


* GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots
GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots \n \nThis weekly report indicates some of the minor factions enduring significant health issues such as famine and outbreaks (*).

Outbreaks have been reported by the following minor factions :

Dajoar

Eleu

20 Ophiuchi

Like famines, outbreaks cause a major disruption to the inhabitants' standard of living. Resupply of medicines and related trade contracts are needed to end the outbreak. Due to the state of emergency combat missions and activities provide no effect on influence.

* Origins of the Velites Squadron
Origins of the Velites Squadron \n \nThe ancient proverb, « necessity is the mother of all invention, » remains true, even in 3301.

Commander Na'Qan came from humble beginnings as a miner in distant Imperial colonies. Piracy being rife in those systems, he found himself in their sights regularly. Knowing he could not outrun them in his unshielded Type-6, he learned to elude them. Like Br'er Rabbit's briar patch, the asteroid fields offered him shelter. He learned to manoeuvre silently among the chaotic rocks and metals.

When war broke out in the Pancienses system, Na'Qan joined the fray. He recounted being interdicted by three Fer-de-Lances, and noticed they could not get weapons lock on his craft. Immediately recognizing the relevance of his mining experience, Na'Qan approached his superiors with an idea. Shortly thereafter, Na'Qan began training wings for what would become the Velites Squadron. The stealthy, precision strikes of the Velites are already becoming legend.

For his service to the Empire, Commander Na'Qan is to be awarded the Imperial Order of Merit, First Class, from Senator Arrissa Lavigny-Duval at her headquarters in Kamadhenu this weekend.


* Adle's Armada Looks to End Illegal Arms Deal in Hel
Adle's Armada Looks to End Illegal Arms Deal in Hel \n \nAdle's Armada, a Federally aligned militia group, has responded to reports of an illegal arms deal between the criminal organization Cosmic State, headed by Hammer Arms CEO Grimnir Allvadderung and the Empire aligned Emperor's Grace leader Vaarwen Mako Brennus.

\This cannot stand! Our people of the Labour Party of Caill Reddi cannot bear this tyrant any longer. He takes the food out people's mouths in order to make back room deals with the unscrupulous individuals!\ says Tyllerius Adle III, Grandson of the groups original founder and current Armada CO.

Adle's Armada forces have been laying siege to the League of Hel and have put them into a lockdown state. Citizens formally supporting the arms dealer now question his rule over Jone's Orbital. With the blockade of supplies to League of Hel combat forces, it will only be a short matter of time before the entire system is forced into a civil war between hungry citizens and impoverished arms dealers. Time will tell if Hel will become a sovereign Federally aligned system under the Labour Party of Caill Reddi or if the League of Hel will continue its weapons trade with shady individuals.

\For the safety of the people, this will NOT stand!\


* Security Support Needed For Cerberus Plague Intervention
Security Support Needed For Cerberus Plague Intervention \n \nWith increasing reports concerning the so-called 'Cerberus Plague', officials from Dajoar, Eleu and 20 Ophiuchi have all declared states of emergency. They are calling on bounty hunters and combat-capable pilots in the region help protect the relief efforts.

The issue arises at the same time that some medics in the systems have stated that the vaccines are not proving as effective against these cases, leading to speculation that the organism has mutated. Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock and leading the medical team combating this infection, commented:

« While there are some indications that the organism has changed, we are still analysing the data and it is too early to draw any conclusions. »

Further muddying the waters, a representative for one of the pirate gangs claimed that they were helping the right people. In an anonymous statement, they declared:

« As usual it is the rich and well-connected that benefit from official channels. We are simply making sure that these supplies reach the people who need them the most. »


* Grand Slave Sale in Carns Ends
Grand Slave Sale in Carns Ends  \n \nThe grand slave sale held on Humason Orbital in the Carns system has ended. Deputy Communications Officer Ramon Lamor declared the sale a success, but refused to comment further, or provide actual numbers. He did confirm that a report analysing the sale and the recent activity for the planned market changes at the station would be presented next week.

There have been reports of unrest on the station since the announcement that as of next week, the local economy would be transformed to deal with High Tech goods and services. There was no official comment on these reports at this time.

* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nIt's time for another weekly report on the struggles of the foremost political powers in the galaxy. With ongoing hostilities throughout inhabited space, who has benefitted from the chaos, and who has lost favour?

 Arissa Lavigny-Duval has consolidated her existing power base this week and prepared for future expansion. Faced with no new systems to claim for Lavigny-Duval, her supporters directed her efforts to massively fortifying her systems and partaking in the Imperial offensive against Archon Delaine, set to continue for the foreseeable future.

Aisling Duval still expands her power-base at a rapid and consistent pace, claiming several new systems and the support of another Commander group, The 13th Legion. As quick as Aisling's rise to power has been, her efforts to expand towards Federation space have been blunted once more, when Winters' pilots halted her attempt to claim Ax Yac Baru.

Zachary Hudson managed to expand his influence into two new systems this week, despite seeing continued, massive challenges to his power through his controlled space. With a focus on fortifying his existing systems and relatively little attention given to expansion, Hudson might have issues claiming new systems in the coming weeks.

Felicia Winters continues to have supporters secure her space, with focused fortification stopping all attempts to seriously undermine her control of her systems.  Her expansion continues to see mixed success, with several systems claimed but others successful opposed - most notably the attempt to claim Lugh.

Zemina Torval has seen a substantial drop in support this week, likely due to significant commercial concerns withdrawing financial support for the Senator's operations. Fortunately for Torval, this calamity coincided with a significant drop in enemy activity against her systems, allowing her to successfully fortify and expand despite her reduced following.

Denton Patreus is the big beneficiary of the combined Imperial offensive into the Pegasi sector. While he only enjoys modest levels of Commander support, he is able to continue to shore up and expand his sphere and influence, now that the Kumo Crew no longer puts pressure on his space.

Edmund Mahon rapidly expands his powerbase, claiming an amazing ten more systems this week. This quick growth brings Mahon's sphere of influence closer to that of several other groups, potentially exposing him to increased enemy activity in the future weeks, and spreading out his forces.

Li Yong-Rui of Sirius Gov continues to see his corporate government expand its influence at a very quick rate, pushing further towards both Federation space, and the territory of Archon Delaine, Pranav Antal and Edmund Mahon. While generally Sirius Gov sees little opposition to their expansion attempts, their attempt to claim Chounjemait this week has been stopped, presumably by Mahon's pilots.

Archon Delaine has seen his Kumo Crew weather the Imperial offensive with surprising fortitude. Despite massive enemy incursions, the pirate lord has claimed three more systems this week, albeit none of them Imperial. Due to Imperial attacks being focused on their border systems, the Kumo Crew was able to focus their fortification in a few areas and weather the storm, at least for now.

Pranav Antal continues to see the benefits of diplomacy and the Utopia's safe strategic position, seeing little in way of hostile activity. While only a small number of Commanders support the Utopian project, they were able to claim another system for the Simguru and to fortify their key systems against enemy incursions.

* The Emperor Speaks out for Unity
The Emperor Speaks out for Unity \n \nAlthough the Emperor showed some signs of frailty when he appeared before the Senate earlier today, his voice was firm as he called upon the assembled senators to work together and not against each other for the good of the Empire.

« We live in times that hold great promise for our beloved Empire. The uncertainty of the past months has weakened our resolve and this cannot be allowed to continue. For too long some leaders of our society have vied against each other and squandered resources over a matter which will be guided by tradition.

« As Emperor it is my duty to ensure the success of the Empire and its continuation long into the future. To that end the previously announced marriage with my good friend Florence Lavigny will proceed at the earliest opportunity. As the wedding has already been announced we will not have to wait the customary thirty days to conduct the ceremony, but we will still give time for wellwishers to attend. Preparations are in the process of being finalised and will be announced by the middle of next week. »

His speech continued for thirty minutes and covered a range of topics including praising his long term friend  Chancellor Anders Blaine for his stalwart support. The Emperor left the senate to a standing ovation and cheers from the normally businesslike senators.


* GalNet Weekly Expansion List
GalNet Weekly Expansion List \n \nEach week GalNat presents a short list of 10 of the 1745 minor factions currently expanding into new systems (*).

* A Clash of Titans
A Clash of Titans \n \nIn this third article in GalNet's series about the defining moments in human history, famed historian Sima Kalhana discusses the first war between the Federation and what would become the Empire.

-

Although there had been other small-scale incidents beyond the Solar System, the war between the Federation and Achenar (as it was then) was notable as the first large-scale interstellar conflict. Much has been made over the years of the Federation's reasons for invading Achenar, in particular the claim that the annihilation of the native sentient species was little more than a slim pretext. While it was certainly true that the principal reason for the military action was Achenar's refusal to join the Federation, it is also worth noting that the protection of xeno-culture and life forms was a key tenet of the Federation's founding.

Under the command of Admiral Richard Morgan, a fleet was assembled at Beta Hydri and began its transit to Achenar towards the end of 2323. That region of space was relatively unexplored and thinly populated at the time, meaning that the fleet lacked the logistical support needed for a mission of this scale.

Despite a long and fragile supply line, Morgan chose to engage the defenders in a single large battle. Achenar was alerted to the plan and laid an ambush for the invaders, applying the infamous pack-hunting formation against the Federal fleet initially, then against its supply lines.

Throughout 2324 the Federal fleet continued to try and establish a foothold in the system, but with little success. The constant attrition took its toll on the invaders and in 2325 Achenar counterattacked in what is now remembered as the 'Great Battle of Liberation'. Every local ship, civilian and military, was pressed into service in a coordinated attack against every element of the invasion fleet.

The battle succeeded in pushing the Federal fleet out of Achenar and they retreated to their base in Beta Hydri. Bolstered by improved supply, the Federal fleet held its ground. Skirmishing between the two navies continued for another fifty years. During this time, and seeing the need for a buffer zone around their home system, Henson Duval expanded into the nearby systems. This heralded the change from a single-system colony to a pan-system empire, and so the Empire as we know it today was born.


* The Unfettering of the Pegasi Sector
The Unfettering of the Pegasi Sector \n \nThe Kumo Crew has been known to brand free citizens as slaves and ferry them to an uncertain fate in their capital system, Harma. The Imperial blockade of Harma and the surrounding systems has intercepted thousands of these slaves, many of whom are emaciated, deeply bruised, and otherwise afflicted.

One fresh graduate of the Imperial Naval Academy had this to say regarding his observations:

\10 years ago my family had a slave. It wasn't until he paid his debts and returned to his family that I learned he was not my brother. My father told me on that day to remember Peter, my « older brother, » because I too may become indebted, or sponsor a slave like my \brother.\ That is Imperial Slavery. This... this slavery must be destroyed.\

Philanthropic representatives of Sirius Corp. have extended humanitarian services by returning the slaves, liberated by the Imperial fleet, to their homes and families.


* Governor Joel Xander Removed from Office and Arrested
Governor Joel Xander Removed from Office and Arrested \n \nJoel Xander, the Federal governor of BD-22 3573 of the Federally aligned Forrester Station, has been removed from office and arrested by Federal agents in a surprise raid early this morning. Xander and members of his family have been taken off the planet in an escorted Dropship marked with the insignia of the Federal Intelligence Agency.

While there is no official statement about the allegations against Xander at this time, recent events in BD-22 3573 give reason for speculations about the background of this dramatic arrest. It has been suspected for a long time that Xander's friendly relations with local rulers like King Justice II of the Justice Party and Supreme Leader Anxo Lino of BD-22 3573 Flag might some day cause trouble.

* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

The following 10 of the 4370 minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom:

Mombawet Nationalists

Amementi Silver Life Exchange

Allowair Constitution Party

NLTT 21088 Bridge Network

Independents of LFT 37

HIP 15205 Prison Colony

Finteno Free

Workers of Luan Yun Di Green Party

Waq Services

Uzumeru Netcoms Incorporated

When in boom the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

These 2 minor factions are suffering an economic bust:

Wolf 750 Liberals

Jet Energy Industry

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Fuel Rat Deep Space Relay Rescue
Fuel Rat Deep Space Relay Rescue \n \nThe Fuel Rats received a distress call from Cmdr Neospike as he returned from Sagittarius A* when a broken fuel scoop left him stranded over 3,600 light years from civilization. The Reboot/Repair sequence failed to fix the fuel scoop.

Several commanders responded to the distress call, including Domaq, Paul_Kavinsky, Rusticolus, Cpt_Shinobi, Surly_badger, and Anuranium.

Cmdr. Domaq quickly arrived on scene and provided an initial refuelling to ensure the ship could remain powered while the other ships moved into position.

A relay operation involving several ships and roughly 540 limpet drones then proceeded. Speed was a priority due to the damage Cmdr. Neospike's ship had undergone leaving all of his systems at less than 5%.

As of this reporting the Fuel Rat initiative has rescued over 190 stranded pilots.


* Prism Senator Missing
Prism Senator Missing \n \nIn the early hours of this morning, a security alert was received from the Imperial suite where Senator Kahina Tijani Loren has been residing.

The entry to the residence was found to be locked, and no response was received from inside. Security personnel were authorised to break in.

The interior of the suite was found to be pristine, with no evidence of habitation. In-room holofac consoles were found not to have been used throughout the duration of the Senator's apparent occupation. A search has revealed no sign of the Senator's whereabouts.

Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney made a brief statement to the press. « Senator Kahina has previously empowered me to represent the Prism system on her behalf. I will do my best to discharge that duty according to her instructions. Senator Kahina is a very private individual, and has not sought my, or any other, counsel in the last month. We do not know where she has gone. Naturally we are concerned about her safety and would urge anyone who knows of her whereabouts to contact the authorities immediately. Her disappearance is very disturbing indeed. »

Reaction across the Empire was muted, but many have speculated that something underhand has happened to the visiting Senator.

« Doesn't matter what Delaney says, » said a commentator from the Imperial Citizen. « Prism belongs to Patreus now, Kahina's just abandoned it and all the citizens she professed to care about. She's a coward and an irrelevance. »

« Did she get too close to the fires burning in the Empire? » asked Kazien Vantris, chief editor of the Imperial Herald. « Or is she pursuing some other objective? She was always determined and bold. Wherever you've gone, Lady Kahina, farewell. »

Lady Kahina's Imperial Courier, the 'Seven Veils', still at the Capitol spaceport, was impounded and examined. It was found to be completely stripped of all valuable equipment, with the modifications made at Avalon shipyards discovered to be carefully crafted fakes.

Lady Kahina's Imperial tiara was found in the cockpit, along with a small medallion bearing an ancient symbol on one side and the word 'Salom\u00e9' on the other.

The symbol is believed to belong to an organisation some refer to as 'The Dark Wheel'.

Cerberus Plague Outbreaks in the Bast, Una and Santjalan Systems \n \nReports that the Cerberus Plague has reached Hart Station in the Bast system, Hoard Orbital in the Una system and Cantor Terminal in the Santjalan system is causing fear amongst the population. So far a cure hasn't been found for this disease despite the continuing work of Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, and medical teams in the surrounding systems. In a statement he reiterated that people should remain at home.

Hospitals and care facilities in these systems are already overloaded as the number of infected people rapidly rises. Volunteers and local security personnel are aiding the health services in managing the crisis as well as trying to maintain the rule of law.

Any pilots in the region are being called upon to help deliver medical aid to the affected starports.

* Victoria Wolf VI and Commodore Stone launch Operation Augeas
Victoria Wolf VI and Commodore Stone launch Operation Augeas \n \nIn a joint press conference, Victoria Wolf VI, First Merchantress of Wolf 406 Transport Co, and Commodore Helena Stone of the Alliance Defence Force have announced the launch of Operation Augeas. This is a campaign to rid BD-22 3573 of criminal elements troubling local miners and traders. The Federation has acted swiftly after receiving the results of the investigations led by Commodore Stone. The local absolutistic factions, however, need to be dealt with more bluntly.

Wolf and Stone, who besides their main responsibilities also have seats on the board of the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, explained that they have secured the funds to pay out a bonus for all bounties cashed in Planck Orbital.

Stone was eager to point out that this is not a military operation. The ADF will observe the situation and only intervene in case of escalation as « the system does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Alliance ».


* Meet the Powers \u2013 Aisling Duval
Meet the Powers \u2013 Aisling Duval \n \nIn this new series, exclusive to GalNet, the popular political commentator Marcus Macmillan looks at some of the movers and shakers in 3301. In this first article he examines the life of the popular darling of Imperial politics: Princess Aisling Duval.

Aisling Duval is Prince Harold's eldest child, but has gained a substantial following on her merits. She appears to be a canny operator, although many would argue that her advisors provide her with a veneer of acumen. She is young at only 25, and very visible in the media. Her claim to the throne is technically nullified by the fact that her parents were not married, but her claim is no weaker than some of the other contenders.

The people's princess (as she is sometimes known) is extremely popular with many citizens, clients and patrons. She regularly appears on lightweight chat shows, but tends to avoid anything where she might have to face tough questions.

At heart Aisling is a populist, taking many of her views from the public mood. She splits her time between managing her brand from Cemiess, and spending time with her father in Achenar. Her mother died of a drugs overdose when she was young which, combined with her father's unfortunate legacy from a hedonistic life, has left Aisling with a passion for helping those whose lives have taken a turn for the worse.

Despite her youth, she enjoys considerable support from the people and also from elements who would benefit from shaking up Imperial society.


* The Sirius Corporation \u2013 The First of the Mega-corporations
The Sirius Corporation \u2013 The First of the Mega-corporations \n \nIn this latest edition of GalNet's series relating key points in human history, popular historian Sima Kalhana addresses the rise of the first mega-corporation.

Apart from a few isolated backwater systems, the presence of mega-corporations is ubiquitous throughout civilised space. Massive as many of these organisations are, none of them compare to the wealth and influence of the Sirius Corporation.

The rise of the largest corporation in history started in 2339 when the Sirius Corporation launched the first completely corporate colonial mission arrived in the Sirius star system. The continual state of conflict between the Federation and the Empire catapulted the Sirius Corporation into an economic powerhouse as they became the lead supplier of fuel, then later drives and other technologies.

Within a century, its products were integrated into military and civilian production. It also developed an envied trusted status with both superpowers and indeed supplied both sides during their conflicts. This in part was due to strict information restriction protocols and an open promise that it would favour neither side during any conflict.

The Sirius Corporation developed its own code of strict laws to ensure fair dealing as well as the good governance of its workforce. Its influence reached such a state that the so-called 'Sirius Convention' was applied not just during deals with the corporation, but between independent systems as well.

Throughout the years, fuel and drive production has remained their core business, although judicious expansion into other markets has driven its astronomical growth. The Sirius Corporation now operates several product-oriented divisions including: Sirius Catering, Sirius Mining, Sirius Power, Sirius Luxury Transports, Sirius Industrial and Sirius Atmospherics. Most recently they launched a new venture, Sirius Gov, to provide governmental services for population management on all scales.

Its history has been marked with some failures, most notable of which is the Antares incident which I will examine in the next article. However, its successes have far exceeded those failures and the Sirius Corporation remains the most powerful corporation in known space.


* The Code Leaves Archon Delaine's Crew
The Code Leaves Archon Delaine's Crew \n \nSome months ago, Archon approaches Captain Anopheles of The Code and says: 'Ano, you're my kind of guy. Your crew has been making waves as the most successful of all the pirate crews. Come over to me and make an alliance. I have my tech guys making some sweeeeeeeet tech and I'm running my own space. You can be one of my trusted lieutenants if you bring your guys over.\

That sounded good, so Anopheles took his boys over to Harma. Discontent started almost immediately when they learnt that running a couple of systems was less about scantily clad slave girls serving you rum and more about being a bureaucrat.

When the new weapon was revealed, that was the last straw for The Code as it wasn't what they'd expected.

Captain Anopheles met with Archon and they have a frank and lively debate with added knives. The Code gave him two weeks for things to get better. Arechon refused to change for them, so The Code left.

The Code are going back to basics and going to be roaming the space lanes as \independent asset redistributors\. In short, they have left the desk behind and have picked up their grappling hooks again.


* Carns Economic Success
Carns Economic Success \n \nNewly promoted Chief Communications Officer Ramon Lamor held an enthusiastic press conference announcing the success of Humason Orbital's project to upgrade its economy to High Tech.

« This is great news for our future. This economic development will lead to a new era of prosperity for Humason Orbital and the Carns system as a whole. »

When asked about the civic disruption reported in previous weeks, he replied:

« There have been a few and thankfully isolated disruptive elements seeking to keep our fine society in an ever-declining economic state. These individuals have been encouraged to see the error of their ways and are now completely onboard with our grand economic plan. »


* Operation Davy Jones - Frontline report
Operation Davy Jones - Frontline report \n \nIt has been over two weeks since the Kumo Crew's attempted expansion into the Imperial system of Cuchua was answered with 'Operation Davy Jones'. With Imperial Commanders combining their efforts to contain and eventually wipe out the pirate organisation, the Pegasi Sector has been under siege. With an end to the conflict nowhere in sight, we asked Commanders on both sides for their views on the offensive and their forces' efforts.

Commander Stateira \Starcloak\ Eleshenar, aligned with Senator Patreus, said: \It has been a slow start in the Pegasi Sector, but the offensive is just gearing up. Our ultimate aim is not only to free Imperial citizens from unlawful bondage, but to liberate all persons held in branded slavery by the Kumo Crew.\

Her sentiment was echoed by Commander Corrigendum of Lavigny's Legion: \Since the first wave of Operation Davy Jones, Archon's forces have been routed from Imperial space. Some milestones were not met as anticipated, but we anticipate greater results as the full might of the Imperial fleet is brought to bear.\

In keeping with those statements, the Imperial offensive shows no signs of relenting, with heavy clashes in the systems of Anedjete, Sopontet and Huichi, amongst others . While the Kumo Crew continues to rule some 5.6 billion Imperial citizens, attempts to conquer more Imperial systems have been countered. However, the pirates' stern resistance to Imperial undermining of their territory has given many of their pilots a boost of confidence.

In a brief interview, Commander GluttonyFang, one of the pirates coordinating the Kumo Crew's efforts against the Empire, said: \What we lack in number we make up with our indomitable spirit to fight against imperial oppression. The Kumo Crew will not relinquish its grip on the galaxy. Even if our mortal vessels fail us, we'll haunt our enemies with the wrath of our spirit.\

Commanders on both sides appear to agree on one thing: that the fate of the Pegasi Sector will be decided in battle. In response to a question about the possibility of a diplomatic settlement, Commander Corrigendum said: \The Empire refuses to negotiate with any who hold its people captive. Our people will be set at liberty or their captors will face annihilation.\ With Archon Delaine continuing to defy Imperial demands, it would seem peace is a distant prospect for the once-quiet Pegasi Sector.

* GalNet Weekly Expansion List
GalNet Weekly Expansion List \n \nEach week GalNat presents a short list of 10 of the 1,745 minor factions currently expanding into new systems (*).

Union of Calili Free

LHS 1122 United Limited

Jet United Co

Eotienses Citizens' Forum

Kumal Partners

Quaaybuwala Empire League

Wurun Legal Commodities

HERZ 13422 Systems

Partnership of Kalangputys

Revolutionary Zlotrimi Green Party

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

* Emperor's Grace and Cosmic State Commence Weapons Manufacture
Emperor's Grace and Cosmic State Commence Weapons Manufacture \n \nFollowing the very recent expansion by Emperor's Grace into an Imperial system, a suitable industrial location for the production of advanced technology and weapons has been identified. It is deep within Imperial space and protected by forces loyal to Emperor's Grace. The unnamed system presently has production facilities for both Battle Weapons and Personal Weapons.

Grimnir Allvadderung, CEO of Cosmic State's Hammer Arms and Vaarwen Mako Brennus, Leader of Emperor's Grace met in Rishair to inform the media about the exciting developments between Cosmic State and Emperor's Grace. This announcement was immediately overshadowed by the galaxy wide public announcement that the wedding of Emperor Hengist Duval to Florence Lavigny was to proceed as soon as possible.

This historic Royal announcement preceded yet another evening of carousing by the two friends, and large quantities of beer were consumed. The brewer responsible for the consignment of Beer delivered to the celebrations sadly died that evening, having fallen into a vat of malt, allegedly not long after a number of guests complained about the consistency of the beer. An agricultural system is therefore being considered as a potential location to produce mead in Emperor's Grace territory and additional beehives are to be located on the planet's surface.


* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nIt's time for another weekly report on the struggles of the foremost political powers in the galaxy. With ongoing hostilities throughout inhabited space, who has benefitted from the chaos, and who has lost favour?

Arissa Lavigny-Duval has mustered enough resources to continue expansion despite her focus on the Imperial offensive against the Kumo Crew. Arissa claimed HIP 32812 and Phracani almost entirely unopposed. At the same time, hostile wings have continued to undermine her territory, and while their efforts were largely contained, this disruption helped to push Lavigny-Duval into turmoil.

Aisling Duval claims the #1 spot in galactic rankings this week, after another round of rapid expansion. While Aisling's supporters succeeded in securing her systems against enemy incursions, the effort to claim HIP 95256 was stopped in a surprise opposition push that is variously blamed on either Mahon's pilots or other Imperials.

Zachary Hudson has for several weeks experienced severe efforts to undermine his control, but his supporters have consistently succeeded in fortification. However, while Hudson claimed two new systems, this week the President's enemies successfully undermined Hanggardi, pushing the administration into turmoil.

Felicia Winters saw her efforts to claim HDS 1065 and Potamoi fail, as Federal space continues to see heavy, regular infiltration by hostile Commanders. At the same time, the Shadow President managed to expand her influence to three new systems, and to counter undermining efforts by the means of well-coordinated fortification.

Zemina Torval saw another drop in support this week, reflected in the successful enemy undermining of Tanghpon and the failure of her expansion attempts into HIP 23824 and Mandhrithar. At the same time, remaining Torval associates made good use of their now-limited resources, securing Jamariges and shoring up vulnerable border systems.

Denton Patreus has had his supporters focus their efforts on just one system this week, expanding into Vaka and abandoning attempts elsewhere. This is likely due to many combat pilots pledged to the Senator focusing on the offensive against the Kumo Crew, which continues to take the pressure off Patreus' once-threatened systems.

Edmund Mahon expanded quickly this past week, just as he has for the last month. This allowed him to greatly expand his influence and climb the galactic rankings, but it presents the Alliance politician with a new problem. With Mahon's territory so spread out, fortification efforts are becoming increasingly difficult, and several systems have fallen into chaos following heavy undermining.

Li Yong-Rui has seen a growth both in territory and enemy action similar to Edmund Mahon's and with similar results. A combination of rapid expansion and increased undermining by hostile wings has thrown some of the Sirius Gov's systems into a state of turmoil. While the situation is not as severe as for Mahon, thanks to extensive fortification, Li Yong-Rui's troubles as a symptom of the same issues, an increasingly large territory policed by a stretched security force.

Archon Delaine put up a stern defence against the combined Imperial offensive into the Pegasi Sector for the past two weeks, but the first cracks have shown in the pirate crew's fortifications. Half a dozen of Archon's systems, including He Xians and San Muss, have been successfully undermined by Empire-aligned wings. While the pirate crew remains resolute in the face of the massive assault, securing two more systems this week, the pressure seems to only be increasing.

Pranav Antal successfully expanded into HIP 116213 after several failed attempts in the past. Speaking about the system a month ago, the Simguru called the planned new commune \an enlightened defence against the uncivilised horde\. This provocative expansion was possible by the peace Utopia continues to see, with their space considered to be, in the recent weeks, one of the safest places in the galaxy, thanks to the relatively small organisation's non-threatening attitude towards its neighbours.

* Dignitaries Start Arriving on Capitol
Dignitaries Start Arriving on Capitol \n \nIn scenes reminiscent of January, dignitaries and guests from the farthest reaches of the Empire have started arriving on Capitol. Already there is a shortage of suitable accommodation for the guests, and various senators are taking advantage of this by providing places to stay for favoured visitors.

While there is a festival atmosphere to the city, many are taking advantage of the influx of influential people to work deals and to make plans for the future. Since the Emperor's recovery, there has been a marked improvement in the mood of the citizenry as they see this as an end to the uncertainty over the past several months. Security is as tight as ever, and the secure area around the Imperial Palace has been given the nickname 'the fragrant city', because of the proliferation of flowers and finery along and around those already opulent boulevards, gardens and buildings.

In a move well received by the populace, Chancellor Anders Blaine has declared that the wedding day will be a public holiday so that all may celebrate along with the Emperor and his family.


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report
GalNet Weekly Conflict Report \n \nThis weekly transmission takes the latest GalNet data and lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy. (*).

These are 10 of the 12,542 minor factions involved in a civil war:

Uadjarii Nobles

Wogama Gold Council

Hou Yangk Partnership

Nu Tauri Mob

Traditional LHS 135 Flag

Labour of LHS 135

Nurundere Power Limited

Natural Nurundere First

Kholevi Labour

New Kholevi Constitution Party

Civil wars take place between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets like starports. During civil wars only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

The following are 10 of the 2,485 minor factions at war:

Sitakapa Empire League

LPM 746 Life Commodities

Jet Power Exchange

Fugeirones Shared

Jang Tun Corp.

Raiders of Theemetana

Pirates of LHS 450

Independent Savaroju Values Party

Auaker Prison Colony

Deciani Empire League

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict standard of living, wealth and security are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges then the war will end in a ceasefire.

* Plague Fighters
Plague Fighters \n \nIn response to the devastating Cerberus Plague outbreak on the frontier, the Dukes of Mikunn have mobilized their members, the Mercenaries of Mikunn, to affected systems in an attempt to assist local governments in quelling the plagues.

Having faced a plague similar to that affecting current star systems for weeks, the massive amount of stockpiled medicine will now be moved to affected systems along with medical scientists in hopes of finding the source of the plague. Fighter wings have also been scrambled to provide safe passage for pilots carrying medicine and to enforce quarantine on local citizens.

When asked about the extreme measures they are employing the younger brother of the Dukes, Caius, stated:

\When we had to deal with the infamous plague of HR 7327 our thoughts went to the people first and foremost, but by not locking down the system and enforcing quarantine the plague had spread to all nearby systems. For weeks we dealt with the same plague in Mikunn, Sukua and Sefry's on top of HR 7327. It was then that we realized that enforcing quarantine would benefit the people more than not enforcing one. The current spread of the epidemic is due to the failure of the powers to act in the best interest of their own people.\

Mercenary wings are expected to arrive later today and will remain within the affected systems until the outbreak has been dealt with.

* Federation Secession Crisis
Federation Secession Crisis \n \nDebate continues to rage in local governments throughout the Pegasi sector over Senator Lavigny-Duval's invitation to become Imperial citizens. The debate has reached a fevered pitch in some systems.

\Our petitions for assistance from the Federation have fallen on deaf ears for months now. I'm tired of the demonizing epithets cast at « Imperial slavers » while Federation citizens are being forcibly carried away into slavery by the Kumo Crew. Hudson and Winters are nothing but spineless cowards and hypocrites, » spat the enraged governor of the Wudjal system. « The Wudjal system is home to more Federation citizens than the entire Imperial population occupied by the Kumo Crew. Until the Federation honours its commitments to us, we will not send a single credit to Sol. I recommend that every governor in the Pegasi sector open an Imperial embassy. At least Imperial citizenship means something.\

* Meet the Powers \u2013 Arissa Lavigny-Duval
Meet the Powers \u2013 Arissa Lavigny-Duval \n \nContinuing this GalNet exclusive series, political commentator Marcus Macmillan writes his opinion of some of the movers and shakers in 3301. In this second article he looks at one of the most respected women in Imperial politics: Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval .

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's success as a senator often eclipses the fact that as the daughter of the late Prince Aristide de Lavigny, she is also a princess by birth. It says much of her character that she prefers to represent herself with her achievements rather than just her bloodline. In Imperial politics, of course, having the right bloodline is also an asset and she is astute enough to make use of it when she needs to.

In popularity she rivals Princess Aisling Duval, partly because she is happy to tackle hard issues head on. Her primary platform is one of honour and she devotes much of her attention to tackling corruption. She is a familiar face in the Imperial court and her views often reflect those of the Emperor. The planned wedding between Emperor Hengist Duval and her mother, Florence Lavigny, will secure her position as next in line if anything should befall the Emperor.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

The following 10 of the 4204 minor factions are currently enjoying an economic boom:

Family of Euryale

Hajo Order

Ditibi Services

Witou Empire League

Meinjhalara Transport Services

Alliance of Cileni

Miquitagat Empire Assembly

Social LTT 7453 Free

Revolutionary Party of Lu Wang

Independents of Kappa Fornacis

When in boom the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

These minor factions are suffering an economic bust:

NLTT 12619 Confederacy

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Is Arissa Lavigny-Duval Next in Line?
Is Arissa Lavigny-Duval Next in Line? \n \nWith the wedding of her mother and the Emperor due to take in place in just over a week's time, it now looks certain that Arissa Lavigny-Duval will become heir apparent to the throne. When asked about this during the Imperial Herald political special show about the upcoming wedding, she said:

« Like all Imperial citizens I am overjoyed at the Emperor's  recovery from his coma. As a close member of the family, I was of course kept in the loop concerning his condition and we all expected that he would make a full recovery. »

In a breach of etiquette for what was supposed to be a light-hearted programme, the reporter pressed for a more direct answer. With regal dignity Arissa Lavigny-Duval replied:

« We are only days from the Emperor returning to the public stage. Trying to debate about what might occur if he were to die in these intervening days is both rude and disrespectful of our Emperor. I look forward to many years in service of Emperor Hengist Duval in whatever capacity he deems appropriate. »

The live online audience booed the commentator and applauded her response.


* Meet the Powers \u2013 Edmund Mahon
Meet the Powers \u2013 Edmund Mahon \n \nContinuing this GalNet exclusive series, political commentator Marcus Macmillan writes about some of the movers and shakers in 3301. In this third article he looks at Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon.

Politicians from the Federation and Empire often underestimate their counterparts in the Alliance. This is in part due to their relative sizes, since of the three superpowers the Alliance is by far the smallest and least powerful. However, it should be remembered that the Alliance was born from defeating both the Federation and the Empire on Alioth, a topic I'm certain the esteemed Sima Kalhana will cover in her Sunday posting sometime soon. The other superpowers also see the Alliance's complex interlocking of systems, committees and power-sharing as a limit on the Prime Minister's influence.

Edmund Mahon is a career politician and knows the Alliance political system well. He has a strong academic background as well as a lifetime of service. While some of his counterparts lacked leadership or the ability to drive the disparate elements of the Alliance, he is known to be able to work within the system and actually get things done.

Some would argue, and I count myself among them, that Mahon is probably the greatest leader the Alliance has seen since its inception. He isn't much to look at, but his drab exterior belies a cunning mind and a will for the Alliance to bring its values to more systems. He is also an expert at ensuring that the concerns of individual systems are properly represented within the Alliance, something that is seen as very attractive for new member systems.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

The following are 10 of the 355 minor factions are in lockdown:

Haroingori Co

Korovii Free

United Carnoeck for Equality

Lie Zip Blue Clan

Huaich Constitution Party

Mandhrithar Services

Fengalufon Gang

Progressive Party of LHS 142

San Tu State Network

Sokn allied

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can reduce the lockdown period.

These are 10 of the 738 minor factions are experiencing civil unrest:

Labour of GCRV 2743

Confederation of LP 355-51

Mafia of Fyrly

Crew of Cupen

Calennero Crew

Mafia of Ling Deti

Yao Tzu Exchange

Juipedi Purple Crew

Uadjarii Nobles

Movement for Gorringa Independents

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Aisling Duval Questions Convenience of Emperor's Recovery
Aisling Duval Questions Convenience of Emperor's Recovery \n \nIn a secretly recorded and unguarded discussion with one of her aides, Princess Aisling Duval is allegedly seen to question the motives of Senator Anders Blaine and other parties close to the Emperor.

« How is this possible? Am I not the most beloved person in the Empire? This is clear manoeuvring to make sure that Arissa becomes the heir. I can see her annoyingly haughty expression now. That Blaine thinks she will let him carry on doing what he wants . »

The recording has received universal condemnation from sources on both sides. Senator Blaine refused to comment directly, although an aide claimed that an investigation would be initiated.

Aisling Duval issued a statement denying the validity of the recording:

« This so-called recording is barely audible, and clearly a fabrication. I have not and would not say the despicable things portrayed in this horrid fantasy. My best technicians are already working to discover how this fraud has been perpetrated, and rest assured that the criminals will be caught. »


* Meet the Powers \u2013 Felicia Winters
Meet the Powers \u2013 Felicia Winters \n \nContinuing this GalNet exclusive series, political commentator Marcus Macmillan writes his opinion of some of the movers and shakers in 3301. In this fourth article he considers Shadow President Felicia Winters and her sudden rise to power.

With the disappearance of President Halsey and the earlier the murder of President Nigel Smeaton, Felicia Winters found herself thrust in charge of the Liberal Party. She inherited a political party in crisis and has had to work quickly to try and restore people's faith in her party.

As someone born and raised on Taylor Colony, Felicia Winters learned early on that when presented with difficult choices, humanity can't always be trusted to do the right thing. She sees it as her duty to push for the right choice, even if it's the hard choice.

Felicia Winters has already proved to be a versatile opponent, and in many opinion polls is running level with President Hudson. Many voters are growing concerned by the President's aggressive rhetoric and are turning to the Liberal Party to counter what they see as a road to war.


* Cerberus Plague Breakthrough
Cerberus Plague Breakthrough \n \nMedical personnel at Hart Station were unanimous in their praise for the many Commanders who delivered medicines to the Bast System as part of an ongoing effort to help those afflicted with the Cerberus Plague. A spokesperson at Hart Station released the following statement:

« We are immensely grateful to the 765 independent pilots who delivered medicine to the primary care facility here at Hart Station. Through their charitable efforts, we were able to bring relief to thousands of patients, and also to devote time we would not otherwise have had to our ongoing search for a cure. What's more, we think we may have made a breakthrough in that area. So to all those who contributed, we just want to say a heartfelt thank you. »

Apparently, patients at Hart Station who were offered Ceremonial Heike Tea showed some improvement in their health. When other patients experienced similar recoveries, the local team ran tests and sent samples to Carl Simmons, Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock in BD-02 4304, who is leading research into a cure. He offered the following brief statement:

« Patients were offered the tea simply to lift their spirits, but it apparently contains ingredients that can actually cure those afflicted with the pathogen. The tea is quite rare, however, and is only found in Heike, so I suspect it will be quite a challenge to gather the quantities that we need. »

We can only hope this news signals a turning point in the fight against the Cerberus Plague.


* Operation Davy Jones - The Voices of Dissent
Operation Davy Jones - The Voices of Dissent \n \nThe efforts of the Imperial forces engaged in « Operation Davy Jones » have continued this week, with the attackers keeping up the pressure on Archon Delaine's stretched and battered forces. However, while the pilots engaged in the operation remain optimistic after a series of local successes, the campaign has attracted its share of detractors.

\When I talk with my peers about the issues of the day, it isn't far away systems in the back of beyond that we concern ourselves with », Commander Edgar Starwalker, aligned with Arissa Lavigny-Duval, said in a brief interview. « Many of us know there is corruption right on our doorsteps, with dictators and credit-beholden corporations in charge of so many Imperial worlds. I think something should be done to bring about change at home!\

While the operation is being carried out by combined Imperial forces of varying allegiance, the core of the fleet is provided by Arissa Lavigny-Duval. As such, concerns about turmoil in the princess' territory have lead some to question the decision to commit large forces to an offensive against the Kumo Crew. More recently, outrage has been sparked by the attempts, initiated by supporters of Aisling Duval, to solicit the help of Federal Commanders in « Operation Davy Jones ».

When asked for comment, Commander Great Gig of Lavigny Legion's Velite Squadron had this to say: \When news travelled that Imperial Commanders were contacting the Federation for cooperation and help, I was saddened. Aren't we the mighty Empire of Achenar? Doesn't our history oppose their political and institutional corruption, their mind control through relentless propaganda and consumerism?\

For the past month, the eyes of the galaxy have been on the Pegasi Sector and « Operation Davy Jones ». Whether the Imperial forces manage to maintain their resolve in the face of stalwart defence and dissent at home remains to be seen.

* Further Outbreaks of Cerberus Plague
Further Outbreaks of Cerberus Plague \n \nWhile medical teams across the galaxy work to develop the quantities of antidote needed to eliminate the Cerberus Plague, fresh outbreaks of the disease are appearing in other systems. Our sources indicate that the following systems are currently affected by the Cerberus Plague:

Chongguls

Xamentii

G 139-50

Cantjarisni

Rajukru

HIP 10175

Amahu

Leerham

BD-11 4280

Louguala

Any independent pilots who wish to help those affected are encouraged to deliver medicines to the systems listed above.


* Ending Corruption at Home and Abroad
Ending Corruption at Home and Abroad \n \nConcerns have been raised that the ongoing war of liberation in the Pegasi sector, Operation Davy Jones, has left the Empire exposed to invasion and corruption. Addressing these concerns, Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval had these words for her constituents:

\With so many of our Imperial fleets engaged in battle, it is understandable that some are anxious about the security of our territory. I want to assure our citizens that local security forces are not impacted \u2013 in fact, over half of the Imperial fleet is held in reserve. Over the past weeks, a number of Imperial systems in our home space witnessed corrupt and repressive governments replaced by traditional patronages. Much of the heavy lifting has been done by Imperial reserve fleets. Our continued success in the Pegasi sector will soon liberate our citizens living there. To shirk our duties to our citizens, whether at home or abroad, is unacceptable. »

Commander Corrigendum


* Pegasi Intervention Sparks Debate at Home
Pegasi Intervention Sparks Debate at Home \n \nUnaffiliated supporters of Arissa Lavigny-Duval have today voiced concerns at rumours of an escalating intervention in the Pegasi Sector on the part of Lavigny's Legion.

Discussion of the the highly publicised plight of Imperial citizens living in volumes of space controlled by Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew dominated newsfeeds and social media throughout Kamadhenu over the weekend. Opinion is split on the humanitarian value of an intervention in a region perceived by some as extremely remote.

Speaking anonymously one commander said: \I don't understand why the Legion is wasting time with a foreign backwater like the Pegasi Sector. I'd never even heard of it before. We've got our own problems with corrupt Dictatorships and greedy Corporations right here at home. We need to clean up the Empire before we try cleaning up the whole Galaxy!\.

Anger erupted when it was revealed that diplomatic overtures had been made towards the Federation in regards to confronting the Kumo Crew.

It was later made clear that Lavigny's Legion itself took no part in any talks with envoys of Shadow President Felicia Winters or President Zachary Hudson. A diplomat for Aisling Duval's Aisling's Angels confirmed their own attendance at talks.

The suggestion that Arissa Lavigny-Duval's supporters might be pulled into joint operations with either Hudson or Winters has resurfaced deeply held anti-Federation sentiment, with reports of at least one commander plotting a course to Sol in a well armed vessel in response to the rumours.

Commander Edgar Starwalker


* Senator Patreus Supports Stability
Senator Patreus Supports Stability \n \nMany report that the Senate hasn't enjoyed such a positive atmosphere since the coronation of Hengist Duval nearly 70 years ago. This happy feeling continued today with Senator Denton Patreus taking his turn to congratulate the Emperor on his return to health and for the upcoming wedding.

« I have always spoken out for stability in the Empire and we could not have hoped for greater stability than the Emperor's recovery from his coma. The Empire has suffered with the absence of its father and some have attempted to take advantage of this for their own ends.

« I have been accused of doing the same, but I can assure everyone that my actions have always been in the best interests of the Empire. I categorically state here and before my esteemed colleagues, that I will do whatever is necessary to support the Emperor in his vision for the future. »

The Senator's speech was well received. However, some commentators have uncharitably noted that his campaign has flagged compared to his rivals', and that Senator Patreus is trying to set himself as a kingmaker to break the popularity deadlock between Arissa Lavigny-Duval and Aisling Duval.


* Meet the Powers \u2013 Zachary Hudson
Meet the Powers \u2013 Zachary Hudson \n \nContinuing this GalNet exclusive series, political commentator Marcus Macmillan writes his opinion of some of the movers and shakers in 3301. In this fifth article he analyses Federal President Zachary Hudson.

Republican President Zachary Hudson  became President after the disappearance of President Halsey and a vote of no confidence in the Senate. He has always been supportive of the military, and has recently announced his support for CQC Championship as a training and recruitment tool for the Federal Navy. He is also approving additional funds to begin upgrading and expanding the fleet to counter the threats he sees beyond the Federation's borders.

In common with most of his party, Hudson believes it is the government's duty to be as small a burden on the individual as possible. An extensive programme of tax reduction is already planned for most households within the Federation. This has proved popular, but not for those who relied on government support before his election.

He is also an advocate of personal freedom at any cost, although that is balanced by the requirement for citizens to be responsible for themselves.

For fun, the President regularly goes hunting on the many frontier worlds offering holiday activity.

Turot Creative Industries

Badbadzist Freedom Party

Varati Independent Union

Konohi Empire League

T'ieni Blue Galactic Group

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nIt's time for another weekly report on the struggles of the foremost political powers in the galaxy. While several regions saw a more peaceful week, there have also been some big developments. Read on to find out who benefited, and who is tumbling down the rankings.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval has expanded her influence into another system with close to no opposition and fortified her space against some well-coordinated undermining by her enemies, all while providing the core of the fleet attacking Archon Delaine, showcasing her ability to project her power over the whole of inhabited space. With her administration rising to the challenge and recovering from recent turmoil, Arissa's territory is set to return to its previous growth.

Aisling Duval maintains her #1 spot in galactic rankings. This is partly due to her continuing growth at a time when some of her rivals are seeing internal difficulties, and partly because the Princess enjoyed a very peaceful week, with few reports of hostile activity in her space and no opposition to her expansions. With vast resources and an efficient PR machine at her disposal, Aisling is set to keep her galactic poll standing for the foreseeable future.

Zachary Hudson has lost standing this week, in part due to somewhat lacklustre expansion efforts, which saw one of his three attempted expansions stopped by hostile wings. However, the efforts of Hudson's supporters to fortify his vast territory have been remarkably successful, again showcasing the President's ability to withstand heavy undermining of his systems.

Felicia Winters has seen her space come under heavy assault this week. While Winters' supporters are by now extremely proficient at defending her space against enemy undermining action, two setbacks have hurt the Shadow President's ranking this week. The attempt to expand her influence into the system of Liburodo has been stopped by overwhelming enemy action, and Edmund Mahon's expansion into Lugh has contested Felicia's hold over several other systems, further taxing her administration.

Zemina Torval lost the support of several financial interests a few weeks ago, and continues to suffer from the after-effects of that, making another rise in the rankings unlikely for now. At the same time, however, Torval makes good use of limited resources, easily expanding to another system and fortifying much of her space. While the Senator continues to see only moderate enemy action in her space, she has once more suffered due to a focused strike against Tanghpon, which successfully undermined her control of that system.

Denton Patreus had a very successful week. While his supporters are still directing much of their attention to Operation Davy Jones, the Senator managed to expand his influence into two more systems, and successfully fortify and even outdo Archon Delaine in the hotly contested system of Cuchua, which both men have attempted to prepare for future expansion.

Edmund Mahon saw his quick rise to galactic prominence suffer some push-back this week. While his attempt to expand into Lugh was successful and his supporters successfully fortified his systems, the massive surge in enemy activity against the Alliance politician's forces may signal future difficulties, and his expansion into Lugh could trigger more conflict with Felicia Winters and Zachary Hudson. For now, however, Mahon's #3 standing is well deserved, and he enjoys a steady growth in support not enjoyed by his rivals.

Li Yong-Rui expanded into no fewer than five new systems this week. This, along with his successful fortification efforts, easily justifies his rise in galactic standings. Sirius Gov has so far seen few attempts by its rivals to stop its efforts, and it's not entirely clear how the corporation will cope once it's seriously challenged, but it's clear that Li Yong-Rui's organisation will not be returning to the bottom of the galactic ranking any time soon.

Archon Delaine is still in a difficult position, but his supporters have managed to limit the damage done by the Imperial attackers this week. While Operation Davy Jones succeeded in undermining the Kumo Crew's control of five key systems, better organised fortification efforts have actually left the pirate lord with more resources at his disposal than he had the week before. With no new expansions and the continuing assault by huge numbers of Imperial pilots, the pirate band is still in danger, but five weeks into the offensive they continue to resist and to test the resolve of their attackers.

Pranav Antal has spread the vision of Utopia into four new systems this week. This is an unprecedented surge for what has been one of the galaxy's less prominent powers. Utopians appear to credit this unexpected push to a new group of Commanders who are currently unidentified and not in communication with the rest of Pranav Antal's forces. If that force, nicknamed by some « The Many », continues to support the Simguru, then Antal's rise to #9 in galactic rankings might yet be sustained. Further rise may be compromised by an ambitious attempt by Utopians to establish a commune in the distant colony of Sothis, which is sure to tax the organisation's scant resources.


* Smuggling on the Rise in Conflict-Strewn Pegasi Sector
Smuggling on the Rise in Conflict-Strewn Pegasi Sector \n \n\Let's just say I'm not flying a small ship anymore!\ laughed one Commander, pledged to the Kumo Crew, when asked about the ongoing conflict in the Pegasi sector. \We all know that these Imperial types have been flying around and ransacking ships in our space, but what have they actually achieved? Archon Delaine has consistently shown us that, under his leadership, we can repel any fleet and make an absurd number of credits in the process. Who is really losing this fight?\

It is certainly hard to argue with the Commander's logic. The combined Imperial fleets have continually undermined Kumo Crew territory, but they are yet to make any significant headway into smuggler-controlled space. Reports indicate that illegal contraband has risen at alarming rates since the conflict began, and an unusually large quantity of credits has made its way into Kumo Crew space from their aggressors' territory.

When asked where these seemingly never-ending credits were flowing from, the Commander had this to say: \I'm a supplier of goods, some legal and some...not-so legal. People don't care about a line in the sand \u2013 they want their trinkets and toys. War is good for business, and business is good.\

With no end in sight, it certainly seems one group will be making the most of the situation while it lasts.

* Ex-Governor Joel Xander Charged with Venality and Abuse of Office
Ex-Governor Joel Xander Charged with Venality and Abuse of Office \n \nFederal prosecutor Kerstin Marling has brought charges against the former Governor of BD-22 3572, Joel Xander, in the Federal court in Rhea.

Marling stated that she has evidence that Xander had been receiving financial support from local leaders King Justice II and Supreme Leader Anxo Lino of BD-22 3573 Flag, which has led to a dramatic decrease of Federation popularity in the sector.

« It is of utmost importance to show to all the poor people who have suffered because of this man's corruption that this was not official Federal policy, but the work of an individual, who will be treated as a criminal for his deeds. »


* Meet the Powers \u2013 Denton Patreus
Meet the Powers \u2013 Denton Patreus \n \nSenator Denton Patreus is the latest subject in this sixth article from political commentator Marcus Macmillan about the movers and shakers in 3301.

Senator Patreus is often seen as the muscular aspect of the Imperial Senate. He is one of the more powerful senators (although lagging behind the heavyweights of Senators Lavigny-Duval and Zamina Torval) and enjoys great loyalty from his followers. This is in part due to his record of low taxation funded through aggressive economic and military conquests.

While some have accused the Senator of unethical behaviour for his strong-arm tactics, others respond that if governments put themselves into debt then they only have themselves to blame. His shrewd policies have allowed him to assemble deep credit reserves and a formidable fleet, providing him with power beyond what his standing might indicate.

Hailing from Eotienses, he is a charming and charismatic leader who prefers to govern from his Majestic-class Interdictor called 'Imperial Freedom'. During the Emperor's illness, he called for the Imperial throne to pass along lines of popularity rather than blood. Since the Emperor's recovery he has steadfastly supported Hengist Duval, but many wonder if this attempted break from tradition has limited his popularity in the wider population.


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report
GalNet Weekly Conflict Report \n \nThis weekly transmission takes the latest GalNet data and lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy. (*).

These are 10 of the 12,761 minor factions involved in a civil war:

Ruchbah Progressive Party

Lwalama Patron's Principles

Mapor Incorporated

Independent Khawchuang Green Party

HR 2283 Independents

Monarchy of Luyten 205-128

Confederation of Caelottixa

Sosoling Alliance

Hemaskas Corp.

Arimavante Constitution Party

Civil wars take place between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets like starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

The following are 10 of the 2,415 minor factions at war:

Crimson Netcoms Co

Quiness for Equality

GQ Virginis General Corporation

Xolotl and Co

United Ao Progressive Party

Revolutionary 16 c Ursae Majoris Future

HIP 92342 Silver Fortune Comms

HIP 8564 Corp.

Irusamara Drug Empire

Union of Huveang De Alliance

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, standard of living, wealth and security are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war will end in a ceasefire.

* Meet the Powers \u2013 Li Yong-Rui
Meet the Powers \u2013 Li Yong-Rui \n \nSirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui is the focus of this seventh article from political commentator Marcus Macmillan about the movers and shakers in 3301.

In this week's historical article from Sima Kalhana, she wrote about the founding of the Sirius Corporation. The Li dynasty's involvement with the Sirius Corporation can be traced back to the company's founding almost 800 years ago.

By the age of 25, Yong-Rui  had earned doctorates in physics, politics and economics. He was hired by Sirius straight from college. He then quickly made his way up the ranks, and at the tender age of 35, Yong-Rui was made Vice President of Forecasting.

He has a proven track record in business, but has also demonstrated significant insight in the fuzzier elements and in particular how to provide effective government. With these skills he was considered the ideal candidate for Sirius Corporation's new Sirius Gov division.


* The Sim-Archive of Antal Opens to Visitors
The Sim-Archive of Antal Opens to Visitors \n \nFor the first time in the history of Utopia, the famed Sim-Archive, located in Antal, is being opened to outside visitors.

The archive is a vast collection of memories stored as sims, allowing others to relive the experiences of Utopian pilgrims in the form of vivid virtual reality experiences. In the past, those sims have been used to educate Utopians and to reform dissidents within the community.

Today, pilots from across the galaxy can buy Utopian sims from the more limited, public section of the Sim-Archive. In a brief statement, Simguru Pranav Antal urged all-comers to travel to Antal.

\What we are offering to our brothers and sisters throughout the galaxy is an opportunity to learn, to experience, to live through the memories of thousands. From childlike wonder, through crushing terror, to unrestrained joy, the sims we offer are not just a means of entertainment, but the purest, most direct tool for achieving empathy and consensus.\


* Fight Against Cerberus Plague Continues
Fight Against Cerberus Plague Continues \n \nThe drive to deliver quantities of Ceremonial Heike Tea to Hart Station in the Bast System continues, as the starport's medical teams work around the clock to create as much of the Cerberus Plague antidote as they can. According to Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, the rare tea is the only substance that can counter the virulent effects of the disease.

Independent pilots who are in a position to help with the effort are reminded that the Union Of Bast Liberals is offering incentives to pilots who deliver Ceremonial Heike Tea, which can only be purchased in Brunel City Station in Heike, to Hart Station.


* Remembering the Antares Incident
Remembering the Antares Incident \n \nContinuing GalNet's exclusive series highlighting key events in human history, historian Sima Kalhana remembers the Antares Incident.

In last week's article about the Sirius Corporation, I described the Antares iIncident as one of the corporation's greatest failures. Until the recent disappearance of Starship One, this was considered the most infamous spacegoing  accident of all time.

The Highliner Antares was to be the first of a new type of fast, comfortable liner, making a trip in hours rather than the weeks that were common at the time, and offering a previously unseen level of luxury \u2013 something we are accustomed to in the top-class liners of today. It was the first ship to use a production version of a new type of hyperdrive, a predecessor to the modern fast hyperdrives.

The Antares vanished during its maiden voyage in the Sirius system in 3251, with many celebrity guests on board. The event is poignantly remembered in this quote from the Federal Times:

« Your reporter watched the departure of Antares on her maiden voyage, the monolayer streamers glinting in the harsh light of Sirius as she moved gently away from the orbital habitat and out to launch range. Spacemen talk of a graveyard of lost ships, a place where all who lose their lives in the colossal drive to colonise the galaxy rest in gentle luxury.

« We can be sure that the great Highliner Antares is now in their company. »

The exact cause of the accident was never properly determined. The final report indicated that it was most likely caused by the unlucky failure of a single component during the start of the jump, causing a small fire in a key part of the drive that resulted in a massive explosion and consequent misjump at the same time. There were, of course, a great many fanciful explanations, too.

Since the accident, no confirmed wreckage of the ship has ever been found, although several claims of discovery have been made over the years. Combined with the lack of a definitive cause, this has led to considerable speculation and many conspiracy theories concerning what actually occurred.

The final safety report into the incident found there were insufficient safety precautions within the internal drive systems. This delayed the commercial introduction of these drives for several years, damaging the Sirius Corporation, and ultimately resulting in the fitting of many additional safety features to these new hyperdrives. It was later speculated that the deaths of those on the Highliner Antares effectively saved the lives of many more in the subsequent decades, as the number of ships that went missing was measurably reduced, and the new drives proved to be much more reliable than the earlier, slower drives they replaced.


* Imperial Commanders Closing in on Secret Smuggling
Imperial Commanders Closing in on Secret Smuggling \n \nRumour has it that several Imperial Commanders are closing in on a well-known smuggling route between the Torval and Delaine owned systems. Imperial slaves are illegal in Delaine space but sell for a small fortune on the black market. The Empire hates this because it takes what they consider indentured servants and citizens from a life of Imperial service to a life of forced labour. Commanders who use the secretive route have plenty to say about the prospect of impending Imperial intervention, with Commander Infinity+1 saying:

\Ain't it funny how we're s'posed to be the bad guys, but the Empire has so many slaves they're practically giving them away!\

When pressed to reveal the systems he runs between, Infinity stated, \I'm not telling you about my favorite route, but let me just say thank you to the honorable Zemina Torval\

Profits allegedly run towards 4,000 credits per slave. Only time will tell if the Imperials can break the back of this illegal trade route and round up the smuggling ring, but one thing is certain \u2013 until the Empire fixes the problem of Archon Delaine, there will be other runs to take its place.


* A Treaty in Tatters
A Treaty in Tatters \n \nLegate Andariel, of Aisling's 13th Legion, has officially ended the ceasefire between the 13th Legion and Winters' Wolves. Following a number of reports of Winters' supporters undermining Aisling's control systems, the Legate made the decision to dissolve the treaty. A press conference was held aboard Smoot Station in Chona, where Andariel explained his position:

« It has become apparent that Winters' Wolves, while claiming to honour the treaty, have done no such thing. I have received many reports of Winters' supporters, some of them well known Wolves, undermining our control systems. I cannot stand by while Winters undermines all that we have worked for in the name of Aisling Duval \u2013 doing so would make the 13th Legion appear weak. »

While no names have been disclosed, it is clear that these breaches of the treaty are unacceptable. The treaty was originally signed on July 17th 3301 to allow the 13th to focus on the Imperial offensive against Archon Delaine, with mixed responses from other Aisling factions. With Delaine's forces all but melting away, it has been speculated that the 13th Legion is using false-flagging tactics to get the treaty removed so they can resume hostilities with Winters.

* Meet the Powers \u2013 Zemina Torval
Meet the Powers \u2013 Zemina Torval \n \nSenator Zemina Torval is the subject of this article from political commentator Marcus Macmillan about the movers and shakers in 3301.

In many ways Senator Torval represents the solid and traditional politics of the Imperial Senate. She is seen as a paradox by some, particularly with regard to her views on Imperial slavery. She adopts the position that tradition expects but that many fail to achieve in the care of the millions of slaves from her business interests. She can be vocal in condemning those who fail to take proper care of their slaves, but she is equally open about how they form the foundation of the Empire.

She takes the long and more considered approach to amassing power. She lacks the impetuousness of Patreus, but is quite willing to work with him to achieve her goals. She prefers diplomacy to force, but has a substantial military fleet  capable of handling most situations.

Her desire for power is more than personal ambition: she is, in a sense, the matriarch of a developing dynasty. Torval focuses her energy on building a legacy for future generations. Even though she was born wealthy, she still possesses a strong work ethic and will labour  tirelessly to get things done.

While her time is dominated by her senatorial responsibilities and business concerns (she is, famously, the controlling shareholder in Mastopolos Mining), Torval tries to find the time to be with family, who are very important to her. In her younger days she enjoyed hunting, but that pastime is now limited to her rivals in business and the Senate.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic states for a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

Here are 10 of the 3,995 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Gyton's Hope Resistance

Beldarkri Constitution Party

Progressive Party of No Myoin

Obambivas Netcoms Ltd

Codorain Network

New HIP 60953 Constitution Party

Gender Flag

Obambivas United Industries

Narakapani Exchange

Lactonacaya Empire League

When in boom, the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have doubled effects on influence. It can also positively increase the minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 93 minor factions currently experiencing an economic bust:

Wolf 1301 Crimson Electronics

LTT 9097 Gold Advanced Co

LHS 1197 Gold Family

HR 692 Empire League

HR 826 Movement

Official AZ Cancri Dominion

Mob of Groombridge 34

NLTT 12619 Confederacy

Forculus Ltd

Values Party of Jitani

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Five Killed in Shuttle Accident
Five Killed in Shuttle Accident \n \nA  Sirius Corporation shuttle was destroyed this morning when its docking computer failed on approach to Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system. While such failures aren't unheard of, they are rare, especially among smaller craft.

Elaine Boyd from the Federal Times asked a Sirius Corporation representative how the company was able to determine the cause of the accident so quickly. She was told:

« The telemetry from the shuttle provided clear evidence of a stall in the computer's operation as the vessel approached the docking port. The boost protocol should have been disabled but was instead activated, causing the shuttle to crash into the station. »

The representative stated  that the crash would be investigated further, and in particular why the software failed in this instance.

Everyone onboard the shuttle was killed including Sean Richards, a senior consultant engineer who helped to compile the incident report on the recent disappearance of Starship One. Richards had also formed part of the task force some 50 years earlier with the Antares enquiry.


* The Eve of the Wedding
The Eve of the Wedding \n \nThe atmosphere here on Capitol is electric. The whole city is abuzz with what some commentators have declared 'The Wedding of the Century'. Street parties are in full swing in every Imperial system , but none compare to the grand events underway here at the birthplace of the Empire, especially within the Fragrant City as it is now known.

Dignitaries from every major population centre in the Empire have arrived over the past week, and now it is the turn of the foreign dignitaries to arrive with much fanfare. Shadow President Winters is representing the Federation, her business-like attire contrasting with the bright colours of the welcoming officials.

Notable by his absence was Federal President Zachary Hudson. While the Secretary of External Affairs will represent the Federation at the wedding , many have interpreted President Hudson's absence as a slight \u2013 one that may well colour Federal and Imperial relations in the future.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

Here are 10 of the 350 minor factions in lockdown:

Kawarawana Gold General Systems

Priva Industry

Bellaung Empire Pact

Mullag Democrats

Bunda Bridge and Co

United Ngbato First

Family of Wira

United Barathaona Resistance

Kalvante Monarchy

Kutkha Free

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can reduce the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 700 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

HIP 92915 Silver Cartel

He Pola Empire Pact

LHS 1541 Gold Netcoms Comms

Yan Musu Patron's Principles

BD+47 2112 Gang

Ross 129 Silver Council

Noatiaca Purple Drug Empire

Misisture Electronics Group

Social HIP 2725 Green Party

Revolutionary Party of Gluscheimr

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Pirates Targeting Medical Supply Ships
Pirates Targeting Medical Supply Ships \n \nAccording to officials at Hart Station, medical supply ships transporting the Cerberus Plague antidote from the starport are being targeted by pirates. Naturally, these attacks are substantially undermining attempts to eliminate the disease, which continues to affect a number of systems. One official said:

« It's just despicable. I wouldn't expect compassion from pirates, of course. But don't they understand that this affects them, too? If the Cerberus Plague isn't eliminated, it could spread to every corner of the galaxy. Everyone will suffer, even the pirates. Do they think they're immune or something? »

In an effort to combat the threat posed by the pirates, the Union of Bast Liberals has started offering rewards to those who eliminate any of the pirate vessels. With luck, this will allow the medical ships to deliver the cure to those who so desperately need it.


* GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots
GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots \n \nThis weekly report indicates some of the minor factions enduring significant health issues such as famine and outbreaks (*).

Outbreaks have been reported by the following minor factions:

Rajukru

HIP 10175

Amahu

Leerham

Cantjarisni

BD-11 4280

Louguala

Like famines, outbreaks cause a major disruption to the inhabitants' standard of living. Resupply of medicines and related trade contracts are needed to end the outbreak. Due to the state of emergency combat missions and activities provide no effect on influence.

* Emperor Hengist Duval Dead
Emperor Hengist Duval Dead \n \nIt is with a heavy heart that we report that Emperor Hengist Duval died en route to the Imperial Navy Medical Facility near the Imperial Palace. Confirmation of the news came from Chancellor Anders Blaine, who appeared visibly upset.

He confirmed that the Emperor died after being stabbed by a member of the congregation. Chancellor Blaine refused to provide any details of the attacker, but stated that a full investigation was underway.

A source from the Imperial Intelligence Service told us that the attacker was a member of Senator Denton Patreus's party attending the wedding. The Senator was unavailable for comment.

In the streets, the Imperial Naval Infantry   has started ushering people home as the official period of mourning begins.


* Emperor Hengist Duval Attacked During Wedding
Emperor Hengist Duval Attacked During Wedding \n \nThe city is in a state of shock following news that the Emperor was attacked by a high-ranking official during the wedding ceremony.

Details of the attack are scant at the moment as a total comms blackout was imposed throughout the immediate area following the incident. One of our sources has indicated that the assailant was killed, but that he managed to injure the Emperor before he died. We do not know how serious the Emperor's injuries are, but our hope is that he makes a swift recovery.

Along the route of the procession, millions of citizens and slaves who had been celebrating the grand occasion wait in stunned silence for news of their beloved Emperor. We wait with them.


* Morning of the Wedding
Morning of the Wedding \n \nEven though the ceremony won't start until midday, well-wishers have been lining the procession route throughout the night to ensure they have a good position. The weather here is clear and warm for this auspicious day, and billions of people are expected to watch the event live through syndicated entertainment feeds. Even the people of the Alliance have been getting into the spirit of the celebrations by adding shiny accessories to their usually dreary 'fashions'.

The Imperial Navy is out in force, with the Naval Infantry in their finest dress whites providing security and a spectacle along the route. This reporter was lucky enough to walk the route with the elite guards who had been selected to escort the procession. When asked what this task meant to her, Sergeant Jenner replied:

« Well, obviously this is the greatest honour of our careers. I've served in the Naval Infantry for over 30 years and this is simply amazing. Most of the troops will admit that, although they signed up for combat duty, being assigned ceremonial duties of this nature makes them proud. »


* GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming
GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming \n \nIn the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT) the GalNet monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled.

Any pilots who operate for any of the powers should ensure they deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time for their activities to be registered.


* Further Outbreaks of Cerberus Plague
Further Outbreaks of Cerberus Plague \n \nWhile medical teams across the galaxy work to deliver the Cerberus Plague antidote to systems affected by the disease, fresh outbreaks of the pathogen are appearing in other systems. According to recent reports, the following systems are currently affected by the Cerberus Plague:

Altair

39 Tauri

Kamorin

Delta Phoenicis\t

Kappa Ophiuchi\t

Murung\t\t\t\t

LTT 14850\t

Gali\t

Cauani\t

LTT 6705

Watha

Asgaa

Svent

Any independent pilots who wish to help are encouraged to eliminate the pirates targeting medical supply convoys in the Bast system. The Union of Bast Liberals is currently offering rewards to pilots who destroy these pirates.


* Cerberus Plague Continues to Affect Starports
Cerberus Plague Continues to Affect Starports \n \nAlthough a cure for the Cerberus Plague has been found, the disease has not yet been eradicated, and it continues to wreak havoc in certain systems.

The following systems have been affected by the plague:

Cantjarisni

Rajukru

HIP 10175

Amahu

Leerham

BD-11 4280

Louguala

In these systems, the following station services are unavailable:

Re-arming

Market

Bulletin board

Docking

Shipyard

Outfitting

Black market

Authorities in these systems have reported that services will remain offline until the Cerberus Plague has been either contained or eliminated.


* Gutamaya Shipyards Reinstates Restrictions
Gutamaya Shipyards Reinstates Restrictions \n \nLast month, Gutamaya Shipyards temporarily lifted the rank-related restrictions on the Imperial Clipper and Imperial Courier, thereby allowing any independent pilot with an active rank in the Imperial Navy to purchase and fly one of the vessels. Following news of the Emperor's assassination, however, Gutamaya Shipyards has decided to withdraw this offer, and to reinstate the default restrictions on all their ships.


* Official Period of Mourning Begins
Official Period of Mourning Begins \n \nChancellor Anders Blaine held a press conference in front of the entrance to the Hall of Martyrs and declared the beginning of the official period of mourning for Emperor Hengist Duval:

« It is my solemn duty to officially mark the first day of the four-week period of mourning for our beloved Emperor. As is customary, the body of the Emperor will be placed in the vestibule of the Hall of Martyrs for public viewing and the paying of respect. »

The Chancellor refused to answer questions from the assembled reporters concerning the investigation into the assassination. When asked about the succession, he replied that the matter will be handled in the Senate once the funeral has taken place.

Following tradition, the Chancellor and invited dignitaries wore the black sash of mourning. These will be worn throughout the mourning period and then burned during the internment ceremony.

The Hall of Martyrs was constructed over 600 years ago following the victory against the Federation in the first conflict between the two superpowers. It is open to the public only during the mourning period of those who are to be entombed there. The vast and exquisitely crafted hall beneath the Imperial Palace contains 16,032 obsidian pillars, and only the most honoured members of Imperial society are laid to rest there.

* Fight Against Cerberus Plague Gains Ground
Fight Against Cerberus Plague Gains Ground \n \nThe fight against the Cerberus Plague, which to date has claimed thousands of lives, appears to be gaining ground. Following the efforts of medical teams to deliver the antidote to systems affected by the disease, reports have reached us that the plague has been eradicated from the following systems:

Dajoar

Bastes

Maheou Ti-

Eleu-

Ochoeng

20 Ophiuchi

Una

Santjalan

BD-02 4304

Chongguls

Xamentii

G 139-50

Meanwhile, the effort to help those suffering from the disease continues.


* Chancellor Blaine Issues Statement
Chancellor Blaine Issues Statement \n \nWith no clear successor to the Emperor, Chancellor Blaine has accepted the task of governing the Empire until the succession has been determined. He reiterated his statement that the matter would be resolved after Emperor's funeral. He then revealed more about the investigation into the regicide:

« Officers from the Imperial Guard and Imperial Intelligence Security Service have begun their investigation and are being provided with the resources they need.

« The assassin has been identified as Brendan Paul Darius. Senator Patreus has confirmed that the man was a member of his entourage, and the Senator is helping with the investigation. Darius killed the Emperor in a savage attack using a concealed blade, and a separate investigation has been launched to determine how he was able to sneak a weapon into the Emperor's presence.

« Darius was killed by the Emperor's Guard during the attack, and we have as yet been unable to determine his motive for the murder. »

For the remainder of the session, the gathered senators offered support and words of condolence to the Imperial family.


* Children of Liberty call out Alliance Hypocrisy
Children of Liberty call out Alliance Hypocrisy \n \nA group calling itself the 'Children of Liberty' has made a public statement concerning the Alliance and what they call its « rampant hypocrisy ». The group claims that a \huge gulf\ exists between the Alliance's professed goals and values and the reality present in many of its member systems.

\For an organization that purports to be devoted to the ideals of liberty and self-determination\ the release stated, \the Alliance certainly tolerates a great deal of despotism and tyranny within its own borders. It's about time the Alliance addressed the rampant hypocrisy of allowing dictatorships \u2013 as well as other restrictive, undemocratic forms of government \u2013 membership into their supposed bastion of freedom and liberty.\

The statement went on to list a number of Alliance-sponsored autocracies in various systems, and called on the Alliance and its supporters to sponsor serious democratic reform in said systems by backing democratically-aligned factions over autocratic ones.

* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nAfter an exciting week it's time for another report on the political manoeuvrings and struggles of the galaxy's most prominent political players. Hostilities have flared up, so read on to find out who benefitted from the chaos and who has been a victim of it.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval used this week to recover from the turmoil her administration had fallen into, with her supporters preparing several systems for expansion and undertaking widespread fortification throughout her space. This impressive defensive effort has assured Arissa's rise to the #1 spot in the GalNet rankings, despite the successful enemy undermining of Cook and He Xingo.

Aisling Duval has suffered an unexpected drop to #3 in the galactic rankings this week. An increase in hostile activity in Aisling's space, and the successful enemy action in her system of Syntheng, has pushed her administration into turmoil. This downturn in the face of a relatively minor offensive on her space calls into question Aisling's ability to maintain control over her rapidly growing sphere of influence.

Zemina Torval has struggled in recent weeks, and her drop in rankings is certainly understandable. The Senator had her control of nearly half a dozen systems successfully undermined, and her only expansion attempt, in Mannoda, failed. While Torval's resource reserves and her supporters' impressive fortification efforts were enough to stave off turmoil, she will be facing a difficult week if the hostilities in her space continue.

Denton Patreus has used the recent weeks to recover from the sharp drop in support his organisation has seen. With the Kumo Crew distracted and under pressure from Operation Davy Jones, and Federal corsairs focusing on Zemina Torval, the Senator's forces surged ahead, rapidly expanding Patreus' sphere of influence and securing a rise in the rankings for their ambitious leader. It remains to be seen if this impressive recovery can be maintained if Denton's systems once again come under attack from his rivals.

Zachary Hudson had a successful week. With expansion paused due to recent turmoil, his supporters completed an impressive fortification program throughout much of the President's sphere of influence. This meant that only one of Hudson's systems was successfully undermined by the enemy, and it gives the Federation politician an impressive reserve of resources to draw upon.

Felicia Winters has had her space heavily infiltrated by enemy wings for weeks now, and her supporters always staunchly defended her systems. However, this past week saw a sharp increase in hostilities in the Shadow President's powerbase, straining her modest forces. With her grip on much of her space undermined by rivals, Winters' administration falls into turmoil, and it's only through impressive effort from her supporters that just one of her systems is at risk.

Edmund Mahon has shown that his organisation has the ability to grow stronger even in the face of extreme difficulties. The Alliance politician's rise to #2 in the GalNet rankings is well earned this week, with his resilience to heavy hostile action attributed to a successful fortification program and a series of expansions into highly profitable systems in the recent weeks. While both of those factors give Mahon a good reserve of resources to draw on, his enemies successfully undermined eight of his systems in what likely heralds a period of increased hostility, likely to tax the rapidly expanding organisation.

Li Yong-Rui's Sirius Gov has retained its high galactic standing despite a sudden increase in attacks on its systems. While the ability of Li Yong-Rui's supporters to withstand the added pressure is impressive, the successful undermining of two their systems and widespread hostilities throughout many of their border systems likely spell an end to a period of relative peace for the organisation. As tensions with Sirius' neighbours flare up, the corporate government is sure to come under increased pressure from without.

Archon Delaine and his Kumo Crew continue to defend against the Imperial offensive \u2013 dubbed 'Operation Davy Jones' \u2013 which is now in its fifth week. While the pirate lord's grip on his claimed territory has been severely challenged, with one of his expansion attempts stopped in its tracks and his control over more than a dozen systems undermined, there is yet no victory in sight for his attackers. With a relatively small powerbase and key systems fortified against aggression, the Kumo Crew remains unbroken, having avoided falling into turmoil and even securing one new system, Kakmbuta.

Pranav Antal has experienced an amazing surge in support in the recent weeks. Emboldened, his supporters claimed several new systems for Utopia, including Ewah, where a fierce battle with the local opposition forces took place. While attempts to claim the distant Sothis faltered and expansion into Lidpar was countered by staunch enemy action, it seems clear that Utopia will continue to grow at a quick pace. The one difficulty facing Pranav Antal's organisation is somewhat lacklustre fortification efforts, which may expose Utopian systems to enemy action, should hostilities flare up.

* Millions Pay Respects
Millions Pay Respects \n \nMillions of senators, patrons, clients, citizens and slaves from across the Empire are making the journey to the Hall of Martyrs on Capitol in the Achenar system to pay their respects to the late Emperor. The queue to view the Emperor's body already stretches several miles from the Imperial Palace, with the waiting time now measured in days. Naturally, senators, patrons and clients each have their own entrances.

Palace officials have announced that the viewings will continue, at all hours, until the final funeral preparations begin on the eve of the funeral. Volunteers from the palace staff will aid the mourners and keep the line moving.

The Imperial Naval Infantry will also be stationed along the ever-lengthening line \u2013 not because of security concerns, but to ensure the welfare of the waiting people. The population of the city swelled beyond normal capacity during the wedding celebrations, and the influx of mourners has pushed the city to bursting point. Along with the military deployment, local residents are providing those in the queue with food and drink.

Those unable to make the journey to Capitol have created memorials in their own cities, starports and colonies, and are assembling to give their respects.

* The Reign of Emperor Hengist Duval
The Reign of Emperor Hengist Duval \n \nIn respect of the assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval the planned article for this week has been moved to next week so that historian Sima Kalhana relates some of the key moments from his life.

Emperor Hengist Duval was the 15th in the Imperial Duval bloodline to lead the Empire and he saw a great deal of change in his comparatively short reign. He was born in 3163, only a few days before the death of his grandfather Hender Saik Duval. Some claim that the spirit of Hender had already passed to Hengist such were the similarities in looks and manner noted in Hengist's later years.

When his father, Hesketh Duval, died in 3233, Hengist assumed his place on the throne. The live broadcast of the coronation created an impression of a serene transition. However lurking beneath this appearance lay significant tensions. Most significant of which was the growing power of the Senate which had developed during the extended period of his father's illness.  A parallel with the situation with Hengist's coma can be seen in recent months.

At the start of his reign the cold war between the Empire and the Federation was starting to thaw, a process which continued for decades, although friction has recently resumed with the rise of certain powers like President Hudson and Senator Patreus.

Hengist's reign witnessed a major technological advancement with the introduction of the new frame shift drive. This sped up travel between stars systems and even inside systems by an incredible margin. It created a more quickly shifting political, military and commercial landscape as reacting or causing changing became much easier.

Hengist fell ill early in 3300, and he managed to continue light duties throughout the first half of the year. His sickness worsened as the year progressed and during this time he remained in seclusion with only rare visits to the Senate. At the turn of 3301 he slipped into a coma. Many expected him to not awaken from the coma and it was a great surprise when he recovered several months later.

Near the close of 3300, Hengist decreed that his only legitimate child, Harold (who is Aisling Duval's unmarried father), was not of sound mind and so unfit for rule, and in any case had no legitimate children himself. Following this announcement Arissa Lavigny-Duval declared that she was the illegitimate child of Hengist. The Emperor supported this claim by announcing his forthcoming marriage with Arissa's mother, Florence Lavigny, and was expected to formally adopt Arissa and cement her claim to the throne.

With his murder and the marriage not completed the succession to the imperial throne is again not clear cut and many fear the potential instability this could cause to the Empire if not decided quickly after the Emperor's funeral.


* Leaked Footage of Emperor's Assassination
Leaked Footage of Emperor's Assassination \n \nIn a move sending shockwaves of revulsion throughout the Empire, an independent newsfeed, Russell Networks, based in the Tulill system, has broadcast what is claimed to be a holographic recording of the assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval.

Imperial networks are refusing to show the footage and all levels of imperial society are outraged at this insult to the Emperor's memory. The recording's authenticity hasn't been confirmed, but it does clearly show someone who looks like Brendan Paul Darius attacking the Emperor. As the Emperor passes by Senator Patreus' entourage Darius is seen to lunge from the group. He then stabs the Emperor several times with a blade and inflicting severe facial injuries until being taken down by the nearest guards. In it, others in Patreus's entourage, including Senator Patreus himself, appear to move to try to stop the attacker, and do appear to be genuinely surprised and shocked.

Chancellor Anders Blaine condemned the broadcast in a statement and refused to comment on its veracity.


* Portrait of a Bounty Hunter
Portrait of a Bounty Hunter \n \nSocial historians sometimes have a tendency to focus on the rich and powerful, forgetting that the people who dwell on society's margins can also have an impact on the shape of the galaxy. In this new series, we take a look at some of recent history's less well-known figures, and shine a light on their unique achievements. Our first episode explores the life of the bounty hunter Ziva Eschel.

Ziva Eschel began her career in the Federal State Police, spending ten years as a Viper pilot in the Beta Hydri system. She left the force shortly after she and her partner were imprisoned by the Judas Syndicate on the infamous Black Mausoleum. Eschel escaped with her life but her partner was executed, and, due to the unique status of the Mausoleum, the Beta Hydri authorities were unable to bring his killers to justice.

After quitting the Federal State Police, Eschel acquired a lease on an old Sidewinder and began a career as a bounty hunter operating out of Beta Hydri. Her approach relied more on careful planning and preparation than flashy flying, but she nevertheless progressed to larger and more dangerous scores, upgrading her ships and finally settling on the Dragon Queen, a highly customised Fer-de-lance.

Eschel is not a public person and has eschewed several invitations to syndicate her operations to 'Federation's Most Wanted', but in police and bounty hunting circles she is known to be both cautious and dangerous, and also meticulous in adhering to the law \u2013 a rare trait in her profession.

Eschel and the Dragon Queen were last seen heading for Jackson's Lighthouse, possibly in pursuit of the notorious Red Hourglass.


* Where's Walden Now?
Where's Walden Now? \n \nToday marks 36 years since the last 'Walden Day', the annual celebration of the great leader across all four continents of Lave, where prefects, primes and factors would try to outdo each other with how much love they could show the planet's ruler.

Lave in 3301 does its best to forget the past. Years of relative prosperity and capitalist competition between the LFO, the Defence Party and the Workers of Lave reflect the different social classes of the planet's regions. Each formed out of different parts of the old regime and its adversaries. But the question remains, what actually happened to Doctor Hans Walden?

The holovid footage of his execution has been replayed countless times on hundreds of programmes. Some preach conspiracy, others see tampering, but most agree that Walden's clone research, journals, and the numerous patents sold to Imperial contractors bearing his name point to his having experimented with the duplication of his own genetics.

Since 3265, the government has released no evidence of hidden scientific laboratories on Lave or any of the plotted asteroids in the system. Rumours of a secret colony on Lave II have never been confirmed, either, but the rumours keep resurfacing. Yes, Walden was executed during a live vidscreen broadcast...but was that the only Walden? Could there be others, lurking out there on a nearby planet, waiting to return? If there are any clones left, forgetting the past won't help us deal with the future.


* Patreus Reacts Angrily to Crowd's Taunts
Patreus Reacts Angrily to Crowd's Taunts \n \nSome elements of the lower-level Imperial political scene have challenged Senator Denton Patreus to explain his connection to Brendan Paul Darius, the assassin responsible for the murder of the Emperor during the wedding ceremony with Florence Lavigny. Since the revelation of the assassin's identity the senator has steadfastly refused to comment, but responded angrily to accusations from a vocal minority in the crowd outside the senate.

« The notion that I might somehow be linked with the murder of our most loved Emperor is offensive. It does bring dishonour and shame upon me that a man in my employ could perform such a heinous act, but it was certainly done without my knowledge. The thought that I allowed such a man near his august presence torments me. »

He also added that the full resources of his office were being made available to the officers in the investigation and that he would aid them in any way he could.

More responsible commentators agree that the accusations are ridiculous. Speculation remains however as to why the man killed the Emperor and whether he was acting alone or for another party.


* Pirates Defeated in Bast
Pirates Defeated in Bast \n \nOfficial sources at Hart Station have confirmed that efforts to eliminate pirate vessels targeting medical supply ships in the region have been resoundingly successful. The Union of Bast Liberals, which placed bounties on the pirates, has stated that a total of 1,869 independent pilots helped to thin the bandits' numbers, thereby allowing the much-need Cerberus antidote to reach systems affected by the disease. Consequently, the Cerberus Plague has been eliminated from the following systems:

Cantjarisni

Rajukru

HIP 10175

Amahu

Leerham

BD-11 4280

Louguala

Altair

39 Tauri

Kamorin

Delta Phoenicis

Kappa Ophiuchi

Murung

LTT 14850

Gali

Cauani

LTT 6705\t

Watha

Asgaa

Svent

A spokesperson from the Union of Bast Liberals said: « There are times when the words 'thank you' just don't seem adequate. These pilots have saved literally thousands of lives, so, on behalf of all those they have helped, we want to offer our sincerest gratitude. »


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

Here are 10 of the 3,788 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Shenich Legal Solutions

Nijuna Company

Heheng Freedom Party

Labour of HR 244

LHS 221 Vision Systems

Koskit Company

Gongalungul Comms Organisation

5 G. Capricorni for Equality

Ditian Imperial Society

Official V640 Cassiopeia Front

When in boom, the wealth of the system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 54 minor factions experiencing an economic bust:

Values Party of BD+26 2184

New HIP 18187 Flag

Law Party of YZ Ceti

Tialocan Jet Raiders

Justice Party of AZ Cancri

Sosoling Purple Netcoms Network

HIP 19758 Empire Consulate

NLTT 12619 Confederacy

Forculus Ltd

Values Party of Jitani

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Two Dead in Tragic Accident
Two Dead in Tragic Accident \n \nTwo people died in a crash when a personal transport collided with a Lakon Type-9 Heavy transport vessel. The small ship, a type used to run between orbital facilities, was destroyed in the impact. The small vessel was ferrying two transport safety officials to the Laphria Shipyard in the Artemis system. They were on a knowledge sharing mission.

The Transport Safety Authority issued the following statement from their headquarters on Mars:

« This type of accident is always a terrible tragedy for those involved and the Laphrian authorities have promised full disclosure and co-operation with our investigation. »

They also reported that the pilot of the Type-9 was being treated for shock. She saw the transport break open only metres from her large window as she approached the station.

Elaine Boyd from the Federal Times asked for the identities of the dead and was told that they wouldn't be disclosed until the next of kin had been identified. She pressed further asking if one of the dead men was Arnold Lowe, a senior investigator in the Starship One disappearance. She was told 'no comment' and no further questions were taken.


* What Sort of Man Can Kill an Emperor?
What Sort of Man Can Kill an Emperor? \n \nThe Imperial Herald today released an article about the man allegedly responsible for the regicide of Emperor Hengist Duval.

The article detailed Brendan Paul Darius' upbringing in Eotienses, the home system for the bulk of Patreus' activities. His parents were a relatively wealthy client family under Senator Patreus known for their observation of traditional values. They worked on one of his many estates in the system. After completing his formal education in history and ethics he served as an officer on one of the Senator's Majestic class Interdictors, eventually rising to the rank of captain.

Following two decades of distinguished military service he joined one of Senator Patreus' liaison teams responsible for maintaining relationships with colony governors, planetary leaders and starport officials throughout the Senator's region of controlled space. His dedication and talents saw him rise above his parents' station to become patron.

The story tells of a man dedicated to service and traditional imperial values. A man who eschewed personal comforts and focused on his work. In the end the puzzle remains \u2013 why would such a loyal man kill his Emperor?


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

Here are 10 of the 386 minor factions in lockdown:

Simyr Party

Official Lusonda Front

Regulatory State of HIP 32812

Holiacan Dynamic Company

HIP 98621 Empire Party

United 54 G. Antlia Autocracy

Family of Aleuta

HIP 112829 Dynasty

NLTT 13249 Limited

Misisture Electronics Group

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 684 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Green Party of Cybele

Revolutionary Lie Yu Kou Coalition

Ida Dhor Citizens' Forum

Dominion of LP 417-213

Kaukhe Systems

LTT 47 Empire League

Revolutionary Party of Crevit

Cartel of HIP 80266

Justice Party of HIP 105391

Akandinigua Confederation

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Apalar System Calls for Aid
Apalar System Calls for Aid \n \nThe government of the Apalar system has issued an unusual request, inviting independent pilots to help them elevate their system's economy. According to Omar Jordan, governor of Svavarsson Terminal, the system is strategically positioned between the territories of several major powers, and is therefore ideally placed to provide these powers with services. The governor said:

« Our system is bordered by the territories of Archon Delaine, Zachary Hudson, Zemina Torval and Denton Patrius. Surely these individuals can understand the benefit of having an independent high tech system on their doorstep? »

Governor Jordan did not directly address the threat posed by Archon Delaine's forces, which are closer to the Apalar system than those of any other power, but it seems safe to assume that one of the factors behind the appeal is a desire to counter this danger. After all, if Apalar could enhance its economy, it could convince one of the other powers to bring it under their control, thereby reducing the chances of a takeover from Delaine.

Apalar Labour is offering rewards to independent pilots who assist with this effort by delivering industrial materials to Svavarsson Terminal in the Apalar system.


* Pegasi Pirate War
Pegasi Pirate War \n \nLast month, Archon Delaine's aggressive advance toward Imperial territory was halted. Defensive lines along the Imperial border held strong as the expeditionary forces of Operation Davy Jones were joined by detachments of the Imperial Fleet. Many in the Empire are now referring to the escalating conflict as the 'Pegasi Pirate War'.

Tens of thousands of ships throughout the Pegasi Sector have been impounded or destroyed in an attempt to weed the pirates out of hundreds of systems. Vastly outnumbered, Archon's forces have employed asymmetric tactics, effectively denying the possibility of decisive battles. Sieges of certain systems, such as Ngam, have been repeatedly broken by the Empire and re-laid by the Kumo Crew. Tacticians on either side have yet to produce an advantage in this war of attrition.

One thing remains clear through the fog of war: the struggle to liberate or dominate the Pegasi Sector is far from over.

* GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots
GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots \n \nThis weekly report typically covers some of the minor factions experiencing significant health issues, such as famine and outbreaks. At the time of writing, however, outbreaks have not been reported among any minor factions. This is likely to be because of the many independent pilots who helped combat the Cerberus Plague \u2013 specifically those who eliminated pirates in the Bast system, thereby allowing supplies of the Cerberus antidote to reach systems affected by the disease.


* GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming
GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming \n \nIn the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT), the GalNet monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled.

Any pilots who operate for one of the powers must deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time to ensure their activities are registered.


* Rescued from the Kumo Crew
Rescued from the Kumo Crew \n \nReports are coming in from the Pegasi sector of scores of marked slaves being rescued by Imperial Commanders participating in the 'United Offensive'. Acting in concert with members of the Sirius Corporation, Imperial Commanders are carefully extracting human cargo from Kumo Crew vessels. The cargo is then delivered to Sirius Corp Commanders, who fly them to safety for relocation. Unconfirmed rumours indicate that members of the Utopians are also joining the rescue and relocation efforts.

Spokesmen for the Kumo Crew have vehemently denied that marked slaves are anything but common criminals and degenerates, but one prominent case has received coverage on media circuits. Known only by her first name (for her own protection), former slave Aasha has become the face of the United Offensive.

\Imagine my surprise when I woke up from stasis in Comanga surrounded by pirates!\ Aasha originally entered a two-year Imperial slavery contract as part of the Quivira settlement with Silver Universal PLC. \I thought it was the right thing to do\ said Aasha. \I was a trained mechanical engineer and could fetch a shorter term than any anyone else in my family. The priates said that's what made me so valuable.\

Imperial Slavers Associated reiterated its previously stated opposition to transporting slaves outside the Empire. They added that any Imperial slave rescued from the Kumo Crew, or any violation of their terms of service agreement, would result in that slave's contract being rendered null and void.

\I don't know the Commander who saved me\ a tearful Aasha explained, \but I am so thankful to them, and the friendly folks at Sirius who helped me get to the relocation authority on Munshin.\

* Torval Offers Support to Patreus
Torval Offers Support to Patreus \n \nSome of the more sordid elements of Imperial media have continued their campaign against Senator Patreus about his connection with Emperor Hengist Duval's killer.

Over the past week Senator Patreus and his followers staying on Capitol have endured abuse from their accusers whenever they appear in public. This escalated into violence today as the Senator visited the Hall of Martyrs for his own viewing of the Emperor's body. When he arrived a mob formed and tried to prevent him entering the vestibule and reacted angrily when Patreus' own guards attempted to force a passage. Imperial Naval infantry on the scene separated the parties and allowed Senator Patreus to enter the Hall.

After the incident Senator Zemina Torval was the first to condemn the behaviour in a statement to guests and press at an event with Mastopolos Mining:

« This kind of insolent behaviour does not reflect well upon these groups or our beloved Empire itself. In this time of mourning we should all be mindful of our actions. The Emperor has been dead for only a few days and these rebels descend into near-barbarism. They should be cast out of the Empire. »

When asked about the accusations she scornfully replied:

« Denton represents what is strong within the Empire. His loyalty to the Emperor is unquestioned and anyone suggesting otherwise is a fool. »

* Imperial Inquisition and Emperor's Grace to Hold Meeting
Imperial Inquisition and Emperor's Grace to Hold Meeting \n \nMavia Kain, the High Inquisitor and leader of the Imperial Inquisition, is scheduled to pay a visit to Admiral Varrwen Mako Brennus, leader of Emperor`s Grace. The meeting will be held in the Emperor's Grace stronghold of Rishair at Lindblad Port. Both leaders will discuss a number of Imperial issues, including the assassination of Emperor Duval and the present military operations in the Pegasi sector.

Rumours about the groups' cooperation have been circulating since the start of the united Imperial offensive in the Pegasi sector. Both factions are presently engaged in a peacekeeping operation against the Kumo Crew, which began when Archon Delaine illegally invaded Imperial space and took Imperial citizens into slavery. Emperor`s Grace and Imperial Inquisition pilots are fighting together against this notorious crime lord, as both groups see him as a threat to galactic peace.

Sources close to Admiral Brennus revealed that the factions share the same traditional Imperial values. A senior official noted that: \We both care about the Empire, the Imperial way of life, and Imperial citizens. We are natural allies. The Empire is going through tough times - we need to support each other.\

* Aliens Kidnapped the President
Aliens Kidnapped the President \n \nThe spectre of President Halsey's disappearance in Starship One refuses to die down. Despite the findings of the official report some claim that the matter is far from closed. One such person is self-proclaimed conspiracy expert Ricardo Bentonio on his investigative show 'The Hidden World':

« They took her for their own purposes. Not the lizard people from Andromeda, that's the Imperial Dynasty. She's been taken somewhere different. »

Federal Navy officials refused to comment on this allegation. One Congressman was overheard joking « Does anyone listen to that loon's shows? Except his precious lizard people from Andromeda, of course! »


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report

* Aisling Duval Reviews her Security
Aisling Duval Reviews her Security \n \nThe personal security for Princess Aisling Duval is under review as yet another private conversation has been leaked to the press. Considering the content of the leaked recording some commentators have suggested that the princess would be better served by being more circumspect in what she says.

Much of the audio is undistinguishable but at one stage Aisling can be heard saying:

« Denton would never do something like this. He's far too up tight and strait-laced. Besides, he's a nobody now. That Lavigny bitch \u2013 she'll get the sympathy vote from this and she knows it. »

A spokeswoman for Princess Duval stated:

« This is clearly a fake intended to discredit the princess. To think that someone would stoop to this type of low politics in our time of grief is repulsive. »

Assassin's Family Brutally Murdered \n \nThe immediate family of Brendan Paul Darius \u2013 including his mother, father, sister and six year old niece \u2013 have been found murdered at their home on Eotienses. Inspector Reeve commented to local press that these were the most horrific deaths he had encountered in his many years of service.

After the murderer of Emperor Hengist Duval was revealed to be Imperial citizen Brendan Paul Darius, a light protection duty was placed with his family in case of reprisals, although locals were sympathetic to the family's dishonour rather than blaming them.

Inspector Reeve didn't comment on how the killers were able to subdue the guards, even though no fatalities in the team have been reported. The Inspector promised swift justice for the murders and called on anyone with any information to contact their local security office.


* Pirate POWs Pack Prisons
Pirate POWs Pack Prisons \n \nThe Pegasi Pirate War stemming from the United Imperial Offensive has taxed the logistical prowess of the Empire. Supplies, ships, and personnel must be transported up to hundreds of light years from their source to the Pegasi Sector. Provisioning the Imperial fleet over such distances is a monumental task in itself, but the steady stream of prisoners of war extradited to Imperial space must also be provisioned, guarded, and accommodated. Many prisoners await judgement by the Pilot's Federation for their crimes, while others face judgement in Imperial courts.

With many thousands of prisoners now in custody, accommodation is becoming an issue. Prisoners are currently held in hundreds of locations, creating additional logistical problems. Sources within Empire have indicated that a search for a suitable penal station, capable of holding all the prisoners, has begun.

* Economy of Apalar Improves
Economy of Apalar Improves \n \nOfficials at Svavarsson Terminal in the Apalar system have announced that they have received the necessary quantities of industrial materials to elevate their system's economy. The request issued by the government of Apalar was met with resounding enthusiasm, as independent pilots from across the galaxy helped to give the system the boost it needed.

Rewards for those who delivered industrial materials to Apalar are still pending, but Apalar Labour will make an announcement when these rewards become available.


* Further Disturbances in Mourners' Line
Further Disturbances in Mourners' Line \n \nImperial Naval infantry have once again intervened as protesters \u2013 who have taken issue with Senator Denton Patreus's connection to Brendan Paul Darius, the Emperor's murderer \u2013 attempted to prevent access to some of Senator Patreus's allies late last night. This time the agitators resisted the soldiers' efforts to maintain peace. After several attempts to peacefully resolve the situation, a riot squad was deployed to restore order.

The action was efficiently completed, but smaller disturbances and protests flared up throughout the night. All were pacified by the troops but many mourners were forced to flee. Calm was eventually restored and an Imperial Guard company has now been stationed to secure the entrance to the Hall of Martyrs. A full regiment of Naval infantry has also been moved into the city.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

Here are 10 of the 3,685 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

HIP 106213 Independents

Nan Sapwe Purple Energy PLC

Bangwa Independents

Hanneng Labour

Ekonir Nobles

Nu Jet Crew

BPM 28514 Purple Power and Co

Huokang Silver Universal Ind

Menambe State Organisation

Kruger 60 and Co

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 50 minor factions experiencing an economic bust:

Zandu Jet Syndicate

Democrats of LTT 4961

Chi Orionis Vision Organisation

Bodhengue Independents

Conservatives of Zandu

Defence Party of Arro Na

Social Tjakiri Progressive Party

Caeritis Front

United CD-58 538 Resistance

Borasetani Syndicate

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nIt's time for another weekly report on the struggles of the foremost political powers in the galaxy. Some have fallen from grace and others have climbed higher than anyone expected. Read on for the details.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval seems set to remain the most influential individual in today's political landscape. Immensely popular among members of the Pilots Federation, Arissa was able to secure seven more systems with ease while still contributing the bulk of the Imperial forces for the Pegasi Pirate War. While the size of her sphere of influence puts a heavy strain on the Princesses' organisation, so far her pilots have managed to compensate through widespread fortification.

Aisling Duval's administration faces another week of internal turmoil, which explains her drop to #4 in the GalNet rankings. While the 'Peoples' Princess' continues to enjoy the support of many Commanders, her short-term situation is difficult. Her sphere of influence has grown rapidly and now includes many systems that are draining her resources, leaving her space vulnerable to the increased enemy undermining seen during the past week.

Zachary Hudson has extended his influence to four new systems this week, showcasing the increased ability of the president's agents to project power across the galaxy. Hudson's ability to expand his reach might be compromised, however, by developments at home, where enemy wings continue to attempt to undermine his control. Although determined defensive efforts allowed Hudson's organisation to avoid falling into turmoil, it was a close call, sparking concerns for the future.

Felicia Winters' administration has recovered from the turmoil of last week thanks to well-coordinated fortification efforts and a minor decrease in enemy activity. While danger has not passed for the Shadow President's organisation, her supporters have again showed an ability to resist sustained hostile efforts to undermine her control, which have plagued Winters for the last two months.

Zemina Torval has seen her support base \u2013 which was previously dropping \u2013 stabilise and even slightly increase this week, as her supporters increase their efforts. Torval is still in an extremely difficult situation, however, as with almost a dozen of her systems undermined and both her organisation's efforts to claim new systems failing, she is facing turmoil in her space. As her enemies smell blood in the water, it's unclear if Torval's organisation will be able to recover from its current difficulties.

Denton Patreus has enjoyed a surge in support in recent weeks \u2013 a situation his Commanders used to expand his grasp, adding five new systems to his sphere of influence this week. This expansion came at the same time as a drop in fortification efforts at home, however, and focused counter-attacks from Kumo Crew pilots. With Patreus' administration barely escaping turmoil, it seems that the Senator's rapid expansion will be checked, for now, by problems at home.

Edmund Mahon has proven without doubt that his #2 ranking is well deserved. Despite being the focus of extremely heavy enemy action, with seven systems undermined and several others threatened, the Alliance politician's organisation avoided falling into turmoil with ease, even commanding a respectable reserve of resources to draw on. This is the result of both impressive fortification and a legacy of smart expansion choices, which is sure to make Mahon a formidable player on the galactic stage for the foreseeable future.

Li Yong-Rui claims the #3 position in the GalNet rankings \u2013 an impressive achievement for an organisation with fairly modest levels of Commander support. Sirius Gov continues to benefit from a strong strategic position, high-income systems and diplomatic efforts, which ensures the organisation does not see as much hostile activity as some of its neighbours.

Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew has resisted the Imperial offensive in the Pegasi Sector for the past six weeks, and there is no end to the fighting in sight. While Archon's control over most of his territory has been undermined, this has failed to push the pirate crew into turmoil, as his pilots focus their defence on a handful of key systems. What some envisioned as a quick knock-out blow has turned into a war of attrition, and as Torval, Patreus and Aisling face trouble at home, Arissa Lavigny-Duval's legions might have to shoulder the burden of the conflict mostly by themselves.

Pranav Antal has added five new systems to the Utopia, continuing the surprising surge in activity for this once-minor organisation. With the ambitious attempt to establish an Utopian commune in the distant colony of Takurua successful, it appears that Antal's rise to #8 might be sustained, or even improved, as long as Utopia continues to enjoy a period of relative peace.

* Imperial Citizenry Pays Tribute to Late Emperor
Imperial Citizenry Pays Tribute to Late Emperor \n \nFar from the Hall of Martyrs, Imperial citizens across the Empire have been paying tribute to the late Emperor. Many local system authorities have renamed landmarks and buildings in his honour, and a few have commissioned architects and artists to create new memorials in local capitals. The grandest of these designs has been commissioned by the Facece Empire Party on Topaz, featuring a modernist interpretation of the late Emperor sat atop a triumphal arch in the capital's main square. A statement released by the Facece Empire Party reads: \This minimalist sculpture will represent the spirit of the late Emperor, and all those who went before him, as a caretaker watching over the people\.

Pilots' bars have become more akin to literary salons of late, as commanders attempt to unravel the mystery behind Brendan Paul Darius' motives, and determine the existence of a possible mastermind behind the shocking assassination.

Perhaps the greatest tributes have come from the ordinary Imperial citizenry. In the days since the Emperor's death, the Office of Imperial Statistics has reported a 16% upsurge in newborn males being named \Hengist\ reflecting the populace's great affection for their late head of state.

* Florence Lavigny Calls for Calm
Florence Lavigny Calls for Calm \n \nIn her first public appearance since the death of her fianc\u00e9 Emperor Hengist Duval on their wedding day, Florence Lavigny made a short statement in the Imperial Palace press hall and answered a few questions. Her comments come amongst rising tensions on Capitol.

« We must remember proper decorum in this sad time. Our beloved Emperor would not want his death to be used as an excuse for some of the unpleasantness seen in our city. We should mark his passing with proper quiet reflection and respect for our fellow citizens. »

Although clearly devastated by the loss of her long-time friend, she maintained an air of regal dignity, providing a glimpse of what she might have been as Empress Regent. As well as calling for calm, she recalled earlier times with the Emperor in his youth, even some events while her first husband Prince Aristide Lavigny was still alive. These anecdotes forced smiles from even the most sombre reporters gathered there.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
GalNet Weekly Security Digest \n \nIn this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

Here are 10 of the 415 minor factions in lockdown:

Siki Jet Creative Ltd

Robor Crimson Travel Inc

Aowica Empire Party

HIP 112829 Silver Organisation

Turir Creative Incorporated

Movement for 34 Pegasi Values Party

Jet Energy Co

Hranit Democrats

Calhuacan Empire Party

Revolutionary Party of Ewah

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 670 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Jala Jet Camorra

Andracanike Purple Federal Inc

Union of Gliese 868 Green Party

Kamito Patron's Principles

LTT 5053 Crimson Clan

15 Delphini Purple Raiders

Wirnako Limited

Kauruku Empire League

Mbukuravi Jet Brothers

HIP 35246 United Interstellar

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* A Brief Look Back
A Brief Look Back \n \nIn this series, we look at some of history's less well-known figures, and examine the part they have played in shaping the galaxy. This week, we revisit a group of individuals whose exploits were covered by a number of media outlets last year.

Commander Angel Rose

Angel Rose's career belies her relatively mundane origins, which saw her grow up on a starport under the watchful eye of her mother, Maugvahnna Rose. Angel's rebellious streak was evident from an early age, however, and in a calculated attempt to exasperate her mother, she left home at the earliest opportunity to become a trader.

Unfortunately for Angel, things did not pan out exactly as she had hoped, and through a sequence of unfortunate events, the aspiring merchant found herself drawn into a life of crime, ultimately becoming a reluctant (and not entirely successful) assassin. This in turn led to her entanglement with a group of pirates, resulting in the events that so entertained the viewers of the Underground Channel last year.

Maugvahnna Rose

Most of those who know Maugvahnna Rose would describe her as a ruthless social climber, and in most cases they would mean it as a compliment. The daughter of a seamstress and a corporate pen-pusher, Maugvahnna was never going to be content to follow in her parent's footsteps, and at 23 she married the most powerful man that her limited social network gave her access to. Four years later she gave birth to her only child, Angel, although it fair to say that Maugvahnna was never burdened with an overabundance of maternal spirit. She went on to carve out a career as a starport captain, and played only a small part in the misfortunes that drove her daughter to a life of criminality. At least, that's how Maugvahnna tells it.

Pirate Dread Katherine

With her thick mass of shoulder-length dreadlocks and studded gun-metal jewellery, few would mistake 'Dread' Katherine for anything other than what she is \u2013 a pirate. Born into a wealthy agricultural family, Katherine was kidnapped by pirates when she was just 19, and found herself an unwilling spectator to a campaign of murderous plundering \u2013 an experience that gave rise to a profound hatred of any form of machismo, and indeed of men in general. But Katherine's proximity to the pirate life also bred a certain appetite for its dangers and freedoms, and it wasn't long before she became a pirate in her own right. Today, Pirate Dread Katherine is one of the most feared buccaneers in her region of space.


* Federation Continues Debate on War
Federation Continues Debate on War \n \nDissent is growing within Federation congress over the situation in the Pegasi sector. Though many view the Pegasi Pirate War as a chance to let the Empire waste their resources, a growing contingent is becoming frustrated with the Federation's lack of response.

\Tolerating such rampant lawlessness in our sphere of influence makes us look increasingly feckless. If we don't react with a show of force, it's an open invitation for every would-be warlord to subjugate Federation space », Congressman McRand argued in congress today.

« Involving ourselves in the same war as the Empire is just asking for a security and diplomatic nightmare. Frankly, I trust these Empire pilots little more than I so Archon Delaine », responded Congresswoman Faye.

Debate continues in congress over taking a more active stance in the war. At last count, over 140 Federation systems and 89 billion citizens were under the control of the Kumo Crew.

GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots \n \nThis weekly report typically covers some of the minor factions experiencing significant health issues, such as famine and outbreaks. At the time of writing, however, outbreaks have not been reported among any minor factions.


* Children of Liberty Offer Prescription for Empire's Future
Children of Liberty Offer Prescription for Empire's Future \n \nThe group known as 'Children of Liberty' released another public statement today, this time addressing what it sees as the \crossroads\ the Empire finds itself at in the wake of Emperor Hengist Duval's assassination.

\Everyone can see that the Empire is at a crossroads, but it is not just a question of who will lead the Empire - it is a question of whether that leader will be answerable to the people. The Empire was founded on the principle of a representative democracy, one in which senators \u2013 duly elected by the people \u2013 carry out the peoples' will. Marlin Duval would be ashamed of how her noble vision has been twisted and corrupted by her brother and his progeny.\

The statement went on to lament that none of the current claimants seem qualified to \restore liberty and honour\ to the Empire, although the statement did say that \ironically enough, Aisling Duval embraces the most democratic methods, and goals, of all the claimants. Perhaps if she embraced the aim of returning the Empire to its democratic roots, the lovers of freedom in this galaxy would have someone they could actually support.\

* Commodities needed in the Kamcha, Dinkas and Jang Di Systems
Commodities needed in the Kamcha, Dinkas and Jang Di Systems \n \nA mysterious organisation called Emperor's Dawn has issued open contracts for a diverse selection of commodities: Ceremonial Heike Tea, Battle Weapons, and Toxic Waste. Each of these is to be delivered to a specific starport, as outlined below:

Battle Weapons should be taken to Saarinen Station in the Kamcha system

Ceremonial Heike Tea should be taken to Sikorsky Orbital in the Jang Di system

Toxic Waste should be taken to Blaauw Port in the Dinkas system

Little is known about Emperor's Dawn, but it seems that the curiously-named organisation, which is based in the Kamcha system, has access to considerable resources, as it is throwing a lot of money at this commercial endeavour. Pilots of a mercantile disposition would do well to consider participating in this effort, as there is certainly an opportunity for resourceful traders to make a tidy profit.


* Democracy Threatened in Old Worlds
Democracy Threatened in Old Worlds \n \nAllegations have surfaced from sources close to the office of Prime Minister Edmund Mahon that unnamed elements within the Pilots Federation are deliberately undermining democratic factions in the Old Worlds. These groups are allegedly scheming to push corporate governments into power to strengthen trade agreements with Alioth.

The Lave system appears to be the latest victim of these efforts. With support from independent pilots, the incorporated Lave Fortune Organization has become the most influential faction in the system. If they are successful, Lave will become the third system in the cluster \u2013 after Leesti and Reorte \u2013 to have its democratic government overthrown by a corporation.

The rise of the Alliance as a galactic power has brought prosperity to the Old Worlds, but commentators fear that its basic principles are being undercut by Edmund Mahon in order to protect trade interests. The Prime Minister's office has yet to respond to these allegations.

* Gun Battle Ends Darius Family Murder Investigation
Gun Battle Ends Darius Family Murder Investigation \n \nThe hunt for the killers of the Darius family came to a dramatic conclusion today in a firefight with local security forces on Eotienses.

The Darius family was brutally murdered four days ago in what is believed to be revenge for Brendan Paul Darius's assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval. All of the suspects \u2013 who are understood to have been local vigilantes seeking revenge for the Emperor's murder \u2013 were killed in the operation. In a statement, Inspector Reeve, who led the investigation, said:

« Considering the savagery with which the suspects butchered the Darius family, we couldn't take any chances while attempting to arrest them. They were heavily armed and opened fire as our officers entered the building. »

He refused to answer questions about why the family wasn't in protective custody, or how the protection team were able to be subdued so easily. One local witness of the operation claimed that no attempt was made to arrest the suspects, an accusation Inspector Reeve vigorously denied.

* President's Bodyguard Found Murdered
President's Bodyguard Found Murdered \n \nThe Federal Security Services today revealed that a member of the Presidential Protection Detail has been found dead in her home.

« Agent Susan Monroe was killed in the early hours of this morning and there is evidence that her residence had been searched. At this time we do not know why, or if anything was taken. Her death was caused by several stab wounds to the chest and neck. »

When asked whether there were any suspects in the case, the spokeswoman responded:

« We don't have a suspect at this stage and the investigation is progressing. We do want to speak with Elaine Boyd, who was romantically involved with Agent Monroe, and have identified her as a person of interest in the case. We urge her to contact us to help us with our investigation. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Elaine Boyd then they should inform us or their local law enforcement agency. »

Elaine Boyd is a reporter with the Federal Times, which refused to comment when asked about the reporter.


* Imperial Slave Association Audited
Imperial Slave Association Audited \n \nA surprise audit of the Imperial Slave Association was recently conducted by a special committee of the Imperial senate. The records and practices of the ISA were meticulously examined to ensure compliance with laws governing the treatment and transportation of Imperial slaves. The committee found numerous violations of transportation regulations in systems near Imperial borders, and numerous border-security officers and pilots were subsequently indicted for these violations.

No serious violations concerning the treatment of Imperial Slaves were uncovered, though many warnings were issued to those who were found holding slaves beyond their fixed term of service. Imperial slaves found in these circumstances were restored to full citizenship and reimbursed for the labour they performed beyond their established term.

The ISA issued a statement following the audit:

« We wish to reiterate that the sale of Imperial slaves to non-Imperials and to systems beyond Imperial space is strictly prohibited. Any who are found engaging in this illicit activity will be held accountable.\

* Claims of Federal Involvement
Claims of Federal Involvement \n \nWith the long history of conflict between the superpowers, it is not unexpected that some of the more paranoid members of the Imperial population have directed their suspicions concerning the Emperor's assassination at the Federation. While no-one in authority within the Empire takes these claims seriously, some of the citizens and lower members of Imperial society wonder that if the claims aren't true, then why don't those in charge simply say so?

Some believe that these unanswered, if unreasonable, questions lay at the heart of some of the trouble reported in the queue of mourners on Capitol.

To many of us, the thought that the Federation would risk all-out war by killing the leader of the only other superpower capable of battling them on equal terms is far out there. But it's not the craziest theory by a long mark.

Conspiracy theorist Ricardo Bentonio claims that the Emperor is not dead, instead it is just his human host that has been transformed and the being we knew as Emperor Hengist Duval has returned to his homeworld in the Andromeda galaxy.


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 2,447 minor factions at war:

United Ndandjimbo Progressive Party

League of Amemait

Chingaa Energy Solutions

5 Gamma Equulei Life Exchange

Jakuta Empire Assembly

HIP 104504 Imperial Society

Friends of Choerini

Chicchang Crimson Federal Dev

Anayali Crimson United Corp.

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

* 'Operation Uranus' Successful
'Operation Uranus' Successful \n \nThis week, Archon Delaine hit back at the renewed Imperial offensive. Using a multi-pronged attack, the Kumo Crew struck hard at systems under the influence of Senator Patreus. Dubbed 'Operation Uranus', the campaign successfully pushed the system of Contiku into turmoil.

The number of Kumo Crew raids within Imperial space increased during the week, with multiple Imperial commanders reporting run-ins with the cartel. Although a combined task force of Imperial powers laid siege to the Pegasi sector, pilots loyal to Senator Patreus failed to prevent the pirate counter-attack. This may jeopardize the fragile alliance between the powers, and strengthen internal opposition to the Pegasi Pirate War.

Time will tell if the operation has shifted the balance of the power, but Archon Delaine certainly refuses to go gently into the night.

* Federal Times Reporter Named as Murder Suspect
Federal Times Reporter Named as Murder Suspect \n \nFollowing news of the brutal murder of Agent Susan Monroe, the Federal Security Services upgraded Elaine Boyd's person of interest status to 'suspect', and called for any information regarding the reporter's movements.

« This was a particularly savage murder of a person who laid their life on the line. We believe that Elaine Boyd was using her lover to access confidential information. While we haven't yet ascertained the exact nature of the information she was trying to access or why she murdered the agent. It is also unknown whether Agent Monroe was a willing participant in the information retrieval, although we believe that her murder indicates that she was not.

« We urge anybody who sees Elaine Boyd to report her location immediately. At this time she is considered dangerous and should not be approached. »

In a statement, the Chief Editor of the Federal Times said:

« Having worked with Miss Boyd for seven years, I find it hard to imagine that she could commit the crime she is accused of. We are of course helping the security services with their inquiries, but I can confirm we have had no contact with Miss Boyd for several days. »


* Emperor's Killer Not Working Alone?
Emperor's Killer Not Working Alone? \n \nWhile Chancellor Anders Blaine has provided almost daily updates on the investigation of Emperor Hengist Duval's assassination there has been little progress of note until today. The breakthrough is reported to have originated from an investigation into the killing of Brendan Paul Darius' family.

The local investigator, Inspector Reeve, discovered encrypted data files hidden within the toys of the six year old girl killed in the attack. These files have revealed the existence of a secret group \u2013 calling themselves Emperor's Dawn. They are an ultra-traditionalist movement fearing the erosion of imperial values.

The exact reason why the Emperor was targeted is as yet unknown, but it was discovered that Princess Aisling has also been targeted by the group. In response to this threat her security has been increased.

Chancellor Blaine concluded his update by saying:

« This unexpected development has revealed a hideous cancer within our society. One that will be hunted down and eradicated with the utmost urgency. »


* Federal and Imperial Diplomats Discuss the Pegasi Sector

In a meeting between Federation and Imperial commanders, Commander Nyluss of the Merchant Marines offered these words: \We must re-establish liberty in those zones that have become lawless. The Kumo Crew and its vagabond leader will no longer be tolerated in our space. I call upon all Federation pilots. How can you tolerate this encroachment upon our worlds? »

Commander Corrigendum of Lavigny's Legion added: « We welcome all those who want to oppose the tyranny of Archon Delaine, and ask that Federation and Imperial commanders operating in the Pegasi sector give one another a wide berth as they work toward the common goal of bringing Delaine to justice.\

Report Raises Concerns about Operation Davy Jones \n \nThe Stratis Information Group, an independent think-tank of political, defence, and economics analysts, has published an in-depth study of Operation Davy Jones, the ongoing conflict between the Imperial Navy and the forces of Archon Delaine.

Aside from providing statistics regarding the current Imperial deployment, the report raises concerns about the overall purpose of the operation, stating that: « The current premise of ridding the Pegasi sector of the Kumo Crew is merely a cover for aggressive Imperial expansion into Federation-aligned systems. »

Stratis analyst Marcus Orrin elaborated on the concerns: « The Imperial Navy has invested a tremendous amount of effort and resources in securing the Pegasi sector. To believe they will simply withdraw from the region once hostilities come to an end is to ignore historical precedents. The Empire will likely maintain an occupation force in the Pegasi sector for some time after. »

The former reporter of the Federal Times was accused of murdering her partner, Agent Susan Monroe. An investigation into her death is already underway and agents from the Federal Security Service have been granted special access to assist the independent local police.

The police have so far refused to provide any details, but an off-the-record source has revealed that a suicide note was found. It allegedly states that she could no longer live with the guilt of killing her lover.

The Federal Times has so far refused to comment on the fate of their reporter.

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Heike Starport Security under Strain
Heike Starport Security under Strain \n \nOn patrol outside the busy starport of Brunel Station, Heike Security Forces pilot Kenji Nobu reluctantly admits that not all visitors to the station are being subjected to \the full scrutiny of the law\.

\There's just too many of them and too few of us\ Nobu said, resignedly. In the last 24 hours, nearly 750 ships have docked at Brunel Station, mostly small or medium transport ships \u2013 over 10 times normal volumes.

\Word is that the brass is waiting on approval for emergency funds. The pilots' union rep said we might have to put in some overtime. Nothing I haven't heard before, though\ said Nobu.

Dockworker Sothy Ferrell elaborated on what was drawing pilots to the station: \Some fruits, some coffee, but mostly tea. How 'bout those monks growing the stuff? No doubt they're loaded!\

It has been reported that a faction called Emperor's Dawn has recently issued a contract for large quantities of ceremonial Heike tea. The group is located over 200 light years from Heike, with most of the journey lying within Federation space.

\I might recognize a name or two coming up on the scanner », said Nobu, « but most of it just runs together. Listen, I gotta get back to my patrol. »

* Fuel Rats Complete 1,000th Rescue
Fuel Rats Complete 1,000th Rescue \n \nHeroes: that's what some call the Fuel Rats. Ever since launching their emergency fuel delivery service a little over two months ago, the Fuel Rats have made an impact on the lives of over 1,000 commanders who would otherwise have faced a long spacewalk home.

For one stranded commander, over 31,500 light years from inhabited space with five months' worth of exploration data on board, the Fuel Rats' service was greatly appreciated. Commander Paul Kavinsky, in partnership with Commander Rusticolus, made an incredible high-speed transition to the far side of the galaxy to rescue Commander TheHairyMob.

Commanders Anuranium and Domaq also demonstrated the lengths to which the Fuel Rats will go. High above the galactic plane, 2,800 light years north of Sagittarius A*, a commander found himself stranded with no hope of returning home under his own power. The limited number of nearby stars made locating the hapless commander exceptionally difficult, but the rats found their man.

A little closer to home, Commanders Aitken and Dardevel were not to be outdone. Commander Ghetto King was only moments away from drawing his last breath, with only two seconds of emergency air remaining, when the Fuel Rats swooped in to save the day.

This reporter joined the Fuel Rats to witness a rescue mission firsthand. I experienced a mix of adrenaline and warm satisfaction in knowing I had made a positive difference to another pilot's fate.

* Civil Aid Crisis as Millions of Mourners Fill Capitol
Civil Aid Crisis as Millions of Mourners Fill Capitol \n \nThe civic authorities on Capitol have reported needing to use strategic reserves of food, medical supplies and shelters as millions of mourners now fill the streets, waiting for their chance to see Emperor Hengist Duval's body before the funeral next week.

In all of history there has never been as many people on the home planet of the Empire as there are today. This strain has pushed all of the emergency services way beyond capacity, so extra troops have been drafted in for increased security and to assist with distributing the aid. Imperial Navy personnel are also providing medical and rescue services, with temporary command areas deployed throughout the city.

The problem is exacerbated by the mourners remaining in the city after paying their respects. People are being urged to leave the Capitol if they have already visited the Hall of Martyrs, but many are choosing to stay to witness the funeral.


* Athena System Hosts 'XYZ Fight Club'
Athena System Hosts 'XYZ Fight Club' \n \nThe popular gladiatorial tournament known as the 'XYZ Fight Club' took place again this weekend. Our reporters were ringside for the spectacle. Pilots descended on Athena, pitting dog-fighting skills against one another in both light and medium ships.

Criminals targeting participant Commander Angel Rose marred the start of the event and forced an evacuation of Darboux Orbital, but Commanders Rhea and Lynk1973 ensured that contingency arenas allowed combatants and spectators to avoid further harassment.

Commanders Bodmans, Danten and Old Sauveur dominated play for the light rounds \u2013 fast-paced jousting with no shortage of collisions. Commanders DJTruthsayer, Estelath, Ace Rimzy and Jankster gave solid performances, but were knocked out.

The light semi-finals saw Bodmans \u2013 recent champion of the Sol Grand Prix \u2013 facing off against Commander Rainy Day in close-quarters knife-fighting. Rainy Day spent chaff and shield-cells before Bodmans delivered the deathblow \u2013 a barrage of missile-fire \u2013 that delighted the audience.

Medium-class contents continued into the night, involving Couriers, Vipers, and Diamondback Scouts. Commander Synaptic made notable use of their DBS-stealth capabilities to evade missile-fire, but eventually succumbed to their opponent's attacks.

Angel Rose's Viper took on Commander Louise of Darkwater's Courier. Audiences watching the event live cheered the commander from Slough Orbital, but it was not enough to protect her from her opponent's rail-fire as a victorious Louise of Darkwater moved into the later rounds.

Showing impressive skill in the marathon tournament, the same pair of combatants managed to reach the finals for both classes. Bodmans and Old Sauveur intitially exchanged fire in Eagles, with Old Sauveur proving victorious in the fast-paced battle through a well-timed use of shield cells. Going head-to-head in Couriers to decide the victor of the medium heats, Bodmans eventually claimed victory at the end of a protracted defensive battle.

* Zemina Torval and Florence Lavigny Join Patreus' Campaign
Zemina Torval and Florence Lavigny Join Patreus' Campaign \n \nSenator Patreus has seen a resurgence of support since his declaration of war against the group responsible for Emperor Hengist Duval's murder. Reports from the campaign have indicated that Emperor's Dawn is now claiming responsibility for the regicide, although this hasn't been independently confirmed as yet.

In a Senate session, Senator Zemina Torval declared her support for the operation and instructed her loyal followers to join the campaign.

Analysts have been keenly watching the political landscape shift in the weeks since the Emperor's death. Many had written off Patreus as his influence waned with the dishonour of his association with the Emperor's assassin, Brendan Paul Darius. However, his decisive action against Emperor's Dawn has raised his profile. Some believe that it is a cynical ploy by Patreus, but none can argue that he has gained the support of the Senate heavyweights.

Even Florence Lavigny has spoken out for unity and support for Patreus:

« When I was much younger, and my first husband dear Aristide was sadly eaten by a Ling Lang in his own menagerie, there were conspiracy theories, none of which were true. The simple truth was he was foolish to keep so many dangerous animals as pets. I've known Denton for years, and I know he wasn't involved in the Emperor's murder. Hengist had many enemies, but Denton Patreus was not one of them. »

* Imperial Internal Security Service Requests Exploration Data
Imperial Internal Security Service Requests Exploration Data \n \nIn an unprecedented move, the Imperial Internal Security Service \u2013 the organisation responsible for domestic security throughout the Empire \u2013 has issued an open contract for exploration data. Agent Cope of the IISS made the following statement:

« The Imperial Internal Security Service is conducting a comprehensive revision of its information networks, and is therefore in need of as much fresh data as possible. The more information we have, the more accurate we can make our database. We thank the community in advance for their cooperation with this effort. »

The request was preceded by rumours that the organisation was actively gathering information about the group known as Emperor's Dawn. When asked about the rumours, Agent Cope said:

« I can assure you that any allegations concerning interest in specific individuals or groups are entirely groundless. The IISS has a remit to analyse any available data for useful intelligence, and the exploration data we have requested will be subjected to this analysis. That does not mean, however, that this operation has been designed to gather information about Emperor's Dawn. »

This refutation was somewhat undermined, however, by an article published this morning in the Imperial Citizen. In the article, the Citizen claimed to have intercepted an IISS communiqu\u00e9 in which Emperor's Dawn was specifically mentioned:

« Our recommendation concerning Emperor's Dawn is to gather fresh astrological data, and to filter it for information about the group's movements and bases of operation. Our belief is that the organisation has no more than half a dozen bases within inhabited space, but it would nevertheless be advisable to accumulate accurate data. »

The request is being managed by the Cemiess Empire Party on behalf of the IISS. Independent pilots interested in participating should deliver exploration data to Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system.


* Antares Incident Links to VP's Death?
Antares Incident Links to VP's Death? \n \nThe case of reporter Elaine Boyd took an unexpected turn today as several respected newsfeeds, including the Federal Times, received encrypted data packages. It is claimed that these were automatically sent by Elaine Boyd from a public storage server with instructions to be delivered if newsfeeds reported her death.

The data apparently reveals a connection between the death earlier in the year of Vice President Nigel Smeaton and the Antares Incident. His death was officially declared an accident, although many at the time suspected foul play. Those suspicions are likely to rise again with the revelation that he was related to one of the crew aboard the Highliner Antares when it disappeared on its maiden flight 50 years ago.

Elaine Boyd discovered details of a private 'off the books' investigation by the Vice President into the incident and that he suspected it was caused by sabotage, rather than drive component failure. He had already spoken to a number of now quite senior officers involved in the original enquiry. Elaine Boyd's information implied that he may have been killed to stop his investigation.

In a statement, the chief editor of the Federal Times said:

« We hope that amongst the information Elaine has provided there is evidence to prove her innocence in the crimes she was implicated in. We are continuing to examine the data in detail. »

* Agent Susan Monroe Part of VP's Protection Detail
Agent Susan Monroe Part of VP's Protection Detail \n \nThe Federal Times today revealed the latest article in their ongoing investigation into the apparent suicide of their reporter Elaine Boyd.

They revealed that Agent Susan Monroe, who Boyd was accused of murdering, was part of Vice President Nigel Smeaton's protection detail at the time of his death. It already seemed obvious to many that Agent Monroe was the source of the reporter's information, but now there is greater likelihood that she provided it willingly.

Officials from the Federal Security Service insist that Agent Monroe was an unwilling participant and they had evidence to link the agent's death to the reporter.

* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

Here are 10 of the 3,539 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Independent LP 30-55 Confederacy

Avalon Organisation

Liberty Party of Tz'utuls

Glusargiz Patron's Principles

Angurongo Patron's Principles

Mawu Corporation

Reddis Independents

LHS 3262 Blue Clan

Kruger 60 Free

Kuki An Ring

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

These minor factions are experiencing an economic bust:

Zandu Jet Syndicate

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Utopia: Commune or Cult?
Utopia: Commune or Cult? \n \nSimguru Pranav Antal's vision of Utopia has taken the galaxy by storm, with recent estimates suggesting that 91.8 billion have joined the movement, and shows no signs of slowing down. Many are attracted by the commune's experimental tech and high standards of living, as well as the ideal of a better society.

But is everything as it seems? A few former utopians, who asked to remain anonymous, have come forward with disturbing testimonies. One young man said: \My sister and I lived on a Federation fringe world. Life's hard on the frontier, and we travelled to Utopia to find work. Everything was great at first \u2013 we had employment, free accommodation \u2013 but then my sister got a position assisting the local overseer. She found out they were kidnapping people and locking them up for questioning or disagreeing with Antal's wisdom. It's run like a cult. I told her not to confront them... Now I don't know where my sister is, or if I'll ever see her again.\

When one of Antal's senior aides was confronted with these accusations, they appeared shocked: \Simguru Antal would never condone such practices. These are false accusations, intended to discredit Utopia, from those who have not reached enlightenment. Visitors are welcome to view our sim-archives at any time, and experience what life as a pilgrim is truly like.\

* Core Dynamics has Links to VP's Death?
Core Dynamics has Links to VP's Death? \n \nIn another shocking revelation the Federal Times today posted a story highlighting possible links between a non-exec member of the board of Core Dynamics and Vice President Nigel Smeaton's death. They first referenced an interview on January 28th with Congressman George Fallside who appeared to have early knowledge of the Vice President's death.  The Congressman refused to comment on the article, but it is public knowledge of his non-executive directorship of Core Dynamics and several other major arms manufacturers.

More damning was the evidence concerning one of the crew of the Starship One, Flight Engineer Nick Baron, who had previously worked at Core Dynamics before joining the President's Crew. From the information package sent by Elaine Boyd after her death, the Federal Times published extracts of financial records of the flight engineer.

When tracing these records through a convoluted series of transfers, one of these transfers was through a shell corporation , in which  Congressman Fallside was involved. The trail of the payments revealed that Boyd must have obtained a high level clearance access, possibly provided by Agent Monroe.

When asked about today's story, the Chief Editor for the Federal Times commented:

« There does appear to have been a conspiracy on several levels. We believe that the destruction of the Highliner Antares so many years ago may not have been an accident. When the Vice President was investigating the death of his relative, he must have discovered some of these details, and possible the dark forces killed him, and when our reporter Elaine Boyd did the same, she too was silenced. We are still not clear how it relates to the present day. Our reporters continue to investigate.

« At the Federal Times we always seek the truth and we will discover the truth here. »

* Core Dynamics Issues Statement Regarding Recent Controversy
Core Dynamics Issues Statement Regarding Recent Controversy \n \nYesterday's revelations from the Federal Times concerning an alleged connection between a high ranking member of the Core Dynamics board and the Highliner Antares incident have finally prompted an official response from the ship manufacturer.

« Core Dynamics takes the safety of space flight very seriously and would never deliberately act to jeopardise our own or any other corporations' development. It is hard to accept that anyone from our company would act in such a manner. Given the gravity of the accusations the accused non-executive board member has agreed to step aside while we investigate. We have requested that the Federal Times share their information with us so that a full investigation into the matter can be carried out. »

Congressman George Fallside is the only named person in the article. When asked about the Congressman's connection with the company and his apparent knowledge of the Vice President's death before it had been announced the spokesman responded:

« Any impropriety by any member of the board will be fully investigated. I cannot comment on Vice President Nigel Smeaton's death. My understanding it that has already been investigated by the relevant authorities. »

The Chief Editor for the Federal Times confirmed that they would share the information they had with the Sirius Corporation, Core Dynamics and appropriate law enforcement agencies.


* Public Viewing of Emperor Hengist Duval Ceases
Public Viewing of Emperor Hengist Duval Ceases \n \nToday was the last day for the millions of mourners to pay their respects to the Emperor in the Hall of Martyrs. In the past month an estimated seven million mourners arrived on Capitol and have waited in line to enter the vestibule where the Emperor's body has lain.

Of those millions fewer than half were able to actually see the Emperor despite the dedicated efforts of the Imperial Palace curators. Holographic shrines were placed along the queue of the people waiting, although some of the crowd complained that this broke tradition.

The queue reached such a size that the military had to be called in to maintain order from flashes of violence flaring up. Although apart from a few cases the offences were quite minor as befitting the sombre mood. Food, shelter and medical care also needed to be provided and many of the waiting people praised the efforts of the naval infantry.

For the rest of the day the troops will be busy again, this time clearing the route already filled with the waiting citizens in preparation for tomorrow's funeral.


* Emperor Hengist Duval's Funeral
Emperor Hengist Duval's Funeral \n \nThe funeral of Emperor Hengist Duval, the 15th Emperor in the Duval line, took place today amidst a crowd of millions on Capitol in the Achenar system.

Mourners from all over the Empire lined the streets of Capitol. All over the city, the streets were filled to bursting and in a sombre reflection of the wedding a month ago, the white dress uniforms of the Imperial Naval Infantry lined the streets.

In a last minute change to tradition, the funeral procession followed a longer route through the city so that as many of the assembled mourners as possible could witness the passing of their Emperor. The procession marched at a sedate pace and was led by selected members of the Imperial Guard carrying the Emperor.

In another break from tradition and despite her age, Florence Lavigny walked directly behind the coffin even though the marriage ceremony hadn't been completed. This has raised eyebrows among some of the more conservative members of Imperial society.

Behind the lonely widow marched the immediate family and then the members of the Senate. Behind the most powerful senators came certain patrons, the most well-considered of their station with a direct connection to the Emperor. Next were the clients and citizens and, representing the full range of the Imperial population, these were followed by some of the Emperor's favourite slaves \u2013 which by tradition were set free after the ceremony.

The procession stretched for almost 18 kilometres and took seven hours to complete its tour of the city. Soldiers along the route provided welcome refreshment for both the procession and the crowd. When the procession returned to the Hall of Martyrs, the senators followed inside for the private internment ceremony. Across the Empire, in households and public places, the Feast of Remembering began.

A sombre hush settled across the city for most of the day, but now that the Emperor has been laid to rest, the question everyone wants to know the answer to is \u2013 who will be the next Emperor?


* Utopia: More Than a Cult?
Utopia: More Than a Cult? \n \nSpokespeople for Utopia have responded to recent accusations that dissidents in systems under their control are being roughly treated.

\I've been saddened by recent publications that describe the Utopia movement as a cult or oppressive theocracy,\ Utopia futurologist Dr Saeed McNamara said. \All societies have disruptive elements who threaten the stability of the whole, but I like to think we take a more humane approach to dealing with them than others.

« Rather than enslaving or oppressing disruptive elements, or shipping them off to penal colonies to break rocks for the rest of their lives, we introduce our problem citizens to revolutionary simulation technology designed to increase their empathy for their fellow men and women. Criminals and dissidents aren't evil \u2013 they've just become disconnected from society. We've proved time and again that seeing the world through the eyes of others, through technology, can be a healing experience.\

Dr McNamara declined to elaborate further on the nature of Utopia's corrective sims, or to address rumours that those subjected to these treatments manifest radically altered personalities.

* The Hutton Mug
The Hutton Mug \n \nThe words « I made it to Hutton Orbital » carry a certain amount of weight among pilots. As seasoned navigators know, the starport lies approximately 0.22 light years from the nearest star \u2013 a significant stretch by anyone's standards \u2013 and it is not unusual for novice pilots, having failed to check the distance from Alpha Centauri to Hutton Orbital, to run out of fuel long before they reach the station.

Completing 'The Hutton Run', as the journey is sometimes called, is therefore a badge of honour among pilots, an achievement that distinguishes the amateur from the professional.

Now, a company called BlipMagnet has decided to capitalise on this phenomenon with the Hutton mug, a commemorative beaker bearing the legend (you guessed it) 'I made it to Hutton Orbital'. The novelty item is available only at the starport, and the company no doubt hopes it will appeal to those who want to commemorate their epic journey.

BlipMagnet claims (presumably only half seriously) that the mug is made from « the salvaged frame shift drive plates of ships that ran out of fuel before reaching the station ». In fact, the company has issued an appeal for scrap materials with which to produce their next batch, and is offering anyone who delivers such materials their very own Hutton mug. Whether this will motivate those not normally inclined to undertake such punishing expeditions, or result in an epidemic of stranded pilots throughout the Alpha Centauri system, remains to be seen.

Memorial in the Heavens \n \nCommander Sataris, a member of the East India Company, was recently honoured by an anonymous benefactor. To commemorate his mother's recent passing, the rights to register a planet in her name were purchased from Universal Cartography.

« Commander Sataris has served with distinction, valour and honour in all his duties, regardless of the circumstances. In honour of his late mother, rights have been purchased to rechristen a world in the BD+26 2184 system as 'Kathy McBrayer'. Any mother capable of rearing a son like Sataris is well deserving of such a memorial. Kathy is an example to us all. »

Commander Sataris responded by saying: \I invite all members of the Pilots Federation to visit the memorial planet Kathy McBrayer in BD+26 2184. »

* Chancellor Blaine Opens Senate Debate
Chancellor Blaine Opens Senate Debate \n \nWith the sombre echo of Emperor Hengist Duval still resonating throughout Capitol, the Senate reopened today to deliberate how the question of succession will be resolved. Chancellor Anders Blaine opened the discussion:

« Without a clear line of succession, we have a solemn duty to decide who will rule the Empire  in these fractious times. It is clear that our beloved Emperor wished for Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval to become heir and so, when the time came, become Emperor. That time has now come, but the law does not allow us to honour his wishes. Instead, we must follow the rules set out for us by centuries of law and tradition.

« The Senate has one month to determine who will be the 16th ruler to sit on the Imperial throne. The candidate must be of royal blood or of royal marriage, and must have a clear majority backing of the Senate in the final count. The final tally will be taken on October the 5th.

« Personally, I would urge the senators present to consider the Emperor's intentions carefully. I knew him well, and I know that everything he did was for the good of the Empire. »

The city has almost recovered from the massive influx of mourners, and the streets are once again clear of the press of humanity. Now the question on everyone's lips is: who will be the next to occupy the Great Throne?


* Core Dynamics Unveils New Gunship
Core Dynamics Unveils New Gunship \n \nCore Dynamics has a long-running association with the Federation, having produced everything from the humble Eagle to the mighty Farragut Battle Cruiser for the Federal Navy. Their latest offering, the Federal Gunship, is a sturdy combat vessel designed to provide the Federation with a superior fighter escort.

The natural comparison point for the new Gunship is the Federal Dropship, which offers a similar balance of features, but with a total of seven external hardpoints \u2013 two small, four medium and one large \u2013 and advanced armour and shields, the Gunship boasts a stronger combat profile than the Dropship, as well as offering better internal hardpoint quality.

This combat superiority comes at a cost, however, as the ship has an inferior flight model to that of the Federal Dropship, with a top speed of 170 and a boost speed of 280. It is fair to say, however, that speed and manoeuvrability were probably not chief among the Federation's concerns when the ship was designed. This is a vessel that has been created to dominate other ships, rather than outpace or outmanoeuvre them.

The Federal Gunship is expected to retail at 45,814,000 CR, and will be available to all pilots holding the rank of Ensign or above in the Federal Navy Auxiliary.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit (*).

Here are 10 of the 3,373 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

LTT 15278 Gang

Umbrigua Blue Pirates

New Kuki An Labour

Aeduwona Holdings

LHS 2260 Brotherhood

Lan Tzak Purple Dragons

Viracocha Partners

CD-54 471 Exchange

Arugh Organisation

G 139-3 and Co

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

* Imperial Veteran Sceptical about Patreus's Campaign
Imperial Veteran Sceptical about Patreus's Campaign \n \nImperial senator Denton Patreus has taken a strong stance on Emperor's Dawn, condemning the organisation and vowing to eradicate it from the galaxy, but responses to his statements have so far been mixed. Some have speculated that he is simply trying to curry public favour, while others have suggested he is attempting to draw attention away from his connection to Brendan Paul Darius, the emperor's assassin.

Now, the senator's assertions have been questioned by a source from within the Empire itself - General Anthony Corvus of the Imperial Navy. In a statement given to the Imperial Herald, the general said:

« We are clearly dealing with a well-organised and highly motivated cell organisation, and despite Denton Patreus's optimism, in my opinion it is too early to make any predictions about its suppression. I have dealt with similar organisations in the past, and they can be surprisingly hard to extinguish. No sooner have you dealt with one cell, another appears somewhere else. »

Senator Patreus was approached for a response to the general's words, but declined to comment.


* The Truth about Emperor's Dawn
The Truth about Emperor's Dawn \n \nAs the campaign against Emperor's Dawn escalates, captured materials have revealed more about the group and its aims to destabilise imperial society.

Reporters from a number of respected imperial newsfeeds, including the Imperial Herald, were invited to inspect some of the seized information. At first the reporters were surprised by how innocuous the material appeared. Taken at face value, it seemed to espouse beliefs and traditions supported by many throughout the Empire, despite the rather extreme tone. The propaganda became more sinister, however, when it elaborated on how these beliefs would ideally be enforced. Some of the items included speeches denouncing the Emperor and his 'complicity in the erosion of tradition'. Elsewhere, demands were made to remove the Emperor so that someone more fitting could take his place. So far, nothing has been revealed about who the group considers a proper candidate for Emperor.


* New Combat Fighter from Gutamaya Shipyards
New Combat Fighter from Gutamaya Shipyards  \n \nOne of the defining characteristics of the Eagle Mk II is its peerless manoeuvrability, so when it was announced that the successor to the popular fighter would be less manoeuvrable than the ship it was replacing, eyebrows were raised. It seems, however, that there was little cause for concern, as while the new Eagle doesn't quite rival its predecessor in terms of agility, it outclasses it in virtually all other respects.

Not only is the new Eagle faster than its predecessor, with a top speed of 300 and a boost speed of 400, it is also has a superior combat profile, boasting advanced armour and shields, and with the small hardpoint of the Mk II replaced with a medium hardpoint. These new features are supported by an improved power plant, although these enhancements do of course mean extra weight, resulting in a base jump range of 10 LY.

The other major change introduced with the new Eagle is that it has been manufactured by Gutamaya Shipyards rather than Core Dynamics, who produced the Eagle Mk II. The result, as one might expect, is a sleeker, more elegant vessel, albeit one that has retained the menacing profile of the earlier model. Additionally, the vessel has been produced specifically for the Imperial Navy, meaning that pilots will need to hold a rank of Outsider or above in the Imperial Navy to fly it.

The Imperial Eagle is expected to retail at 110,825 CR.

* Emperor's Dawn Issues Request for Supplies
Emperor's Dawn Issues Request for Supplies \n \nAs news spreads that Senator Denton Patreus has launched a military operation against Emperor's Dawn, journalists at The Imperial Citizen report that the insurgent group has issued a public appeal for commodities. Significantly, the goods the group has requested \u2013 progenitor cells and narcotics \u2013 are illegal in many jurisdictions.

Emperor's Dawn has not explained its need for these commodities, but given its militant stance it can be safely assumed that the goods will used in its ongoing campaign against the Empire. The organisation is understood to have set up delivery points at starports in the Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems.

The Empire has not issued a response to the appeal, but it is likely that it will implore the public to ignore the request. But with so many independent traders in the galaxy, many of whom have no particular loyalty to the Empire, it seems inevitable that at least some will answer the call of Emperor's Dawn.


* Emperor's Dawn Bases Discovered
Emperor's Dawn Bases Discovered \n \nAccording to the office of Senator Denton Patreus, Imperial intelligence has discovered several bases belonging to Emperor's Dawn. Senator Patreus, who is leading the campaign against Emperor's Dawn, has issued a statement confirming that he is initiating a combat operation designed to destroy the insurrectionists. The senator made the following announcement to the press:

 « We are not dealing merely with treasonous sentiments here \u2013 we are dealing with a violent organisation that has shown itself willing and able to commit truly heinous acts. They have already taken the life of our beloved Emperor - where might their misguided rage fall next? We must act swiftly and decisively if we are to eliminate this threat to the Empire. »

Imperial forces have been mobilised for the operation, but independent pilots are also being called on to lend their aid. Senator Patreus is offering generous rewards to those who contribute to the campaign.


* Kumo Crew to Target Lavigny-Duval
Kumo Crew to Target Lavigny-Duval \n \nSystems under the sway of Arissa Lavigny-Duval have begun expressing discontent at the current political situation in the Empire, and the Kumo Crew is taking the opportunity to cause trouble of their own.

Leaked military intelligence indicates that hundreds of Kumo Crew fleets will soon descend on Imperial territory in an effort to cultivate further civil unrest. The plan is apparently to force Duval into admitting the foolishness of the Pegasi War by bringing it as close to home as possible.

Operation Uranus saw the Kumo Crew pirates target worlds under the influence of Senator Denton Patreus, but this is the first time they have been bold enough to strike farther afield. Only time will tell what impact this will have on the Imperial power players.

* The People's Princess Speaks
The People's Princess Speaks \n \nAt a public charity event in which several dozen slaves were granted their freedom, Princess Aisling Duval took the opportunity to speak about the succession.

« It seems peculiar that as the closest living relative of our beloved Emperor, I am not involved in the process of selecting his successor. It is even stranger that there is a process at all - after all, I am the natural heir. »

Her attempt to gloss over the legality of her claim has sparked angry rebuttals from legal experts and the camps of the other likely candidates. When we spoke to people on the street, however, we encountered almost universal support for the Princess. One Capitol resident told us:

« I'm all for tradition, but we have to move with the times. Princess Aisling Duval understands what we need to do, and has the youthful vigour to make that happen. »


* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nAisling Duval has once again topped the powerplay rankings, as extraordinarily low opposition to the people's princess, combined with sufficient fortification, has allowed her to excel above all others this week.

Zachary Hudson has demonstrated an ability to stand firm against overwhelming opposition. Undermining in over thirty systems was cancelled and extended the protection of the Federation fleet to several more, and Hudson's rise to second place is well warranted this week.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's rising administrative costs, accompanied by shrewd undermining, has led to turmoil in seven systems this week. An increased emphasis on meaningful fortification is clearly needed to maintain the senator's sway over her vast territory.

Edmund Mahon has again guided the Alliance into prosperity. Careful fortification has secured Alliance borders, although the Alliance saw more opposition than the Empire. Prime Minister Mahon is now poised to offer citizenship to several key systems in the coming week.

Felicia Winters, much like Hudson, weathered above-average undermining, but in spite of this she proved her resilience by providing humanitarian aid to one star cluster while maintaining a comfortable command capital reserve.

Denton Patreus, ever the smooth operator, balanced his budgets nearly perfectly this week. Evading a deficit, his fleets now occupy control spheres in two additional locations.

Li Yong-Rui has led Sirius Gov back into the black. Shrewd leadership, cutbacks, and the diligent labours of Sirius representatives have yielded a large command capital reserve. With an optimistic outlook, SiriusGov is poised to extend its influence once more in its corner of space.

Zemina Torval has made a recovery from recent weeks of turmoil and the reduction of her portfolio. The senator now looks to end a long period of contraction in her enterprises through the acquisition of key systems.

Archon Delaine's lean forces have again amassed enough command capital to stir up insurrections in several systems. Although the Kumo Crew was rebuffed in its attempts to overthrow Federation and Imperial systems, a surge in criminal activity was reported in several more systems.

Pranav Antal's quiet commune succeeded in sharing the vision of Utopia with the inhabitants of Miki and the surrounding systems, and his people now hope to bring these systems into the fold. With no systems undermined this week, Pranav's people are clearly the embodiment of Utopia.

V775 Herculi Boys

Ho Hsien Values Party

Ho Hsien Legal Group

Mariyacoch for Equality

Holiacan Dynamic Company

Autocracy of Furuhjelm III-674

Furuhjelm III-674 Republic Party

Pfembali Raiders

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 2,562 minor factions at war:

Anum Empire Assembly

Revolutionary Party of Pepper

Yurundhi Co-op

Kitae Nationals

Tavgi Blue Life Inc

LTT 9795 Boys

Mongatha Domain

Dukes of Maray

Hand Gang of HIP 32435

Gaohikel for Equality

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

* Research into Strange Objects Begins
Research into Strange Objects Begins \n \nA Federal research programme has been established to study the strange objects discovered in a number of systems, including Tanmark and HIP 102128, it was announced today. The project is being led by Professor Ishmael Palin, formerly of the Homeland Scientific Council.

The first of the objects was discovered some months ago, with further objects being found in the weeks that followed. Those who have seen the artefacts first-hand report that they are reminiscent of biological forms, consisting of a spherical bulb-like element connected to a number of cylindrical capsules. Some have even suggested they might be life forms in their own right.

Aside from their unusual structure, the objects \u2013 referred to by some as 'unknown artefacts' and dubbed 'anomalous extraterrestrial objects' (or 'AEOs') by Professor Palin and his team \u2013 are believed to have the capacity to damage nearby machinery, although exactly how this occurs is not fully understood. This has made transport of the objects problematic, as they can inflict significant damage on a ship's cargo hold, and on adjacent ship's systems.

Naturally, speculation concerning the objects has been rife, and there appears to be significant evidence that they are of non-human origin. Professor Palin refused to be drawn on the subject, however, saying:

« A discovery of this kind represents an event of major scientific interest, and I am delighted to have been asked to lead this research project. It would be imprudent of me to speculate on the objects' origin or purpose. Suffice it to say that my team and I will be subjecting the artefacts to rigorous examination over the coming weeks, and I very much look forward to sharing our discoveries with the scientific community. »


* Imperial Slave Regulations Proposed
Imperial Slave Regulations Proposed \n \nFollowing the recent audit of the Imperial Slave Association, the Imperial Senate Audit Committee has recommended the introduction of further regulations governing the treatment and transportation of Imperial slaves.

The proposed regulations centre on improved vetting of commanders permitted to transport Imperial slaves, and include the suggestion that pilots must hold the rank of 'Master' in the Imperial Navy as a minimum requirement. It is also suggested that resources be set aside for the recovery of Imperial slaves transported and sold outside the Imperium.

Svetlana Zhukov, chairwoman of the ISA, voiced her support for the regulations:

« It is our duty to ensure that Imperial citizens serving terms as slaves remain within the borders of the Empire until they are returned to full citizenship. Our hope is that these new regulations will ensure the rights of Imperial Slaves are not trampled on by those unscrupulous enough to sell people for quick credits.\

Political commentators have expressed doubt that the proposed regulations will be approved, but many remain hopeful.

The information stored on the device was encrypted but with the assistance of technicians at the Federal Times they were able to extract some of the information.

The spokesman stated that the data would not be made public at this time, but some of the information might enable the authorities to locate the wreckage of the Highliner Antares. The data has been handed over to the Sirius Corporation as well as investigating officers.

Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval Calls Impromptu Press Conference \n \nAfter the day's Senate deliberations finished, Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval stopped to answer questions from the assembled reporters. When asked what she considered the most important issue facing the Empire, she replied:

« Most of all the Empire needs stability and continuity. I was privileged to spend some time with Emperor Hengist Duval after he recovered from his coma. He shared with me a vision in which the Empire continues to build on its strengths of justice and tradition.

« It saddens me greatly that anyone, especially someone considering themselves an imperial citizen, could bring an end to such a great man. I consider it my duty to make sure that his vision becomes a reality. »

When asked if that meant she considered herself the heir to the Emperor's throne, she stated:

« The decision of who will become Emperor is in the hands of the Senate. There are many suitable candidates, and I am honoured to be among them. Whether or not I am crowned, I will continue to work toward the future that Hengist Duval shared with me. »

Movement for Shoujeman Free

Orang Universal Organisation

Gui Xian Patron's Principles

LFT 78 Patron's Principles

LHS 3749 Group

Nagi Empire Pact

Armodiang Patrons of Law

* Munshin Announces Plan to Aid Refugees
Munshin Announces Plan to Aid Refugees \n \nOfficials at Ocrinox's Orbiter held a press conference earlier today to announce their intention to build a state-of-the-art resettlement facility for refugees of the Pegasi Pirate War.

\We recognize the plight of their friends in the Pegasi Sector, and extend our welcome to all those who wish to settle here. We encourage all those who have access to transport to come to Ocrinox's Orbiter. You were promised citizenship \u2013 citizenship you shall have. You were promised protection \u2013 protection you shall have. You left home to seek a new life \u2013 a new life you shall have.\

The plan leans heavily on three aspects of the Munshin system: distance from the war, readily available food and jobs, and the necessary infrastructure to support a large population surge.

Reports also indicate that officials at Ocrinox's Orbiter have sent messages to the Pilots Federation and Princess Aisling Duval asking for urgent delivery of medical supplies.

* Kumo Operation to Hit Aisling Duval
Kumo Operation to Hit Aisling Duval \n \nEver the opportunists, Kumo Crew commanders have swept across a number of systems controlled by Arissa Lavigny-Duval in the last seven days. They penetrated deeper than in any previous skirmish, and elevated the level of danger faced by Imperial citizens as a result of the Pegasi Pirate War.

With turmoil affecting billions of Imperial citizens and sweeping them into the ongoing saga, Commanders and tacticians have begun to realise that the conflict has taken on a new dimension. Leaked intelligence indicates that as the week draws to a close, Archon will focus his attention on planets and stations pledged to Aisling Duval.

With Kumo Crew attacks imminent, the Empire must decide how to best fortify its strongholds against further incursion while trying to stem their enemy's momentum. What was once thought of as a simple operation now draws on the strength and resources of a thousand worlds.

* Frontline Report: The War against Emperor's Dawn
Frontline Report: The War against Emperor's Dawn \n \nFour days ago, Imperial senator Denton Patreus launched a military campaign against Emperor's Dawn, the organisation responsible for the murder of Emperor Hengist Duval. Since then, there has been intense conflict in the Dakshmandi and Maausk systems, where two Emperor's Dawn bases are located, with scores of Imperial Navy vessels and Emperor's Dawn ships exchanging fire.

Journalist Katherine Ryder, who has reported from war zones across the galaxy in a career spanning more than twenty years, recently met with one of the Imperial generals leading the campaign. In a report for the Imperial Herald, she described the unfolding conflict between the Empire and Emperor's Dawn:

« Against the crisp darkness of space drifts a Majestic-Class Interdictor, its elegant lines belying the deadly power of its artillery. A few hours ago, the ship was deep within the Dakshmandi system, overseeing the deployment of Imperial squadrons tasked with rooting out and destroying Emperor's Dawn vessels. For the people of the Dakshmandi and Maausk systems, the arrival of the Imperial fleets has proved divisive: some see the Empire as a saviour, while others fear that the conflict it has incited will do only harm. »

« On the bridge of this stately vessel I meet General Anthony Corvus, the military veteran who recently voiced scepticism about Denton Patreus's campaign. He describes the insurgents as disciplined and methodical, capable of delivering systematic, targeted strikes. With what sounds almost like admiration, he refers to their steely resolve, telling me that no matter how many Emperor's Dawn ships his pilots destroy, the rebels' morale never appears to waver. He also mentions the many hundreds of independent pilots who have boosted the insurrectionists' numbers. Evidently, he says, the Empire's enemies see this conflict as an opportunity to deal a blow to the superpower. »

« The general's remarks highlight a facet of the campaign underscored by Denton Patreus's critics \u2013 namely that the senator has underestimated Emperor's Dawn, assuming that the mere sight of an Imperial battle fleet would demoralise the insurgents. In reality, Patreus has found himself drawn into a protracted battle against a disciplined and apparently imperturbable enemy. No one questions the Empire's ability to bring significant firepower to the conflict, but even the Empire's resources are not inexhaustible. If it does not gain an advantage soon, it may have to consider temporarily withdrawing from the conflict, and devising a different strategy. »

* Imperial Internal Security Service Issues another Appeal
Imperial Internal Security Service Issues another Appeal \n \nIn a repeat of the events of last month, the Imperial Internal Security Service \u2013 the organisation responsible for domestic security throughout the Empire \u2013 has issued a second public appeal for exploration data. This time, however, the IISS is being explicitly clear about the reasons for the request. In a statement to the media, Agent Cope of the IISS said:

« It is clear to us that the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn represents a significant threat to the Empire, and it is therefore essential that its ability to inflict harm on Imperial assets and citizens be neutralised as quickly as possible. To this end, the IISS has authorised the Cemiess Empire Party to reimburse any pilots providing reliable exploration data. This data will be used to locate bases belonging to Emperor's Dawn. »

Independent pilots interested in participating in this effort should deliver exploration data to Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system.


* Did Aisling Duval Know About Emperor's Dawn?
Did Aisling Duval Know About Emperor's Dawn? \n \nIn a devastating expos\u00e9 released earlier today, the Imperial Herald has published details of alleged links between the secretive group backing Princess Aisling Duval and some of the funding sources for the Emperor's Dawn insurgency. While a direct connection between Princess Aisling and the insurgency is not alleged, there does appear to be a connection to senior members of the Princess's inner council.

Most notable of these is the patron and industrialist Damon Clarke. The Herald has found evidence that D and C Shipping, Inc., one of Clarke's companies, apparently funded and organised weapon shipments to people now known to be members of Emperor's Dawn three years ago.

It is not known at this time whether there has been any recent contact between Clarke's company and these individuals, or how this relates to the assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval. Patron Damon Clarke was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman for the company said:

« We are an interstellar shipping company, making thousands of shipments for clients each day. We are approved to transport weapons where such shipments are legal, and we occasionally do so. We do not comment on individual transactions. If a former client later became a terrorist, that is certainly abhorrent, but it is hardly the fault of D and C Shipping, Inc. »


* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nEdmund Mahon has led the Alliance to prosperity this week, surpassing all other major powers. New interstellar agreements have extended the Alliance's areas of governance, while diligent legislative reports allowed the Prime Minister to effectively withstand attempts to undermine his authority. The Alliance now looks forward to a period of unprecedented prosperity.

Zachary Hudson's fleets weathered a massive storm this week, while successfully beating back the highest levels opposition the Federation's President has seen. As defensive fleets executed their orders with diligence, offensive task forces pressed on the pain points of the Federation's rivals. Hudson has made it clear that challenges to his authority will not be tolerated.

Felicia Winters has consistently proven her ability to defy the odds, and this week was no exception. Withstanding the established norm of heavy opposition, the Shadow President's couriers busied themselves with the distribution of aid packages throughout her sphere of influence. Her people now stand ready to extend Federation aid to additional systems.

Aisling Duval's publicity machine suffered minor setbacks late this week, resulting in a drop in standing. Sources close to the 'People's Princess' have pledged to organise media blitzes in thousands of systems. It remains to be seen whether the lost standing will be recovered, although her supporters are, as always, optimistic.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's hard stance against crime was rejected by seven control systems this week, representing roughly 10% of systems previously governed by the senator. Five additional control systems are petitioning for an end to Senator Lavigny-Duval's administration. The loss of these systems may prove to be a double-edged sword, however, as their maintenance has historically required a disproportionate amount of administrative effort.

Lee Yong-Rui's Sirius Corp spent its assets with prudence this week, making deals in several systems. Negotiations are still pending, but the prospect of further acquisitions has noticeably driven up the company's stocks in financial markets, and shrewd investors would do well to take heed.

Denton Patreus perfectly balanced yet another weekly budget, leaving him with insufficient capital to expand or prepare any systems this week. Having experienced relatively low opposition in his own territory, Patreus focused his efforts on destroying Emperor's Dawn. With analysts predicting that the conflict will last at least another week, the absence of distractions such as subjugating additional systems may allow the senator to effectively stamp out the traitorous elements within his territory.

Zemina Torval's enterprises have shown promising signs of economic recovery. The shrewd businesswoman has expanded her control in Imperial space for the first time in weeks. Careful planning has ensured that Senator Torval now rests on a comfortable cushion of command capital, and wise preparation and expansion may allow her to rise further in standing.

Pranav Antal has built up his standing this week through his characteristic peaceful approach, standing in stark contrast to his neighbour in the Pegasi Sector. Utopia and the Simguru rejoiced this week as the Miki system joined the commune. Utopia's holdings now match those of Senator Torval.

Archon Delaine's excursions into Imperial territory contributed to the turmoil now faced by Arissa Lavigny-Duval and Aisling Duval. The successes of the expeditionary fleets came at the cost of expanding his dominion. Ever the opportunist, Archon Delaine now stands poised to overthrow neglected Federation systems bordering the Pegasi Sector.

Hutton Mug Appeal Successful \n \nA few weeks ago, the novelties manufacturer BlipMagnet announced the release of the Hutton Mug \u2013 a commemorative beaker sporting the words « I made it to Hutton Orbital ». The item was designed to appeal to those completing the epic journey to Hutton Orbital, which lies approximately 0.22 light years from the nearest star. The concept proved highly appealing, and thousands of independent pilots made the trek to Hutton Orbital to deliver scrap materials for BlipMagnet's first batch. Following the success of this event, the director of BlipMagnet, Chase Fulbright, released a statement:

Local Faction Helps Ready Munshin \n \nThe task of resettling Pegasi Sector refugees is underway at Ocrinox's Orbiter in the Munshin system. Hundreds of independent pilots have already helped to deliver vital medicines to Ocrinox's Orbiter.

Leading the effort is a previously unheard-of local faction called the Libertas Cooperative. Made up of freed Imperial Slaves and their descendants, the group states that it is dedicated to helping the Empire's least-fortunate. Members of the cooperative are manning docking bays and working overtime to unload cargo ships, and several independent commanders are working in concert with the group to increase the flow of medicines into the system.

The government of Munshin praised the quick action and dedication of the Libertas Cooperative, while a spokesman for the cooperative invited Pegasi Sector refugees to seek employment with the Libertas Cooperative.

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

* Federal Research Programme Terminated
Federal Research Programme Terminated \n \nReports have begun circulating that the Federal research programme established last week to study the so-called 'anomalous extraterrestrial objects' (or AEOs) has been terminated. This news comes only a week after the inauguration of the project.

According to a source at Fort Harrison, where the programme was based, study of the objects was brought to an abrupt halt by the station governor, Aoishe Quaid. Apparently, Quaid ordered the head of the project, Professor Ishmael Palin, to immediately cease his research. The reason for Quaid's decision is not known, although it is not believed to have been informed by concerns over public safety.

A second source from Fort Harrison, who asked not to be named, had the following to say:

« Frankly, I don't think it was Quaid's decision at all \u2013 I think she was pressured into shutting the programme down. She was enthusiastic about the project and had a lot of respect for Professor Palin, so this change of direction just doesn't make sense. The question is, who forced her to cancel the research, and why? »

The objects under study were described as quasi-organic in nature and capable of broadcasting location data across vast distances. Their discovery was widely considered the scientific find of the decade, and the cancellation of the project will no doubt provoke a strong response from the scientific community.

Professor Palin declined to comment on the Governor Quaid's decision.


* Senator Patreus Calls for Senate Investigation
Senator Patreus Calls for Senate Investigation \n \nAs Senator Denton Patreus prepared to enter the Senate to continue the deliberations over the succession, he issued an angry demand for a full senate investigation into the reported links between Emperor's Dawn and Princess Aisling Duval's office.

« While I sympathise with the princesses' situation, having experienced a similar shock, I cannot allow that sympathy to influence my judgement. When a member of my household committed the most heinous of deeds, I submitted myself to the security services and gave them every access they needed.

 « We cannot wait to act, and I call upon the senate to commence an immediate and full investigation into any links between Princess Aisling and Emperor's Dawn. »

After the initial flurry of information from the Imperial Herald, no new facts were released today. Patron Damon Clarke remains at large, and the considered opinion is that he has fled the Empire.


* Chancellor Blaine Confirms Senate Investigation
Chancellor Blaine Confirms Senate Investigation \n \nAt the start of the day's deliberations, Chancellor Anders Blaine declared that a Senate investigation into the claimed connection between Princess Aisling Duval's office and the insurgent group Emperor's Dawn was to be undertaken. The investigation will begin immediately, despite the Senate being in closed session until the succession is decided.

In response, Aisling Duval stated that she would comply in any way she could with the investigation. She also said that her own security teams had discovered some alarming information that she would share with the investigation committee.

Meanwhile, the hunt for Patron Damon Clarke continues. Several of his associates were arrested by the Internal Security Service in the early hours of the morning and subjected to questioning.

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

* Shelter from the Storm
Shelter from the Storm \n \nYesterday, Utopia added its support to the Mushin government's call for help as the Pegasi Pirate War continues to displace millions of citizens.

The head of the Utopian relief effort, Adjudicator Adric Claavis, released the following statement:

\The people of Utopia cannot stand idle while others suffer such misery. We will do everything in our power to assist in this relief effort, bringing hope to those who have lost so much in this bitter conflict. »

« Utopian ambassadors have asked the Kumo Crew for passage through their space to allow access to Mushin. In addition to delivering humanitarian supplies, Utopia will welcome any refugees who wish to begin new lives, away from the fighting, on our worlds.\

* Aisling Duval Praises the Munshin System
Aisling Duval Praises the Munshin System \n \nPrincess Aisling Duval has issued a statement praising the efforts of relief workers in the Munshin system.

\War is a plague on our galactic society, and like all disease it most affects the poor, the hungry, and the downtrodden. It is therefore with great pride that I look to the Munshin system. There one sees true examples of Imperial citizenship, and true heroes. Any person can fire a laser, but only a true Imperial can see the humanity in another person. I extend my gratitude to the people of the Munshin system, and to the Libertas Cooperative, who are working so hard for the victims of the Pegasi Pirate War. The tireless commanders ferrying medicines to Ocrinox's Orbiter are likewise to be commended.\

The princesses' critics immediately accused her of overlooking the pilots fighting in the Pegasi Pirate War, saying: \Every day, brave men and women of the Imperial Navy are killed in this war. Where is Princess Aisling's support for their families?\

* A Galactic Treasure Hunt
A Galactic Treasure Hunt \n \nAlfred Jeffress, the reclusive philanthropist, has released an intriguing statement. In a press release, the eccentric billionaire announced his intention to initiate a galaxy-wide treasure hunt \u2013 and to give a share of his vast fortune to the winner. This is the first public statement from Jeffress in several years, as the humanitarian \u2013 who made his fortune trading rare and exotic goods \u2013 has spent much of the past decade on an extended galactic tour.

According to the press release, Jeffress has « hidden » a mystery object somewhere in space. The first person to find this object and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. The press release also contains a riddle that Jeffress claims will lead participants to the mystery object:

« A vision of the Devil and Orion's hounds will start you on your path. »

The announcement has prompted a flurry of speculation and excitement, and hundreds of pilots have already taken to their ships to search for the mystery object.


* Pirates Target Pegasi Refugees
Pirates Target Pegasi Refugees \n \nReports are pouring in from the Amitrite system of pirate attacks on refugees fleeing the Pegasi Pirate War. The transports pouring from the Pegasi sector are often overloaded and poorly equipped, making them easy prey for the pirates. Additionally, many of the families fleeing the region bring only their most prized possessions with them, making them particularly attractive to the miscreants who lurk in Amitrite's many asteroid belts.

Representatives of the Defence Force of Amitrite have warned that their forces are stretched too thin for them to respond to every distress call, and they are urging refugees to avoid the system entirely. Those who feel they have no option but to enter the system have been encouraged to fly in convoys for mutual protection. The DFA added that any efforts to eliminate the pirates in Amitrite would be welcomed.

* Pirates Continue to Target Refugees
Pirates Continue to Target Refugees \n \nReports continue to pour in from the Amitrite system of pirates targeting refugees fleeing the war-torn Pegasi sector. The refugee transports have been stopping in Amitrite to refuel while travelling to a resettlement centre in the Munshin system, leaving them open to attack.

In an effort to protect the refugees, the Imperial Navy and the Defence Force of Amitrite have issued bounties on the pirates, hoping this will encourage independent pilots to help to alleviate the problem. For those with combat experience, there is money to be made in Amitrite.


* Sothis Crystalline Gold
Sothis Crystalline Gold \n \nScientists based at Newholm Station in the Sothis system have made a startling announcement \u2013 the discovery of an entirely new metalloid. The material, called Sothis Crystalline Gold, is produced by exposing ordinary gold to the thermal vents that line the seabed of the planets Sothis A5 and Sothis A6 \u2013 or, more specifically, to the submarine gas emitted by these vents. Exactly how the gas transforms the gold is not yet fully understood, but the scientists claim that the resultant metal is completely unique.

Given the emergent nature of the discovery, the scientists of Newholm Station have yet to find any applications for Sothis Crystalline Gold, but they are optimistic about finding constructive uses for the material. They are also offering entrepreneurial pilots and explorers an opportunity to earn a quantity of the rare material by delivering gold to Newholm Station in the Sothis System, thereby allowing the scientists to produce more Sothis crystalline gold and conduct further tests.


* Senator Patreus offers Support to Senator Lavigny-Duval
Senator Patreus offers Support to Senator Lavigny-Duval \n \nAlthough the Senate remains in closed session until the succession is determined, Senator Denton Patreus made his support clear in a speech to his command staff:

« Everyone knows that my priority is the security of the Empire. It is my duty as a senator to provide the best possible opportunities for the clients, patrons, citizens and slaves who follow me. I take that duty seriously, as I do my oath as a senator to care for the Empire as a whole.

« Part of that duty is to ensure that whoever sits at the apex of Imperial society is the right person for the task at hand. They must know when change is needed, yet still observe the traditions that make the Empire strong. They must be strong to ensure that we cannot be defeated, but they must also show mercy when the situation requires it.

« Many of my loyal followers have said that I would be a suitable candidate for Emperor, and I am flattered and deeply honoured that they hold me in such high regard. To them I say that I will be happy to work with whoever is declared Emperor. Were it up to me, then the choice would be simple.

« My vote goes to one whom, but for the cruellest of murders, would already occupy the throne. It goes to my esteemed fellow senator, Arissa Lavigny-Duval. »

Some commentators have stated that this public demonstration of support is at odds with the principle of a closed Senate session, but others counter by saying that the current situation is unparalleled in Imperial history.

* Palin Invited to Join Research Group
Palin Invited to Join Research Group \n \nLast week saw reports that Professor Ishmael Palin has been forced to cease his research into the so-called anomalous extraterrestrial objects, also known as 'unknown artefacts'. The Voice of Varati has since received a statement from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, an independent scientific body:

\We were extremely distressed to read reports that Professor Palin has seen his attempt to research the unknown artefacts forcibly terminated. This is indeed a sad end to a promising beginning, especially given the insights concerning the artefacts the professor had shared with us all.

\We can only speculate as to why he's been silenced in this way, but the fires of suspicion are spreading rapidly. Someone in a position of power knows far more about these things than the rest of us, but wishes this information to remain secret. The question is \u2013 why?

\The Canonn is going to redouble its efforts to conduct open research into the UAs, as we feel it is in the interests of humanity to learn as much about these mysterious artefacts as we can. We also urge Professor Palin to join us, as we feel it would be in his and his team's best interests. The professor can contact our council at any time, and we will assemble a quick-response team to assure his safety.\

* Plastic Fantastic
Plastic Fantastic \n \nHaving been banned from cockpits for over a year, the craze of the Bobblehead is set to return. Although seemingly innocuous, these little plastic figures have been implicated in thousands of accidents across known space, and have even been used by pirates and assassins to murder unwary pilots. But after intense lobbying from various pilot groups and toy manufacturers, production has begun on a new generation of Bobbleheads, which will soon grace cockpits.

Security services have released safety advice to commanders regarding these cockpit adornments, reminding pilots to check their Bobblehead for explosives, hidden cameras and illicit drugs, and to ensure the Bobblehead is firmly affixed to the dashboard before undertaking any manoeuvres.

* Shadow President Winters Calls for Investigation
Shadow President Winters Calls for Investigation \n \nIn a speech before Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters called for an open and thorough investigation into the allegations made in recent articles posted by the Federal Times:

 \There is too much evidence here to be ignored. I knew Vice President Nigel Smeaton personally and he was a good friend - the thought that he was murdered for investigating the death of a family member is repugnant. Our society is one based on truth and freedom and I call upon President Hudson to immediately instigate an impartial and open investigation into these allegations.\

Her speech was met with support from both sides of the political divide. There has been no response from the President's office as yet.


* Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval Gains More Powerful Support
Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval Gains More Powerful Support \n \nCapitol has been abuzz with rumour following Senator Denton Patreus' open declaration of support for Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval. While possibly not a frontrunner for Emperor, Patreus commands a sizeable fleet and is rich and influential enough to help Arissa Lavigny-Duval become Empress.

Senator Lavigny-Duval already enjoys the support of Chancellor Anders Blaine, whose voice is perhaps the loudest and most influential in the Senate.

The Imperial Herald's revelations concerning connections between Princess Aisling's office and the Emperor's Dawn insurgency have severely impacted her rating, and are likely to have cost her support in the Senate. The political landscape has been shaken further by Senator Zemina Torval's announcement that she is backing Arissa Lavigny-Duval to be crowned Empress.

* Pirates Wiped Out in Amitrite
Pirates Wiped Out in Amitrite \n \nOfficials from the Defence Force of Amitrite have praised the many pilots who helped clear the system of pirates this week. Hundreds of hostile ships were eliminated, and crime levels in the system subsequently dropped to new lows.

Representatives of the Libertas Cooperative, speaking on behalf of resettled Pegasi Sector refugees, also extended their thanks to the pilots: \Many of the refugees in the Munshin system have been separated from their families. Now they can be safe in the knowledge that their loved ones can traverse the Empire safely. For the second time in recent weeks, the citizens of the Empire have proved they care about their fellow man. They have set an example for us all.\

Some segments of the media have speculated that the participation of independent pilots was especially high because of crime-deterrence policies introduced by Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval. The Defence Force of Amitrite dismissed these claims, calling them \a crass attack on brave men and women who risked their lives to help strangers\.

When asked by reporters which agency would be responsible for the investigation, he replied that the Federal Security Service would act as the lead agency, but resources from any law enforcement agency would be available to assist.

Shadow President Winters was quick to respond to the President's announcement:

\While it is good to see the President responding to genuine concerns, I can't help but notice that he is ignoring our call for an open investigation.\

Emperor's Dawn Appeal Meets with Mixed Response \n \nEmperor's Dawn Appeal Meets with Mixed Response

Two weeks ago, the organisation known as Emperor's Dawn issued a public appeal for progenitor cells and narcotics. Given the group's extremist ideals, the response was understandably mixed. Many of those who oppose the Empire were only too happy to help, but for others \u2013 even those with no particular affinity for Imperial ideals \u2013 the idea of helping a known enemy of the Empire was unthinkable. The result was that while the request for progenitor cells was successful, the request for narcotics was not \u2013 a result that no doubt reflects the divided attitude towards Emperor's Dawn. The question of what impact this will have on the organisation and its ability to further its agenda remains to be answered.

* Professor Ishmael Palin Responds to Proposal
Professor Ishmael Palin Responds to Proposal \n \nLast week, The Voice of Varati published a message from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, an independent scientific body, inviting Professor Ishmael Palin to join their organisation. Professor Palin recently made headlines when his Federation-backed programme to research the so-called anomalous extraterrestrial objects (or AEOs) was abruptly terminated. When asked for a response to the message, Professor Palin made his feelings clear:

\I admire the enthusiasm of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, but I sense that our respective philosophies concerning the anomalous extraterrestrial objects are somewhat at odds with each other. So while I am flattered by their invitation, I feel I must decline.\

Since the AEOs were first discovered, there has been considerable conjecture concerning their origin and purpose, but Professor Palin once again refused to participate in the speculation:

\The objects are certainly mysterious, and I can understand the impulse to speculate, but the fact is that we don't yet know anything definite about them. That is what our research was designed to address.\

* A Week in Powerplay
A Week in Powerplay \n \nEdmund Mahon's policies have allowed the Alliance to achieve new levels of prosperity this week. With optimism and trading profits reaching new highs, it's never been better to be a part of the Alliance. Following the prosperity of the past week, two influential systems pledged their support to the Alliance, and the Council of Admirals reported successfully thwarting numerous incursions seeking to spoil the Alliance's blossoming golden age.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's administration stabilized last week, but once again there is turbulence in her domain. As a result, four systems have begun to question whether Arissa's administration meets their needs. Some have questioned whether the difficulties plaguing Senator Lavigny-Duval's administration in recent weeks stem from her preoccupation with the closed session of the Imperial Senate, where the question of Emperor Hengist's successor is being decided.

Zachary Hudson's approval rating fell slightly this week, but overall the President maintained his standing in relation to other major powers. Heavy undermining took place throughout the President's territory, but overall the Federation fleets under Hudson's command weathered the storm well. The fly in the ointment this week came in the form of a complaint lodged by the Katurru system.

Felicia Winters endured setbacks in her attempt to forge diplomatic agreements during the past two weeks, but she also deflected serious opposition to her rule with aggressive community outreach and aid to systems in need. Her command capital reserves are not as deep as in recent weeks, but funding is available for media teams to spread liberal values to at least one system this week.

Li Yong-Rui was disappointed, as deals that would have incorporated additional systems into the Sirius portfolio fell through. Sirius's investors remain optimistic about the corporation's future performance, as deals with wealthy systems lie on the horizon. With the ongoing study of Sothis Crystalline Gold, Sirius stocks are soaring.

Following the negative press surrounding the potential involvement of one of the Aisling's patrons in the Emperor's assassination, two systems pulled support a week ago, followed by four additional systems this week. The People's Princess now looks forward to the events of the coming week, and the decision of the senate on the matter of the Imperial succession.

Zemina Torval made great strides, as her enterprise expanded its influence into three valuable systems. With this news, the elderly senator has demonstrated her frailty is a figment of her detractors' imaginations. With a vast command capital reserve, Senator Torval is in a strong position to offer several systems the opportunity to become preferred trading partners this week.

Denton Patreus fought to stabilize his territory this week, following recent conflicts with Emperor's Dawn. The cost of the conflicts, combined with regular undermining in the Senator's territory, led to the loss of one key system, although three others that had been in turmoil were retained. The senator now looks to recoup some of the strength that was spent, and to take positive steps leading to a stronger future.

Pranav Antal authorized Utopians to send humanitarian aid to the Munshin system to support the displaced Pegasi Sector citizens. Polevnic's finest commanders sallied forth, crossing hundreds of light years to deliver much-needed medical supplies. The emphasis placed on this mercy mission came at the cost of further advancement of Utopian ideals in surrounding systems.

Archon Delaine and his ruthless crew met with success this week as they brought the resistance force of HIP 106072 to its knees. Those who resisted paid the inevitable price in blood, their families sold into slavery. The expansion of the Kumo Crew comes as a blow to those who have fought for months to end the tyranny of the pirate lord. Analysts now suspect the harassment of refugee ships served as a distraction that allowed the Kumo Crew to conquer this remote world.


* Scandal Rocks Chancellor Anders Blaine
Scandal Rocks Chancellor Anders Blaine \n \nLittle has been heard from Princess Aisling Duval since it was revealed that one of her key advisors, Patron Damon Clarke, was connected to Emperor's Dawn. She has reportedly cooperated with both the Senate and IISS investigations into the allegations, and has vehemently denied any prior knowledge of the link.

That changed this morning with the shattering announcement of her own investigation's findings. In a statement, Princess Aisling revealed that some of Chancellor Anders Blaine's past advisors were connected to the same members of Emperor's Dawn as Patron Damon Clarke. She also highlighted that while Patron Clarke's connection to Emperor's Dawn was historic, those within the Chancellor's team were more recent.

She concluded by listing the names of those implicated. Princess Aisling Duval has not yet released evidence of the connections.

Chancellor Anders Blaine denied all knowledge of any connection, and refused to comment further.


* Preparation for 'Bacon Protests' Anniversary Underway
Preparation for 'Bacon Protests' Anniversary Underway \n \nToday, a spokesperson for the Bacon Cats, a cooperative of independent pilots, addressed plans to host a spectacular celebration to mark the upcoming anniversary of the so-called 'Bacon Protests'. The spokesperson, Julissa Silver, released the following statement:

\It's true that we're planning something special. We invite everyone to come together, in a spirit of celebration, to commemorate the repeal of the ill-thought-out and short-lived prohibition laws here in the Carnoeck system. There will be many historic exhibits and displays, but most importantly there will be free bacon and libations for all visitors.\

Import demands in Carnoeck have hit new highs in recent weeks, and demand for goods continues to rise while locals speculate about the nature of the celebrations. One shuttle pilot was quoted as saying: \Beer and liquor are flying out of depots faster than pilots can bring them in! It's going to be one heck of a party.\

Members of the Bacon Cats have said that the celebrations will be positive and respectful, but some news outlets have raised concerns about the event, predicting astronomical policing costs, and speculating that it could attract pirates and other unwanted elements to the Carnoeck system.

* Emperor's Dawn: What does it stand for?
Emperor's Dawn: What does it stand for? \n \nSince news of Emperor's Dawn first emerged, there has been extensive speculation about the group's agenda. That the organisation wants to destabilise the Imperial power base seems highly likely, given that it was almost certainly responsible for the assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval, but the specifics of its ambitions have remained unclear.

Propaganda material disseminated by Emperor's Dawn has been thoroughly examined, but the generalities it contains, and the vague promises of returning Imperial society to 'traditional values', have done little to illuminate the group's philosophy. Some commentators have suggested that the organisation may be deliberately avoiding making an explicit statement for fear of discouraging potential recruits. After all, if you are intentionally vague about what you stand for, people may assume you stand for the same things they do.

All this has changed, however, with the recovery of an internal Emperor's Dawn statement, released by an individual claiming to be a former member of the organisation. The following text is taken verbatim from the document:

\The Empire has become irrevocably decadent, and stands at a vast remove from the noble ideals that birthed it. In anticipation of its inevitable collapse, we, Emperor's Dawn, Heralds of the New Imperial Age, have compiled the following edicts, to be delivered to the Empire at an appropriate time. We demand that Emperor's Dawn be free to determine the appointment of a new Emperor, that the corrupt and amoral Imperial Senate be immediately disbanded, and that the equivocation and leniency that has neutered the Imperial military be stamped out, to be replaced with a philosophy of total martial conviction.\

The identity of the individual who provided the information is not known, but it is understood that Imperial security experts believe the material to be genuine. The office of Senator Denton Patreus responded to the release of the document with a brief statement:

\This information does not change the Senator's position regarding Emperor's Dawn. It is an enemy of the Empire, and it will be destroyed.\


* GalNet Weekly Expansion List
GalNet Weekly Expansion List \n \nEach week, GalNat presents a list of 10 of the 1,326 minor factions currently expanding into new systems (*).

Future of Ngulungbara

Hirapa Empire League

Abi Progressive Party

Albisaki Prison Colony

Zangpo Travel Company

Vucumanada Patron's Principles

Dukes of Jafenhar

Nobles of Nicopa

Kongkhulym Silver Central Co

Puruma Travel Solutions

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

* Pioneer Returns from the Depths
Pioneer Returns from the Depths \n \nOn the 5th of January 3301, an explorer by the name of Commander Kommodore set off to visit Sagittarius A* in his Eagle-class starship \u2013 the first known attempt to reach the core in such a vessel.

Nothing more was heard from this intrepid explorer until this week, some ten months later, when his trusty Eagle finally returned to a friendly starport. The Commander was said to have a made a rough landing due to the time that had elapsed since he last experienced docking procedures.

During his ten-month mission, believed to be one of the longest on record, the explorer catalogued information on almost 3,900 star systems, and was awarded a staggering 123 million credits from Universal Cartographics for the data he amassed.

Core Dynamics, manufacturers of the Eagle Mk II, has expressed an interest in having Commander Kommodore's ship permanently berthed for posterity, and to show just how durable this little ship is.

* Chancellor Anders Blaine Issues Statement
Chancellor Anders Blaine Issues Statement \n \nIn the early hours of this morning, agents of the Imperial Guard and IISS arrested several members of Chancellor Anders Blaine's staff. He later released a statement:

\It deeply pains me that members of my staff have brought such shame to my name and office. I regret to admit that Princess Aisling Duval's accusations are true, and that members of my staff have been instrumental, albeit without my knowledge, in conducting a campaign of slander against the Princess.

\I take full responsibility for the actions of those in my employ, and offer my full and unconditional apologies to Princess Aisling.\

It is difficult to predict how this development will affect the succession vote. On the one hand, the Chancellor's link to Emperor's Dawn will inevitably damage his standing, despite his apparent ignorance of the connection. On the other, his contrition may go some way toward salvaging his reputation.


* Fuel Rats Complete 2,000th Rescue
Fuel Rats Complete 2,000th Rescue \n \nIn the 38 days since the Fuel Rats' last made headlines, the group has rescued a further 1,000 ships, bringing the total number of Commanders saved from a frustrating insurance experience to 2,000.

Financial experts have speculated that this service could have saved the Galactic economy as much as 1 billion credits in insurance buyback premiums, not counting the value of lost cargo, exploration data, and bounty vouchers.

In a statement, the Fuel Rats extended special congratulations to Commander KitsuneThe Fluff and Commander Radlock for each achieving 100 individual rescues, with Commander KitsuneThe Fluff being the first to achieve this distinction. Commander Radlok was also singled out for praise after completing 100 rescues in just 45 days.

On behalf of the galaxy at large, we thank you for your service, Commanders. The dedication you have shown in saving your fellow spacefarers from misfortune is to be applauded.

* Imperial Succession Vote in Senate Today
Imperial Succession Vote in Senate Today \n \nToday is the last day of deliberation for the Senate over the question of who will become the next Emperor. By law, the Senate must announce the new Emperor by a clear majority decision tomorrow. Meanwhile, many are asking how a group like Emperor's Dawn could establish so many high-level contacts, and keep such a widespread extremist organisation secret for so long. It is clear that the new Emperor, whoever it may be, will be faced with challenges from the moment he or she assumes the throne.

Chancellor Blaine was considered the strongest candidate for the throne, particularly given the deadlock between Princess Aisling Duval and Senator Arissa Lavigny-Duval. But the recent revelation of his indirect connection to Emperor's Dawn leaves the two women as the most convincing contenders. The Princess's chances were dealt a blow by the revelation of her own connections to Emperor's Dawn. With Senator Lavigny-Duval receiving public support from Senators Patreus and Torval, some believe she has an advantage. Overall, however, the two are too closely matched to be able to confidently call a winner.


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
GalNet Weekly Economic Report \n \nIn this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 3,066 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Samkyha State Network

Maljenni Netcoms Commodities

Lan Tzak Jet General Corporation

Defence Force of HR 8793

Purple Creative Industry

Maridal Commodities

Karsuki Ti Purple Electronics

q1 Eridani Gold Crew

United Umbrigua Conservatives

Orang Purple Fortune and Co

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

* Senate Declares Arissa Lavigny-Duval Emperor
Standing on the steps of the Senate building, Chancellor Anders Blaine announced the Senate's decision on the succession. In a historic selection, and as a result of a clear majority vote, Arissa Lavigny-Duval will be the next ruler of the Empire. She will be the first female leader of the Empire since Marlin Duval founded the original colony on Achenar in the 23rd Century, although she will carry the title 'Emperor' rather than 'Empress'. Such an appointment would have been impossible prior to the reign of Hengist Duval due to an ancient decree that all Imperial rulers be male, but a ruling passed by the late Emperor early in his reign did away with this generations-old tradition.

The news has been almost universally celebrated, and even Princess Aisling Duval offered her support for the appointment. The celebrations are likely to continue until the coronation ceremony in a week's time.

Not everyone agrees with the Senate's decision, however. In a statement, Emperor's Dawn declared the selection of Arissa Lavigny-Duval \a desecration of the traditions of the Empire\. The organisation has vowed not to allow the ceremony to happen.


* Remembering the Victims of the Cerberus Plague
The Cerberus Plague was one of the most devastating outbreaks to blight the galaxy for generations, devastating dozens of systems and affecting countless worlds. Official figures place the death toll at over 100,000.

As of today, however, the disease is officially considered extinct. Carl Simmons, the specialist who led research into a cure, has confirmed that no new outbreaks of the plague have been reported since early August, and that the disease can therefore be considered eradicated.

This announcement follows months of work from medical teams across the galaxy, who \u2013 with the support of many independent pilots \u2013 have laboured tirelessly to deliver the Cerberus antidote to those affected by the plague.

To mark this event, and in remembrance of those who lost their lives to the Cerberus Plague, officials at Hart Station have commissioned a special memorial. Governor Albrecht, administrator of Hart Station, unveiled the monument with the following words:

\It is my solemn duty to dedicate this memorial to the many men, women and children whose lives were claimed by the Cerberus Plague. Their light may be gone from the galaxy, but they will live on in our hearts.\


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems (*).

Here are 10 of the 507 minor factions in lockdown:

Tsim Binba Imperial Society

Kereng Dimani Natural Ltd

LTT 3007 Crimson Syndicate

Marasing Group

Meiri Fortune Industries

Values Party of Tau Bootis

Adeo Independents

LTT 5964 Crimson Universal Sysy

Liberals of LP 417-213

HIP 98211 Silver Electronics

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 727 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Kapoongzi Empire Party

LP 906-9 Blue Natural Group

Yamatzicni Crimson Mafia

Malaikudi Regulatory State

Regulatory State of HIP 32812

Tamar Blue Natural and Co

Pontar Purple Posse

Clan of Adenses

Defence Party of Cumalam

United Nguna Democrats

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Data is correct at time of publishing.


* GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots
This weekly report typically covers some of the minor factions experiencing significant health issues, such as famine and outbreaks. At the time of writing, however, outbreaks have not been reported among any minor factions.


* GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming
In the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT), the GalNet monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled.

Any pilots who operate for one of the powers must deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time to ensure their activities are registered.


* Federal Times Reporter Lends Weight to 'Master Chef' Story
Earlier today, an anonymous message was delivered to a number of news feeds claiming that secret genetic experiments were being conducted in the Noti system. Many commentators dismissed the message as a hoax, but now it seems the claims may have a basis in reality. Marc Garfield, a reporter for the Federal Times, has allegedly seen the so-called 'master chefs' first hand, and the encounter clearly made an impression:

\There's a secret training facility at Weber Gateway \u2013 I managed to sneak in through an air vent. In one room I saw a bunch of slaves chopping vegetables, blindfolded, while a deafening alarm went off. If the slaves dropped below a certain rate of efficiency or precision, they were given an electric shock. In another room they were navigating an assault course while making a souffl\u00e9. At least I think it was a souffl\u00e9 \u2013 I'm not an expert. I've never seen anything like it.\

Garfield is a respected journalist, and his testimony lends considerable credibility to the 'master chef' story. The journalist also claims that the appeal from the Revolutionary Noti Value Party for Aganippe Rush has been coordinated by the organisation that created the master chefs, and he has suggested that the appeal may be part of an initiative to bring the gourmet slaves to market as a tradable commodity.


* The Bacon City Hangover
Last week, the starport of Bacon City played host to the inaugural Bacon Protests anniversary celebrations, which commemorated the repeal of the meat ban that affected citizens of the Carnoeck system in 3288. Revellers from across the galaxy descended on Bacon City to join in the fun, and hundreds of independent pilots ferried animal meat and narcotics to the starport to fuel the festivities.

The event was not without problems, however, as the steady stream of traders and party goers attracted pirates and other disruptive elements to Bacon City. At one point, the starport was blockaded by an animal-rights group, who ordered ships carrying animal meat to jettison their cargo at gunpoint.

A spokesperson for United Carnoeck for Equality, the event's sponsors, released the following announcement:

\For the most part the celebrations have been a huge success, but an event like this is bound to attract a few unsavoury elements. Fortunately we anticipated such an eventuality, and set aside some money for the post-party cleanup. So if you're a bounty hunter and you want to help clear the spaceways around Bacon City, get yourself to the Carnoeck system! We'll make it worth your while.\


* The Master Chefs \u2013 Truth or Hoax?
An anonymous message has been delivered to a number of news feeds claiming that clandestine genetic experiments are being carried out in Noti system. The message, which was delivered in the early hours of the morning, asserts that an unnamed organisation has secretly created a new strain of slave labour. The full contents of the message are as follows:

\I don't know what they're called \u2013 they hide behind various dummy companies \u2013 but I know what they're doing. They target people that match a specific genetic template, and kidnap them when they're just kids. Then they subject them to the most punishing, dehumanising training imaginable. By the end of it, the subject is barely even human. Their compassion and empathy have been completely hammered out of them. All that's left is the desire to cook. They call these creations...the Master Chefs.\

Is the message legitimate, or is it just an imaginative hoax? We leave you to decide.


* More Emperor's Dawn Bases Found
Two weeks ago, the Imperial Internal Security Service issued a request for exploration data as part of its ongoing effort to locate bases belonging to the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn. The request resulted in a raft of fresh astrological data, which has since been subjected to rigorous analysis by the IISS. This in turn has produced a list of star systems that the IISS believes contain Emperor's Dawn bases: Namarii, Tabaldak, LTT 874, Shambhala and Svari.

Some commentators have expressed surprise at the Empire's decision to release the information, given its importance to the Imperial campaign, but Senator Denton Patreus, who is leading the fight against Emperor's Dawn, has no reservations:

\Surprise is not a significant factor at this stage of the campaign. Let the insurgents prepare for our arrival. They cannot hope to withstand the full might of the Empire. We will crush them.\

Having already eradicated an Emperor's Dawn cell in Maausk, it is assumed that the Empire will soon launch military campaigns against the remaining insurgent bases.


* GalNet Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections (*).

Here are 10 of the 2,833 minor factions holding elections:

Rishair Emperor's Grace

V2689 Orionis Jet Transport Ltd

V2689 Orionis Limited

Conservatives of Antilope

Constitution Party of Antilope

LTT 9573 Company

LTT 9573 Crimson Advanced Ltd

Flech Systems

Flech Bridge Systems

Ho Hsien Corporation

Elections occur when two minor factions of a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.

* Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Increased Security on Capitol
With Emperor's Dawn threatening to sabotage the Imperial coronation ceremony, and the Emperor's assassination still casting a pall over the city, security for the ceremony has been drastically increased. Naval infantry, local police and Imperial Guard units are already patrolling the streets of Capitol and conducting security checks. One Navy contact revealed that this was likely to be one of the largest deployments of Naval troops in decades.

The population has responded positively to the increased security measures, with many locals claiming they would accept any level of protection to prevent another occurrence like the murder of the Emperor.

The security extends beyond Capitol's surface, and in contrast to the Emperor's funeral, only invited guests or those with the appropriate permits will be allowed to enter the Achenar system. This has upset some offworld citizens who wanted to witness the procession first hand, but like the people of Capitol they have demonstrated understanding.


* A Week in Powerplay
Edmund Mahon remains optimistic despite the projections of some economic analysts, citing the fact that the Alliance still boasts the most profitable economy of any power. Despite the pessimistic reports, influential systems are still flocking to the Alliance, with two more joining in the past week. The coming weeks will validate the opinion of either the Prime Minister or the critical analysts.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval experienced a momentous week in several ways, particularly her recent confirmation as the next Emperor. Only the threats of Emperor's Dawn appear to stand in her way now. The past week saw the closing of the embassy with the Sirius Corporation at Sietae. Relations between the Sirius Corp. and the Empire remain friendly. Four additional key systems subscribed to the protection of the Shield of Justice in the past week.

Felicia Winters's approval rating has surpassed that of President Hudson for the first time in over a month. With a marked dip in opposition figures, Shadow President Winters was able to build up a command capital reserve that will serve her forces well in the coming week.

Zachary Hudson's approval rating fell again this week as the Katurru system formally rejected the protection of Federation fleets. President Hudson's fleets more than compensated for the loss of Katurru by establishing bases of operation in three additional systems. The advent of the Close Quarters Combat Championship remains a wild card for the President - his public endorsement of CQC as a recruitment tool for the Federation Navy may lead to a rise in approval in the near future.

Li Yong-Rui has put SiriusGov on track for steady growth. This week has seen the assets of one additional control system brought into the Sirius portfolio. Many investors would hope for more rapid growth and quick profits, but many shareholders recognize the value of a steady future of tempered growth. Li Yong-Rui appears most interested in the latter.

Aisling Duval dealt with the results of the Senate's decision on the Imperial succession with grace, offering her support to the pronouncement, and popular opinion of the People's Princess appears to be on the rebound.

Zemina Torval brought two profitable systems into her enterprise during the past week, ensuring yet another week with a high command capital reserve. Trade routes in Senator Torval's territory reportedly rival those of the Alliance. Things continue to look good for the wizened senator.

Denton Patreus returned to Eotienses this week after a month in Achenar for the closed session of the Senate. His fleets appear to have recovered from recent weeks of conflict with Emperor's Dawn just as new Emperor's Dawn bases have been discovered in five systems. In anticipation of the coming engagements, fortification projects in the Senator's systems are currently in full swing.

Archon Delaine and the Kumo Crew claimed another system, the second week of expansion in a row. Analysts of the war effort in the Pegasi Sector have questioned the effectiveness of the Imperial expeditionary fleets and the voluntary forces that have opposed the Kumo Crew. Criminal activity has been spotted, spurring insurrections this week in two influential Federal systems and one Imperial system.

Pranav Antal now governs an impressive 43 control systems. The achievement is even more remarkable when one considers that mere months ago the vision of Utopia was shared by a mere handful of systems. Many doubted whether Antal's vision for the future would gain any traction, but he has proven beyond all doubt that the ideals of Utopia are more enticing than originally believed.


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report
This weekly transmission lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy, based on the latest data.

Here are 10 of the 21,924 minor factions involved in a civil war:

Ross 720 Crimson Cartel

Mundjiga Patrons of Law

Mariyacoch Solutions

El Tio Empire Party

Mariyacoch for Equality

Dewindji Silver Energy Ind

Confederation of Dewindji

Comanes Purple Drug Empire

Comanes Gold Dynamic Limited

Democrats of HIP 24777

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 3,374 minor factions at war:

Codorain Emperor's Grace

Karnarki Blue General Company

Komovoy Crimson Posse

Kivah Resistance

Saisiyat Patron's Principles

Okua'gsa Empire Party

Xerente Blue Transport Comms

Movement for Ariminimi Labour Union

Jet Travel Services

Miskai Incorporated

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Olympus Corp Thanks the Fuel Rats
Commander F-Zlim was on the home stretch of a six-month galactic tour when a CO2 leak knocked him out. When he woke to the blare of alarms, his ship, the 'Korblah', was out of fuel. Using long-range comms, F-Zlim notified fellow Commanders at the exploration arm of the Olympus Corp. that he had exactly two minutes and 48 seconds of air remaining. Using the last of the ship's backup battery, he transmitted his final location via the captain's log module, and then he called the Fuel Rats.

\I had 50 seconds of oxygen left when the first refuel drone arrived,\ said Commander F-Zlim. \It was the most exhilarating and frightening experience in the six months of my journey. The Fuel Rats saved me and I am eternally grateful.\

In recognition of for their valiant service, the Olympus Corporation has chosen to award the first-ever Korblah Medal to Commanders Orphius and Lokda Babybel of the Fuel Rats.

* GalNet Weekly Expansion List
Each week, GalNat presents a list of 10 of the 1,738 minor factions currently expanding into new systems.

GD 69 Advanced Industries

HIP 3470 as one

Ualarni Solutions

United Olokulu Party

Frentani Co

Aristocrats of Lauket

Revolutionary Shebera Coalition

HIP 103583 as one

Uniting Martudja

HIP 112389 Purple Major Holdings

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Who is Funding Emperor's Dawn?
As the war between the Empire and Emperor's Dawn continues, an increasing number of political commentators are asking the question: where does the organisation get its money?

Since the military campaign began, the Empire has expended substantial resources fighting the insurgents, but for the most part Emperor's Dawn has managed to match the strength of the Imperial offensives, and this ability to resist the Empire suggests that the organisation has access to significant levels of funding. Several weeks ago it was revealed that Emperor's Dawn had at one time received backing from D and C Shipping, Inc., an organisation belonging to the Imperial patron and industrialist Damon Clarke, but the connection between the two organisations is believed to have been severed some time ago.

Verifiable details are scarce, but an anonymous source within the Empire has shared suspicions that Emperor's Dawn could have a benefactor in the corporate world. If this is true, it raises the question of what kind of company would support an organisation like Emperor's Dawn, and what it might hope to gain from such an association.

The IISS was approached for comment, but it replied only by saying it was \pursuing all available leads\.


* Prime Minister Mahon Holds Influence over 1,000 Systems
The office of Edmund Mahon has announced the signing of the Prime Minister's one thousandth trade agreement. This is a momentous achievement for the Prime Minister and his supporters, and a testament to the hard work and dedication of independent pilots throughout the Alliance. The achievement is impressive given the Prime Minister's relatively small number of supporters. It is also important to remember that Mahon's space doesn't have the reach of the combined borders of the Federation, and has far less than the Empire. It is evidence that the Alliance should be counted among the galaxy's major powers, and a pointed reminder that it intends to maintain its autonomy.

* Emperor's Dawn Connected to Universal Cartographics Security Breach
Exploration activity has been brought to a near standstill after a data-encrypting firmware bug threatened to compromise recently acquired astronomical data. A spokesperson for Universal Cartographics released the following statement:

\Commanders started noting discrepancies between the exploration records stored in their ship systems and their own personal records. When we investigated, we found that one of our contractors has purposely altered a recent firmware update that was applied to all discovery and surface scanners. We also found that the contractor had a connection to Emperor's Dawn. An arrest warrant has been issued, and our staff worked through the weekend to recover the encrypted data and replace the compromised firmware.\

It has been speculated that the sabotage was designed to hamstring the IISS's efforts to locate Emperor's Dawn bases using exploration data.

* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 6,333 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Liberty Party of Tau Ceti\t

Official Palengue Liberty Party

LP 681-91 Ring

Sibio Purple Power Systems

Dakshu Partners

Rathakako Shared

Crimson Dynamic Commodities

Kapurri Empire League

CD-54 9671 Patron's Principles

HIP 100685 Purple Travel Limited

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

* Elegance in Simplicity
Gutamaya Shipyards' latest vessel, the Imperial Eagle, is now available for purchase for any pilot holding the appropriate rank in the Imperial Navy, and positive consumer feedback is already flooding in.

Commander Corrigendum, operating in the Prism system, said: \The Imperial Eagle is a blast to fly. It handles beautifully and has looks to match. I was able to stick on the tail of an Imperial Courier during combat exercises. It's a great addition to the Gutamaya portfolio.\ Commander Stateira 'Starcloak' Eleshenar added: \I love my Eagle, so I was curious to see if Gutamaya could improve on Core Dynamics' classic design. Now I've taken it out a few times, I'm happy to say it retains all the sublime responsiveness of the Eagle, and packs a harder punch in combat.\

When asked about the secret of Gutamaya Shipyards' success, lead engineer Ines Allende responded: \Elegance in simplicity. We kept the core design that made the Eagle Mk II great and simply tinkered with a few key elements.\

* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,519 minor factions in lockdown:

Wolf 1182 Values Party

G 214-14 Clan

Union of G 69-11 Progressive Party

Confederacy of Jeticans

Wilastsi Confederacy

V740 Cassiopeiae Hand Gang

Huiche Blue Gang

Midgcut Jet Dynamic Commodities

HIP 103654 Jet Major Commodities

New Unktomi Democrats

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,976 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

HIP 16460 Empire Consulate

Cartoi Life Company

Buricasses Citizens of Tradition

Psi Capricorni Purple Brothers

Epsilon Scorpii Central Corp.

AF Leporis Nobles

Independent Pichanto Alliance

Ayethi Citizens of Tradition

Uzumeru Netcoms Incorporated

Clan of Jadlillke

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Canonn Interstellar Research Group Announces Breakthrough
After months of research, scientists working for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group observed a change in the transmissions emanating from the so-called 'unknown artefacts', also known as 'anomalous extraterrestrial objects' (or AEOs). Now the organisation believes it has decoded at least part of these strange transmissions. Startlingly, the messages appear to contain schematic diagrams of the ships being used to study the objects.

The breakthrough came when Commander Mike Juliett Kilo was inspired to channel a pre-recorded AEO signal into an antique scanner display system he happened to be transporting. \I was prepared to see an alien face or Thargoid warship,\ he said. \I certainly didn't expect to see a Vulture, especially as I was flying one at the time! It sent shivers down my spine.\

As the number of AEOs encountered in the Aries Dark region increases, the debate over the objects continues.


* The War against Emperor's Dawn Continues
Following the Empire's recent discovery of five additional Emperor's Dawn bases, Senator Denton Patreus has despatched military fleets to three of the systems occupied by the insurgents: Namarii, Tabaldak and LTT 874. The Senator has also authorised a number of Empire-aligned factions to reward pilots who join the fight against Emperor's Dawn. The insurgents, meanwhile, have responded in kind, promising to reward pilots who help repel the Imperials.

Some news feeds have speculated that the Senator's actions are designed not only to maintain the pressure on Emperor's Dawn, but also to minimise the chances of the insurgents disrupting Arissa Lavigny-Duval's forthcoming coronation.

The outcome of the battle is by no means certain, but one thing is for sure \u2013 the wider conflict between the Empire and Emperor's Dawn is far from over.


* Sirius Corporation Announces New Programme
Earlier this year, the Sirius Corporation expanded into the systems of HIP 8396, Almagest, Sothis, Ceos, and Robigo. At the time, a number of economists predicted that these systems would witness dramatic change after being brought under Sirius Corp. control, but in fact the affected systems have remained much the same, with citizens reporting little difference to their everyday lives.

It seems, however, that the Sirius Corporation might simply have been biding its time. In a statement released today, Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of the Sirius Corp., announced ambitious plans to revitalise his company's new holdings:

\Over the coming weeks, the Sirius Corporation will subsidize a number of initiatives designed to revive the social and economic health of our new territories. These initiatives, which will rely heavily on support from independent contractors and pilots, will reinvigorate the economies of the affected systems, and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for our compatriots.\

Roberta Unwin, an economist who regularly contributes to the Money Matters news feed, commented on the announcement:

\Wealthy organisations often expand into new areas without any immediate plans in mind. Sometimes it's because they think the area will become profitable \u2013 other times it's done to undercut a rival. It's called speculative expansion. It's actually rather common, although it usually takes place on a much smaller scale.\

It appears the Sirius Corp. is eager to get started. The first of its initiatives is due to begin today, with the company appealing to independent pilots to deliver osmium to the HIP 8396 system, and promising to reward participants generously.


* Gifts for the New Emperor
On Sunday, Arissa Lavigny-Duval will be crowned Emperor. Preparations for the coronation are almost complete, and the population of Capitol is eagerly awaiting the inauguration of the Empire's first female ruler. To mark this prestigious occasion, the future Emperor has invited galactic citizens to bring her gifts in exchange for certain incentives. In a statement, Lavigny-Duval said:

\It has long been a tradition for Imperial citizens to bestow gifts upon their new ruler. For the first time, and in keeping with the inclusive philosophy I intend to cultivate, I am extending this invitation to all galactic citizens. Anyone who wishes to do so may deliver coronation gifts, in the form of slaves, to Achenar.\

The request for slaves is likely to invoke the ire of anti-slavery groups, but the Empire has underscored the fact that all slaves \u2013 not only Imperial slaves \u2013 will be accepted. This means that any non-Imperial slaves brought to Achenar will be reclassified as Imperial slaves, which will almost certainly improve their quality of life.

Pilots who respond to the request will be offered discounts on Imperial ships, as well as being granted access to vessels that would ordinarily require a rank in the Imperial Navy. The permit restrictions on Achenar have also been temporarily lifted to allow pilots to deliver gifts to the future Emperor.


* Carnoeck System Clean up Nearly Over
Last week, United Carnoeck for Equality issued a public appeal for help in clearing the Carnoeck system of pirates and other disruptive elements. The agitators had congregated in the Carnoeck system in the wake of the Bacon Protests anniversary celebrations, and were harassing traders and revellers travelling to and from Bacon City.

The response to the appeal was overwhelmingly positive, with hundreds of combat pilots taking to their ships and heading for the Carnoeck system. The resulting conflict lasted for several days and raged throughout Carnoeck, and ultimately succeeded in routing the disruptive elements. United Carnoeck for Equality will soon be issuing rewards to pilots who helped to clear the spaceways of agitators.


* Appeal for Aganippe Rush Comes to an End
The Revolutionary Noti Value Party, a group based in the Noti system, recently issued an open contract for Aganippe Rush, a rare commodity found only in the Aganippe system. Although the faction chose not to publicise the reason for the request, the response was positive, with hundreds of independent pilots making the journey to Aganippe to gather quantities of the unusual commodity. Authorities at Weber Gateway, were the deliveries were taken, even had to take on additional staff to deal with the influx of trade ships.

A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Noti Value Party released a brief statement:

\We are extremely grateful to everyone who contributed to this initiative. Aganippe Rush is not a widely available commodity, and we appreciate the lengths pilots went to in order to deliver it to us at Weber Gateway.\

The Revolutionary Noti Value Party was asked to elaborate on the reason for its request, but the organisation declined to respond.

* A Week in Powerplay
Edmund Mahon has proven last week's naysaying economists wrong. The economic juggernaut that is the Alliance of Independent Systems now exerts influence over more than 1,000 systems \u2013 a tremendous milestone for the fledgling superpower, which only recently celebrated 70 years of existence.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's days have been largely consumed by preparations for her coronation ceremony, but she has also made time to direct the efforts of the Shield of Justice. The Emperor-to-be oversaw massive fortifications during the past week, with 50 systems secured against little opposition. Everything appears to be in order for the coronation ceremony this weekend.

Zachary Hudson amassed an enormous command capital stockpile in the previous week, alongside an increase in approval rating. Federal Navy recruitment levels are also at an all-time high, with many attributing the increased interest in the Navy to the CQC Championships.

Felicia Winters and the liberal arm of the Federation have stockpiled sufficient resources to establish bases in a handful of systems, which will serve as staging points for future aid programs. Mangwe became one such base of operation during the past week.

In the past week, Aisling Duval's supporters convinced the population of an influential system to support the people's princess, and her public-relations machine now appears primed to persuade additional systems to join Aisling's cause.

Li Yong-Rui recently announced an initiative to bolster the economy of the distant colony of HIP 8396. This program comes at an odd time for Sirius, as profits fell during the past week, resulting in strained business relations with two systems.

Denton Patreus has at last established a small cushion of command capital with which to exert additional influence over systems bordering his territory. The elimination of Emperor's Dawn remains among the Senator's top priorities, and as his fleets deploy, fortifications are underway to guard against further expansion of the insurgent organization.

Zemina Torval's enterprises suffered some setbacks this week, resulting in turmoil for one popular trade system. Given the Senator's recent track record, economic analysts are not overly concerned about trade in her systems, and expect this to be a minor hiccup.

Pranav Antal continued Utopia's quiet march through civilized space with the addition of the Xi Wang Mu system. Antal now has a modest command capital reserve with which to expand the vision of Utopia.

Archon Delaine's attempts to exploit additional systems were denied this week, as system defence forces repelled Kumo Crew-backed insurrectionists. The spider of the Pegasi Sector is already spinning webs to ensnare additional systems. It remains to be seen whether the renewed offensive against Emperor's Dawn will weaken the Imperial resistance to the Pirate Lord.

* Technical Trouble in the Warkushanui System
Reports coming in from the Warkushanui system indicate that a number of starports in the region are currently experiencing technical issues. According to Sam Norris, a technician at Coats Hub, the system's inhabitants are dealing with a range of problems:

\We've had power outages, intermittent problems with our communications, and issues with the docking systems, but I've reason to believe that things are worse at Gurragchaa Gateway. I haven't been able to establish a stable comms link with them for a while, though, so I don't know exactly what the situation is.\

Norris was asked what he thought might be causing the problems:

\Beats the hell out of me. The generators are fine and I haven't identified any infrastructure issues, so we'll need to run some tests before we can be sure.\

The issues in Warkushanui are not believed to be affecting station services at this time.


* GalNet Weekly Conflict Report
This weekly transmission lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy, based on the latest data.

Here are 10 of the 25,801 minor factions involved in a civil war:

He Xingo Crimson Dynamic and Co

League of Gomm Crua Party

Gomm Crua Corporation

Vordengha Noblement

Vordengha Purple Syndicate

Pic Tok Clan

Khruvani Freedom Party

Khruvani Resistance

Ngurii Silver Dragons

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 3,860 minor factions at war:

Honoto Advanced Interstellar

United Nganji Labour

Traditional Kamilagro Dominion\t

Monarchy of Acokwech\t

Values Party of LTT 4428

UGP 184 Imperial Society

Coalition of Awanti

Leaders of Laukaitu

Beta Octantis Empire Group

LHS 2150 Resistance

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

* Arissa Lavigny-Duval Crowned Emperor
Today, dawn broke above an expectant Capitol as Imperial citizens awaited the coronation of the first female Emperor (the Imperial Senate having determined that 'Emperor' should be used for both male and female rulers). It looked like the entire population had come to witness the procession of Arissa Lavigny-Duval through the city to the Imperial Palace.

The crowd's excitement was palpable, but it was undercut by uncertainty over whether the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn would succeed in disrupting the coronation ceremony, as they claimed they would. There have been rumours that Emperor-to-be Arissa refused to travel in a closed speeder, despite concerns for her safety, and she looked every part the Emperor as the procession made its way sedately through the city.

The military and security presence was visible throughout the city, with Naval Infantry in full dress uniform lining the streets. A full company of Imperial Guard marched alongside the Senator's vehicle, their stark black uniforms contrasting with the crisp whites of the Naval Infantry.

The procession arrived at the palace at exactly midday, where the senators and Imperial family waited. The brief ceremony was transmitted live throughout the Empire, and screened at key locations in the city so the crowds could watch. The multitude roared their appreciation to the sky as Emperor-to-be Arissa Lavigny-Duval completed her vows of office.

At the conclusion of the ceremony, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval offered a few words for her people:

\This is a day I cannot compare to any other. The trust my fellow senators have shown in me makes me all the more determined to overcome the challenges we will surely face in the coming weeks and months. For too long we have suffered from uncertainty in the wake of the Emperor's death.

\I had the great fortune to talk with the late Emperor in his final days, and to learn how he planned to strengthen the Empire in these times of change. In the coming weeks, I will announce the formation of my government and my plans to tackle the threats facing the Empire.

\But for now I will enjoy this moment and express my gratitude to the Empire and everyone, from slave to senator, for this opportunity to serve.\


* Pilots Call for Starship Lighting Enquiry
More than 220,000 pilots have signed a petition calling for an inquiry into the lack of anti-collision lights on starships and emergency lighting on system-authority ships. Jenson Zanetti, chairman of the Pilots Federation Safety Board, stated:

\At some point in their careers, most pilots will be struck by an authority or private vessel they did not see, which can be disastrous for both parties. If our proposals are implemented, we predict a massive decrease in the number of fatal collisions in and around space stations.\

The petition calls for all system-authority vessels to be fitted with lighting equipment to help pilots identify these important craft, and for anti-collision lights to be fitted to all starships. The petition concludes by stating that the lights only need to be used within a station's no-fire zone, and when the ship's main lights are active.

* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 11,041 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

People's Meldrith Values Party

Movement for LHS 2429 Democrats

Allied LHS 380 Law Party

Isita Confederation

Tefenhua Alliance Union

Bharu Silver Public Partners

Gakiutl Blue Mafia

Carthage Silver Drug Empire

Maitis Energy Company

Theta Indi Advanced Incorporated

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Poluskapura Industries

Plentauri Transport Incorporated

Aetius aristocrats

Cartoq Purple Major Organisation

HR 5504 Dominion

Barons of Coringha

Clotti Future

Ithelki Netcoms Industries

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 4,742 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Lillith League

Kokowar Group\t

Timbarichs Conservatives

Maiducane Collective

Kolyawa Confederation

Alacagui Holdings

* The Emperor Denounces Emperor's Dawn
To date, the Empire's campaign against the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn has fallen largely under the jurisdiction of Senator Denton Patreus, but now that the question of the succession has been answered, the Empire is in a position to give Emperor's Dawn its full attention. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has issued a frank statement in which she denounces Emperor's Dawn as \an enemy of the Empire\ and promises to give Senator Patreus her full support:

\Emperor's Dawn has gone to great lengths to present itself as being aligned with the Empire's values and ideals, but make no mistake \u2013 this organisation is an enemy of the Empire. Senator Patreus has demonstrated sound judgement in his management of the campaign, and I have every faith in his ability to remove this threat to our civilisation. The operation to destroy Emperor's Dawn will continue under his guidance.\

The statement constitutes the Emperor's first decree as ruler of the Empire, and reflects a clear commitment to Imperial security.


* Technical Issues in Warkushanui Intensify
Recent reports from the Warkushanui system suggest that the technical issues affecting the region are worsening. According to the Federal Times, which spoke with station personnel at Gurragchaa Gateway, starports throughout the system are experiencing a range of inexplicable mechanical problems. A technician at Gurragchaa Gateway said:

\We've got malfunctions and breakdowns cropping up all over the starport, so we're in fire-fighting mode at the moment, but no obvious cause has presented itself yet.\

As the technical problems in Warkushanui intensify, some commentators have drawn attention to the fact that the number of anomalous extraterrestrial objects (or AEOs) discovered in the system has recently increased. The Federal Times asked staff at Gurragchaa Gateway if there could be a connection between the mysterious objects and the breakdowns, but was told only that \all available lines of enquiry were being explored\.

If these problems persist, it seems likely that station services in Warkushanui will soon be affected.


* From Dreams to Reality
For the past few months, a development group founded by the Explorer's Association has been working on plans to build a starport in the Pleiades Nebula. Now, it appears the plans are about to become reality. A spokesperson from the Explorer's Association made the following statement:

\A starport in the Pleiades Nebula would be of tremendous value to pilots, serving as a reliable resupply point and sanctuary in the depths of space. But breaking into deep space is always costly, not to mention potentially dangerous. Fortunately we have received generous support from the Brewer Corporation, Pacap Limited and Universal Cartographics, and are now in a position to begin construction. The first phase of the project involves collecting the necessary materials to create the starport superstructure, and to this end we are willing to offer generous premiums to pilots delivering metals to Neville Horizons, our base of operations. I encourage all those with an interest in exploration to join this exciting project, and contribute to the next phase of humankind's expansion.\

One of the pilots involved in the programme was quoted as saying:

\Hopefully, getting a station farther out into uninhabited space will be the first step towards human expansion out into the wider reaches of the galaxy.\

Pilots who wish to contribute to the campaign should deliver metals to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.


* Sirius Corporation Takes Aim at Pirates
Reports are coming in of pirate activity in the Robigo system, a seldom-visited region of space that was recently brought under the control of the Sirius Corporation. Fortunately for the people of Robigo Mines, the system's only outpost, the Sirius Corporation has a history of taking a zero-tolerance approach to those who threaten its holdings. In fact, the company has already issued bounties on the pirates, offering generous rewards to anyone who helps clear them from the area. In a statement, Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of the Sirius Corp, said:

\The Sirius Corporation has a legal right to protect its assets, and a moral obligation to defend its people. The outpost of Robigo Mines is Sirius Corporation property, and we will not allow it to come to harm. To this end, I have set aside a substantial fund to reward pilots who help to eliminate the pirates operating in the Robigo system.\

* Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval Expresses Gratitude
Last week, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval invited galactic citizens to deliver gifts in honour of her forthcoming coronation. The response was enthusiastic, resulting in hundreds of pilots flocking to the Achenar system to deliver slaves to Dawes Hub. In a statement, the Emperor expressed her gratitude to those who responded to the request:

\I am delighted with the reaction to my appeal. The fact that pilots affiliated with the Federation and Alliance responded to my request fills me with hope for a future of peaceful exchange and cooperation.\

Pilots who took part in the event were offered discounts on Imperial ships, as well as being granted access to vessels that would ordinarily require a rank in the Imperial Navy.


* A Week in Powerplay
Edmund Mahon presided over the finalization of an agreement that resulted in another regionally significant system joining the Alliance. The Prime Minister also praised defensive efforts that kept Alliance territory safe this week. A significant command capital reserve will make additional trade agreements possible during the coming week, further augmenting the Alliance's booming economy.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval was crowned Emperor this week, settling extensive debate over the succession crisis. Since her coronation, the Emperor has busied herself with the management of her vast territory. Two influential systems have pledged their support to the new Emperor in exchange for the enforcement of law and order.

Zachary Hudson's fleets did not secure any additional territory this week, but fortification of the Federation's core worlds ensured that the President will have plenty of opportunity to focus his efforts outward in the near future. In the meantime, the CQC Championship continues to swell the ranks of the Federal Navy.

Felicia Winters has carried on as she has for many weeks now. Undermining of the Shadow President's authority was roughly half that of recent weeks, allowing regular defensive efforts to be focused elsewhere. Should these trends continue, it is likely that Shadow President Winters will be able to expand her aid programs at a greater rate.

Aisling Duval has kept a low profile in recent days, but her followers have been zealous as ever, which led to HIP 114709 pledging its support to Aisling. The public relations machine of people's princess has received additional funding, and is now preparing for multiple media blitzes.

Li Yong-Rui was able to navigate Sirius Gov out of last week's financial straits, finalizing two major business deals that led to the acquisition of two systems. He was also able to amass sufficient reserves to open negotiations with several more systems this week. Sirius stocks are soaring.

Denton Patreus has been embroiled in all-out war with the forces of Emperor's Dawn this week, which has consumed most of his energies, although he did find the time and resources to expand his influence to the Ditae system. With the full support of the Emperor against Emperor's Dawn, it is anticipated that the tide will soon turn against the insurrectionists.

Zemina Torval recovered from last week's financial turmoil with grace and fortitude. Three systems have been added to the senator's list of preferred trading partners, and she now looks forward to establishing even more relationships in the near future.

Pranav Antal succeeded in bringing another system, HIP 108110, into the Utopian fold this week. Utopian enclaves are now present in 45 systems. The peaceful society remains a beacon of hope in times of chaos.

Archon Delaine has amassed a command capital supply greater than he's had in months. With these resources, the Pirate Lord has unleashed an unprecedented wave of blackmail and bribery in systems all around his domain. It is feared that these efforts will lead to several more systems falling to the Pirate Lord in the near future.

* Technical Trouble in 49 Arietis
Amid news that the technical issues plaguing the Warkushanui system have worsened, reports are coming in that starports in the system of 49 Arietis are experiencing similar problems. According to Blake Fry, a commercial freight pilot who regularly traverses the 49 Arietis system, the starport of Gaiman Dock has been hit with a plethora of issues in recent hours, including power outages and system failures. Speaking to the Federal Times, Fry said:

\I don't know exactly what's going on, but they've got problems popping up all over the place. Energy, infrastructure \u2013 everything's on the fritz. They're in a world of pain over there.\

When asked if he had any theories on what was happening at Gaiman Dock, Fry was unequivocal:

\Hey, I read the news. I'm not stupid. First they take those alien pods there, and then there's a complete technical breakdown. Didn't they say those AEO things damaged machinery? Join the dots, man!\

The issues in 49 Arietis are not believed to be affecting station services at this time.

* Fresh Incentive from Emperor's Dawn
The war between the Empire and the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn has taken a decisive turn, as the Empire dealt critical blows to the insurrectionists' forces in the Namarii, Tabaldak and LTT 874 systems this week. In response, Emperor's Dawn has issued a statement indicating that it intends to dramatically increase the amounts it is offering to privateers:

\The Empire thinks that those who fight on its side do so because they share its ideals. We believe they fight because they are well paid. Fortunately, the Imperials are not the only ones who can purchase victory. From this point on, we will give any pilots who fight for our cause double the amount originally offered. Let us see how much people really believe in 'Imperial values'.\

This development is likely to rekindle debate over how the insurgent organisation is funded, given its apparent ability to access significant reserves.


* Fight Club Rocks Athena
At approximately 21:00 on Saturday the 18th October 3301, a slew of heavily armed Cobras began congregating outside Powell Terminal in the Athena system for an all-on-all bloodbath. Millions of credits' worth of insurance claims were issued as the Commanders of the XYZ Fight Club kicked off the 'Cobra Crunch'.

One of the most epic battles of the tournament was the fight between Koldnitz and FlappyHamWallet (both very experienced commanders), who lit up the skies around the Coriolis starport with their lasers and missiles. Much whooping and cheering was heard over comms chatter  for over four hours, after which many congratulatory messages were directed to Commander Estalath, who appeared to be the victor.

Station security has confirmed that several thousand credits' worth of fines were issued, but there was no significant damage done to the station. One station worker reported: \This old girl can withstand a few out-of-control Cobras crashing into her.\ Meanwhile, system authorities were reportedly unhappy about Athena hosting a second XYZ Fight Club event, saying: \we thought they'd host one event and then move on\.

* Commemorative Space Race
To commemorate 'Star Wars', the classic audiovisual entertainment series of the 20th and 21st century, the Buckyball Racing Club, sponsored by Leesti Azure Milk, presents the first part of a new galactic race, the Kessel Run.

The race runs from the 31st of October 3301, 00:00 GMT, to the 15th of November 3301, 23:59 GMT. It will begin at George Lucas station in Leesti and end in the Jabbah system, a few hundred light years outside the bubble. Between start and finish, participants must dock at every station and outpost named 'Kessel' in any order they desire.

There will be three racing classes: Regulation Solo Sidewinder, Regulation Solo Cobra Mk III, and the Open Unlimited Spec class.

* Federation Scientist Initiates Independent Research Programme
Ishmael Palin, the Federation scientist tasked with studying the anomalous extraterrestrial objects discovered earlier this year, has announced his decision to resume his research. This development follows the termination of an earlier, Federation-backed research programme led by Professor Palin.

The decision to restart the programme constitutes a defiant move on the part of Professor Palin, who declined to make a public statement at the time of the original project's cancellation. The new research effort will be based at Christian Dock in the Nganji System, close to the region of space where the objects were discovered.

Professor Palin made the following statement:

\I have no wish to speculate on Governor Quaid's reasons for cancelling the original research programme, but I will say that these objects signify a potentially momentous scientific discovery, and I am extremely pleased to be able to continue my research. As a scientist I feel it is my duty to subject these fascinating objects to comprehensive analysis, and to share the results of that analysis with the galactic community. Hopefully, now that Governor Deacon has allowed us to establish a research base at Christian Dock, my team and I can continue with our work, free from interference.\

* Empire Wins Decisive Victory
For the past two weeks, the Empire has been battling the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn in the Namarii, Tabaldak and LTT 874 systems. This morning, the Empire confirmed that the campaign had been a resounding success, resulting in the total destruction of all three Emperor's Dawn bases. Senator Denton Patreus, who has been leading the campaign against the insurrectionists, issued a defiant statement:

\Today we have delivered a decisive blow to our enemies, shattering their forces and leaving them scattered and defenceless. For all their bluster, these dissidents have been shown themselves to be nothing more than petty brigands, lacking in unity and moral conviction, and unable to withstand the might of our combined military forces. Their bases have been destroyed, their fleets routed. Emperor's Dawn is no longer a threat.\

But General Anthony Corvus, the veteran responsible for coordinating the Empire's military operations, adopted a more cautious tone:

\This is a significant victory, certainly, but the war is not over. Cell organisations such as Emperor's Dawn can be surprisingly resilient, and it would be a mistake to discount them, even at this stage. Once I have seen the very last of their fighters destroyed, I will consider them vanquished. But that day has not yet come.\


* Construction of New Starport Begins
Work has now begun on a new Ocellus starport in the Kaushpoos system. The project began with a request from the Explorers' Association, which issued an appeal for metals for use in the station superstructure. The response to the request was overwhelmingly positive, and work on the starport is now underway. A spokesperson for the Explorers' Association released a brief statement:

\We're delighted with the response, and are hugely excited about starting work on the starport. With a little luck, there will soon be a brand new, state-of-the art outpost in the Pleiades Nebula.\

The Explorers' Association is expected to announce the next phase of the project soon.


* Station Services Suspended at Gurragchaa Gateway
Following recent news of technical issues in the Warkushanui system, officials at Gurragchaa Gateway have announced that all station services, bar refuelling and rearming, have been suspended. A member of the starport's technical team released a brief statement:

\Due to ongoing technical issues, we are currently unable to offer access to the commodities market, shipyard and outfitting services, and other frontline facilities. We are still trying to determine the cause of the problem, and will notify the public as soon as services are reinstated. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.\

Shortly after this statement was released, a Federal source issued an official travel warning advising pilots to avoid the starport entirely.


* Garrison Supplies Found in Criminal Hands
Numerous civil wars have been fought between criminal groups and system governments throughout Imperial space over the past month, and corrupt governments and cartels have been overthrown in many instances. Investigations into the conflicts have uncovered disturbing connections, as many confiscated weapons and munitions bear serial numbers of garrison supplies stockpiled in the Guathiti system.

Evidence currently points to growing corruption in the Delta Doradus region. Disturbing correlations can be drawn between this lawless activity and the Kumo Crew's influence in systems they seek to overthrow. Imperial investigators have been despatched.

* Nascent Starport Targeted by Pirates
Last week, the Explorers' Association announced plans to construct a starport in the Pleiades Nebula, and issued an appeal for resources. The response to the request was positive and work on the station superstructure is now underway. With the project poised to enter its second phase, the Explorers' Association has issued another request, this time for assistance of a more practical kind:

\We were delighted with the response to our appeal, and are thrilled that our dream of building an Ocellus starport in the Pleiades Nebula is finally becoming a reality. Projects of this sort are bound to attract opportunists, however, and unfortunately ours is no exception. Pirates have begun congregating in the Kaushpoos system, preying on the traders and contractors travelling to and from the construction site. Fortunately, we anticipated such an eventuality, and set aside a cash reserve specifically for the reimbursement of bounty hunters. Experienced combat pilots are invited to come to the Kaushpoos system and help deal with these troublemakers. We are also in need of palladium for the next phase of the construction, so those who prefer trade to combat can also contribute to this exciting project.\

Pilots who want to participate in the operation are encouraged to travel to the Kaushpoos system.


* Jeffress's Second Treasure Hunt
Last month, the reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress made headlines with his galaxy-wide treasure hunt, and now it seems the eccentric billionaire is at it again. Having promised that the first event would not be the last of its kind, Jeffress has announced a second treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner.

According to a statement from Jeffress, the event will follow much the same format as the first. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will lead participants to the mystery object:

\A dissatisfied scholar keeps a visionary in his grasp as he makes his deal.\

With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.


* CIRG Researcher Addresses Artefact Developments
The Voice of Varati recently interviewed the lead researcher at the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, Commander RedWizzard:

\We know that the UA's Morse-transmission behaviour is evolving. It's almost as if somebody is pushing buttons to trigger different behaviours. It's very strange.

\We've also observed that they're spreading at an alarming rate over a huge volume of space. We learned a while ago that UAs seem to align themselves towards Merope in the Pleiades, and there is evidence that the systems containing UAs form a 'shell' around Merope at distances between 135 and 150 light years. Current estimates place the potential number of UAs in this region at thousands \u2013 possibly even tens of thousands.\

\This undeniable explosion in numbers is worrying, and we don't yet know its significance. But rest assured that we're working hard, and we hope to have some conclusions soon.\

RedWizzard also commented on the return of Professor Ishmael Palin to active UA research:

\It's great to see him back in the game, and we wish him the best of luck. We also hope he might have some insight into this 'shell' phenomenon. Why this pattern? Why so many UAs? And where are they coming from?\

\Our research is open to all, including Professor Palin. We hope he will reciprocate our openness.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Technical Issues in 64 Arietis
The starport of Weyn Dock in the 64 Arietis system has become the latest to be affected by mysterious technical issues, following a rash of inexplicable breakdowns and malfunctions at starports throughout the Warkushanui system. According to Laura Bishop, technical supervisor at Weyn Dock, the starport has experienced a range of problems over the past 24 hours:

\First we had some power outages, now we've got widespread system failures. We haven't been able to determine the cause but we're investigating at the moment, so when we know more, you'll know more.\


* GalNet Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections.

Here are 10 of the 3,210 minor factions holding elections:

BD-17 6172 Travel Industries

United LHS 3505 Liberals

Karsha Solutions

Traditional V749 Herculis Party

Kurundulli Empire League

Charonium Industry

Phiagre Industry

Walka Blue General Co

Kartam Silver Fortune Inc

HIP 13841 Purple Bridge PLC

Elections occur when two minor factions of a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.

* GalNet Weekly Expansion List
Each week, GalNet presents a list of 10 of the 5,088 minor factions currently expanding into new systems.

Niflhel Guardians of Tradition

BD+53 912 for Equality

Bast Holdings

Kraunaha Interstellar

Vanayequi Independents

Apalar Labour

Sicusha Gold General Services

Ngauna Incorporated

Dilgariang Confederacy

Lungundani PLC

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Trouble in Varati
Following reports of technical problems in the 64 Arietis and Warkushanui systems, news of similar problems at Bond Hub in the Varati system are beginning to emerge. Stana Chapple, an engineer at Bond Hub, confirmed that the starport was experiencing technical difficulties:

\Yeah, we've had a few system malfunctions and power failures \u2013 the same sort of problems the folks at Weyn Dock are dealing with. We haven't figured out the cause, but we're looking into it now. Still, the problems aren't too severe, so I'm optimistic we'll have things running smoothly soon.\


* Armed Intruders Apprehended at Christian Dock
Security personnel at Christian Dock in the Nganji System have successfully apprehended a group of armed interlopers, it has been confirmed. The intruders, who were reported to be in possession of personal weapons classed as illegal in several systems, are being detained while they await preliminary sentencing.

Jason Treeves, Head of Security at Christian Dock, had the following to say:

\The trespassers managed to disable our frontline security system, but apparently they didn't realise we had an array of secondary sensors, and they triggered the alarm. A response team was scrambled to their location, and my men succeeded in subduing the intruders with a minimum of fuss. A full investigation into how these men were able to bypass our security systems is now underway.\

Readers will no doubt recall that Christian Dock is also the centre of Professor Ishmael Palin's research into the unknown artefacts discovered earlier this year. Treeves refused to comment on a possible connection between the security breach and Professor Palin's research, but a civilian source at Christian Dock said:

\I have it on good authority they were caught trying to break into Palin's laboratory, and I heard they had incendiary explosives, too. I wouldn't be surprised to discover they were trying to destroy the lab and the UAs.\


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 8,296 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Alliance of Wolf 485a

Traditional CD-64 139 Flag

Revolutionary Party of Patosata\t

Ross 199 Silver Raiders

19 Leonis Min Alliance Combine

HIP 11433 Blue Cartel

Kebel Yeh Independents

LTT 198 Order

Olwain Liberals

Progressive Party of Nanabozho

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 2,532 minor factions in lockdown:

Butors Empire Pact

Movement for Ross 1051 Confederacy

Munfayl Labour\t

Anemoi Noblement

Dukes of Milcenu

Union of Njunmin Free

Law Party of MCC 858

LHS 3505 Services

Bureau of Bodb Dearg Flag

Kipsigines Vision Partners

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 2,657 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Autocracy of LTT 16764

Partnership of Skaoismont

G 69-11 Co-op

Workers of Skeggiko O Labour

El Tio Empire Party

Groombridge 1618 Inc

Jeterait Bridge Interstellar

Green Party of HIP 103138

Lumanans Confederacy

BPM 590 Creative Network

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Positive Response to Explorers' Association Request
The Explorers' Association has released a statement confirming that the pirates operating in the Kaushpoos system have been eliminated. Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's appeal, taking to their ships to battle the agitators disrupting the assembly of Kaushpoos's new Ocellus starport and deliver palladium for use in its construction. A spokesperson for the Explorers' Association released a brief statement:

\By coming to the aid of this important initiative, the galactic community has once again demonstrated its belief in the value of this starport. The Explorers' Association extends its sincere gratitude to all those who helped to rid the Kaushpoos system of pirates, and also to those who delivered palladium for the next phase of construction. Thanks to you, we can continue with our work.\

A further statement is expected from the Explorers' Association soon, announcing its third and final public appeal for resources.


* Cayutorme Syndicate Seeks Support
Imperial investigators have confirmed ties between Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew and the mercenary group known as the Cayutorme Syndicate. This partnership brings disturbing context to the civil unrest currently affecting Cayutorme, as well as the syndicate's rapid rise to power.

The leader of the Cayutorme Syndicate, Kyle Kurowski, is now trying to encourage mercenaries to join his already-imposing armada:

\It is no great surprise that the Empire would attempt to strong-arm an independent system within its territory. Our navy is capable of handling an Imperial task force, but we nevertheless would like to increase our numbers. Any independent pilots willing to help us repel the impending invasion will be compensated richly, and granted access to high-class outfitting.\

Commander Corrigendum


* Treasure Hunt Comes to an End
The treasure hunt organised by the billionaire and philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has come to an end, with a pilot by the name of Commander Woodhouse claiming victory. Hundreds of people took part in the competition, but ultimately there could only be one victor.

As with Jeffress's previous treasure hunt, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery objects at the centre of the search \u2013 a trio of time capsules. The clues took pilots first to Slipher Hub in the Faust 68 system, then to Dickensport in Fomalhaut, and finally to the Cernunnos system.

When the winner was announced, Alfred Jeffress released the following statement:

\I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the winner. You will receive your prizes soon! As for the other competitors, I would once again like to encourage them to remain hopeful \u2013 there will be another Jeffress treasure hunt, and next time the winner could be you!\


* Epsilon Indi Hosts Summit Conference
London Relay in the Epsilon Indi system is to host a summit conference focusing on terrorism and galactic security. Representatives from the Empire, the Federation and the Alliance are all expected to attend the three-day event, which begins next week. Topics for discussion are expected to include Emperor's Dawn and the ongoing conflict in the Pegasi Sector.

As preparations for the event begin, Federal authorities have raised concerns about an organisation based at London Relay known as 'Revolution Incorporated'. According to authorities, the group has announced its intention to commemorate the Gunpowder Plot \u2013 a historic incident dating from Earth's distant past \u2013 with \a special event\ due to coincide with the summit. Although the precise nature of the event has not been revealed, authorities are nevertheless uneasy:

\It's entirely possible that the organisation's intentions are benign, but since we know so little about it, and given its publicized intention to commemorate an attack on the state, we are obligated to investigate.\

The Federal spokesperson was asked to confirm reports that the group also plans to issue an open contract for explosives, but said only: \we can neither confirm nor deny such reports\.


* Sirius Corporation Programme Begins Today
Following a recent statement from Sirius Corporation announcing its intention to revitalise several newly acquired star systems, the company has launched an initiative to boost the economy of HIP 8396. At the heart of the initiative is a request for osmium, which Sirius Corp hopes will serve as a fillip for the system's financial rejuvenation. Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of the Sirius Corp., was quoted as saying:

\The people of HIP 8396 are part of the Sirius Corporation family, but if we are to help our compatriots, we will need help ourselves. So I implore all galactic citizens to contribute to this initiative, and bring a new era of peace and prosperity to HIP 8396.\


* Duelling Narratives in Cayutorme Conflict
The deadline for the inspection and disbandment of the mercenary Cayutorme Syndicate fleet has passed, and Imperial Naval vessels have entered the Cayutorme system. Speaking from an undisclosed location, the leader of the Cayutorme Syndicate, Kyle Kurowski, confirmed that his mercenary armada had engaged the Imperial Fleet, but denied reports that independent pilots were fighting for both sides: \Independent pilots are just that \u2013 independent. They will not be the tool the Emperor uses to turn us into Imperial citizens. If they stand for freedom, they stand with us.\

The Imperial war chest has been opened for any independent pilots who want to help the Imperial cause. Admiral Lucius Lavigny, the Emperor's second cousin, stated:

\We know that Commanders pledged to the Empire will fight to maintain law and order, and we urge other Commanders to do the same. If these miscreants are permitted to continue with their activities, more systems will suffer.\

* A Week in Powerplay
Zachary Hudson's approval rating reached unprecedented heights this week. Federal fleets secured four strategic systems, bringing the total number of Republican control systems to 75. These new bases of operation include G 250-34, UBV 15076, Aornum, and DP Camelopardalis. As the fleet continues to grow, spurred on by CQC recruitment drives, it is likely that even more systems will fall under the protection of the Federal Navy.

Edmund Mahon welcomed the people of BD+66 696 and 3 Upsilon Ophiuchi into the Alliance fold. The Prime Minister is busy with negotiations in the Sabikami system this week. Despite some minor setbacks, the Alliance economy remains strong.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval recovered from the recent dissatisfaction of seven disgruntled systems, and poured more garrison supplies than ever before into systems scattered throughout her domain. Though not every system received a full allocation, they still produced a substantial command capital reserve.

Li Yong-Rui led Sirius to another successful week. The acquisitions of HIP 14886 and Ticua helped to elevate the corporation's financial rating, and with substantial capital reserves even after the most recent acquisitions, Sirius is poised to continue its growth.

Felicia Winters led the Liberal party out of turmoil this week with a redoubling of Federal aid distribution. Lumbla's concerns were assuaged and the Xiriwal system pledged its support to Shadow President Winters. With a substantial reserve of command capital, the coming weeks will likely see even more systems join the Liberal party.

Aisling Duval's popularity index fell dramatically this week as she faced above-average opposition. Three systems have expressed dissatisfaction and announced a possible withdrawal of support to the People's Princess.

Zemina Torval's enterprises purchased controlling interests in Ac Yax Baru and He Pola this week. As long as funding remains available, there will be additional acquisitions during the coming week. Some acquisitions may prove to be bad investments for the senator's enterprises.

Denton Patreus balanced his budget almost perfectly for the second week in a row. This means the Senator has no opportunities to prepare or expand his influence into new territory. Instead, his fleets are freed up to fortify his territory or partake in offensive actions.

Archon Delaine crushed resistance from the system governments of Quikindji, Kui Xing, Bhattra, and Wikanawal in a massive surge of activity this week. Imperial fleets were overwhelmed, but managed to repulse the Kumo Crew from Imperial territory in Dhak and Bipera, while other freedom fighters protected Medzistha. With further insurrections already erupting, it looks like the Kumo Crew will establish more strongholds this week.

Pranav Antal's administration was faced with a difficult choice this week, as evidence of unacceptable behaviour was uncovered in seven enclave systems. Moral Enforcer Zaan addressed the issue in this statement: \Social malignancy will not be tolerated, and will be excised for the good of all who live within Utopia. Systems deemed irrevocably tainted will be divested from Utopian space, with virtuous citizens given safe passage to new homes in other Utopian communes.\

* Mavia Kain Announces Galactic Games
Mavia Kain, High Inquisitor of the Imperial Inquisition, has formally announced the upcoming Galactic Games for Charity. The games will take place between the 13th and 15th of November 3301 in support of the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation. A general amnesty will be declared in the Brestla system over the weekend.

The headline event is the Galactic 'Top Gun' Championship, in which pilots from across the galaxy will compete for a prize of 200 million credits. Commanders wishing to participate are invited to visit Roed Oodergaard Port in the Brestla system between 18.00 on Friday the 13th of November and 06.00 on Saturday the 14th of November. The final will be held on Sunday at 20.00.

The weekend will culminate with the first ever 'Elite Hunger Games', in which 24 commanders will compete in a no-holds-barred fight to the death in Mk III Vipers.

* Frontline Report: Cayutorme
Imperial forces have begun their offensive against the Cayutorme Syndicate and its illegal fleet. Large clashes have occurred over the past few days, and major victories have been won by the forces of the Imperial Navy and its auxiliary force of Commanders.

The Cayutorme Syndicate fleet has put up a good fight, but has been met with overwhelming force. At the time of writing the fight is in a bit of a lull, with only minor skirmishes going on, as the Syndicate begins to deploy reinforcements. If things continue as they have, the Syndicate fleet may have to surrender or face total destruction at the hands of the Imperial Navy.

* Order Restored to Cayutorme
After several days of fighting between Imperial forces and the mercenaries of the Cayutorme Syndicate, order has been restored to the Cayutorme system. With the mercenary fleet defeated, the leaders of the Cayutorme Syndicate have petitioned for a ceasefire. Kyle Kurowski, the leader of the organisation, has not been seen since hostilities began.

Speaking from Adkins Port, Admiral Lucius Lavigny praised the Commanders who fought for the Empire:

\This conflict would have lasted much longer without the support of independent Commanders of the Pilots Federation. The Empire thanks them for their efforts.\

Admiral Lavigny also announced that all captured mercenary vessels would be sold at Adkins Port in Cayutorme, at a heavy discount. Value-minded buyers are already gathering.

* Increased Smuggling Activity in Epsilon Indi
Authorities in the Epsilon Indi system have reported a dramatic increase in smuggling over the past week. Station personnel at London Relay \u2013 believed to be the focus of the smuggling activity \u2013 declined to provide specifics, but an anonymous source at the starport said:

\Apparently a group called 'Revolution Incorporated' put out a request for explosives, which is why there's been a spike. Of course, the station authorities don't want people to know the station is full of explosives, especially with the summit conference starting soon, but I gather the response to the request was pretty enthusiastic.\

The Federal Times approached Revolution Incorporated for a response to this statement, but received only a brief, cryptic reply:

\People have started to forget about old Guy and his friends. We think it's time someone reminded them.\


* Sirius Corporation Programme Begins Today

* Starport Project Enters Final Phase
Two weeks ago, the Explorers' Association began work on a new Ocellus starport in the Pleiades Nebula. The project received financial support from the Brewer Corporation and Universal Cartographics, which offered generous premiums to traders providing essential materials for the construction. Now, with the bulk of the work complete, the Explorer's Association has announced a third and final appeal for resources:

\Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the galactic community, the new Ocellus starport is almost complete, and we are a hair's breadth from gaining an important foothold in the Pleiades Nebula. All that's needed now is one final push. If you are in a position to help, we implore you to do so. This is your last chance to be a part of this historic project.\

Pilots who want to contribute to the campaign are invited to deliver Computer Components to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.

* A Week in Powerplay
Zachary Hudson secured expansions in three systems this week. AF Leporis, DP Camelopardalis, Kaushpoos, and Li Jungu all became bases for the Federation's fleets. AF Leporis has been a point of contention for many weeks due to its strategic location, and will provide a valuable staging point for future operations in the region.

Edmund Mahon welcomed Sabikami and Gui Banni into the Alliance's list of preferred trade partners after successful negotiations were concluded early Thursday morning. News of additional trade agreements is expected in a week's time.

Arissa Lavigny-Duval's Shield of Justice busily distributed garrison supplies to her control systems, ensuring a comfortable command capital reserve for further expansion of Imperial justice. No new systems were added to the Emperor's list of protected systems this week.

Felicia Winters focused primarily on distributing aid packages to systems in need this week. There were no additional systems that pledged their support to the Liberal party, but 41 Lambda Hydrae, Elycoch, and HIP 38747 are currently prime candidates for future Liberal strongholds.

Li Yong-Rui added MET 20 to the Sirius portfolio this week. The coming week brings the promise of potential acquisitions in the T'ien Mu and Dhak systems. Some concern has been expressed about the profitability of recent and future acquisitions, but markets are still trading Sirius stock at a premium.

Aisling Duval experienced both the loss of HIP 116045 and the acquisition of HIP 3603 during the past week, leaving the count of systems in support of the People's Princess at sixty-one. Aisling now enjoys a modest reserve that will allow her to gain favor in at least one more system in the near future.

Zemina Torval acquired controlling assets in Kalana during the past week, increasing the number of systems in her portfolio to fifty-three. Negotiations are currently underway for a potential acquisition of HIP 107936, a system which may prove to be another bad acquisition for the senator's enterprises.

Denton Patreus is running a deficit resulting from last week's high administrative costs that could not be offset by sufficient funds and supplies delivered to local security forces.The size of Patreus' territory is clearly too large for the senator to sustain long-term.

Archon Delaine secured a new stronghold in 10 Kappa Pegasi this week, but Kumo Crew sponsored insurrections in Yu Di Yi and VVO 19 were suppressed. Yuror, an Imperial system near Senator Patreus' territory, appears to be the Pirate Lord's focus this week.

Pranav Antal severed ties with Ahemez, Cao Yankir, HR 17, Kaurukat, Minerva, Takurua, and Xi Wang Mu this week. This purge of enclave systems was the first since Utopia's founding. The burden laid upon Utopian administrators is reportedly lighter this week, and optimism in Polevnic is running high.

According to Money Matters correspondent Roberta Unwin:

\The market value of a commodity can increase over time, of course, but dramatic spikes of this sort tend not to happen without a catalyst. Evidently, someone is paying a great deal for these objects. The question is: who?\

Here are 10 of the 7,434 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Nanter Company

United Ao Progressive Party

Shokwakw Future

LP 167-71 PLC

Wolf 54 Crimson Cartel

Manianscudo Energy Group

Social Wolf 333 Liberals

Blue Transport Exchange

Partnership of HIP 97567

Zeaex Flag

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,893 minor factions in lockdown:

Vash Domain

Lovedu Blue Major Inc

Kratakak Group

Cailli Purple Electronics Org

Polecteri Justice Party

League of Cybele

Giltine Network\t

Partnership of LTT 9315

Bacap Nobles

Tegidana Liberty Party

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,767 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

NLTT 5871 Shared

Huiche Future

Traditional LTT 7330 League

LHS 2150 Purple Electronics Serv

Kareco Crimson Mob

Paesi Empire Consulate

Independent Raniyan for Equality

Aitvara Industry

League of Turbacobo Conservatives

Cartel of Alacagui

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Explorers' Association Appeal Successful
The Explorers' Association has announced that the third stage of its ambitious starport project is complete. The materials needed for the final phase of construction have been delivered, and the finishing touches are now being applied to the Kaushpoos system's new Ocellus starport. A spokesperson for the Explorers' Association expressed satisfaction with the result, but stressed that the starport was not yet open for business:

 \I want to take this opportunity to thank the many hundreds of independent pilots who supported this project, and helped make our dream a reality. There's still work to do, but we're on schedule to officially open the starport next month. We look forward to seeing you at the opening ceremony!\

In keeping with the public-spirited nature of the project, the name of the starport was decided by public vote. The result was 'Obsidian Orbital'.


* Sirius Corporation Programme Ends Today
Last week, the Sirius Corporation launched an initiative to boost the economy of the HIP 8396 system, which was recently brought under its control. The initiative was underpinned by an open contract for osmium, which contractors were asked to deliver to Stepping Stone Base. The response to the appeal was positive, with hundreds of miners taking to their ships to gather resources for the people of HIP 8396. Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of Sirius Corp., expressed his satisfaction at the response:

\The pilots who contributed to this initiative have performed a great service, and proved that the people of this galaxy are motivated as much by altruism as by the promise of reward. We are all humanitarians at heart.\

It is expected that the Sirius Corporation will announce the next initiative in its multi-system revitalisation programme soon.


* Onionhead Appeal Attracts Pirates
Reports coming in from the Xelabara system indicate that the recent request from the Drug Empire of Xelabara for onionhead has drawn hundreds of pirates to the system. According to system authorities, the pirates are targeting the traders travelling to and from Navigator Market, the hub of the onionhead operation. Fortunately, the Xelabara Republic Party has promised to reward pilots who help eliminate the pirates. A spokesperson for the Xelabara Republic Party said:

\We suspected the increase in trade activity would attract pirates, so we set aside some privateer bonds for combat pilots to help clear the spaceways. So if you own a combat ship and you know how to use it, get yourself over to Xelabara. We need you!\


* Faction Issues Appeal for Onionhead
A faction known as the Drug Empire of Xelabara has issued a request for the controversial narcotic onionhead. The drug was once a significant trade commodity, but it suffered a setback last year when former Federal President Jasmina Halsey declared it illegal in Federal space. Rooney 'Rush' Romero, a spokesperson for the Drug Empire of Xelabara, explained that the appeal is partly intended to revitalise the market:

\The fact is that people want onionhead. The Federation might not like it, but that's their problem \u2013 our organisation is well within its rights to establish a trading operation in Xelabara. Trouble is, although we've got the money, we don't have the merchandise. That's why we're offering generous incentives to pilots who deliver onionhead to our base of operations in Xelabara.\

The Drug Empire of Xelabara is not believed to be connected to the Farmer's Cooperative of the Kappa Fornacis system, onionhead's main producer. The Federation has not released an official statement concerning the request.


* More Malfunction Reports
Over the past month, starports in the Warkushanui, 49 Arietis, 64 Arietis and Varati systems have experienced a raft of mysterious technical issues and malfunctions. Gurragchaa Gateway in Warkushanui has been the worst affected, and at the time of writing the station remains in a state of partial closure.

As the problems persist, reports of similar \u2013 and equally mysterious \u2013 issues have arrived from Hinz Hub in the Ngobe system, Tsunenaga Dock in the Iapodes system, and Li Qing Jao in Sol. Precise details are not available, but the problems are understood to be similar to those plaguing Warkushanui, 49 Arietis, 64 Arietis and Varati.

All starports in the affected systems are believed to be fully operational, but if the issues are not addressed soon, closures may be inevitable.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* A Week in Powerplay
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval deflected a great deal of opposition in her territory this week, and extended the services of the Shield of Justice to six new systems. Bragit, HR 4720, Juipedi, Kappa, Olelbis, and Tujil were all swept free of criminal activity, and regular patrols were established. Contie, Mbutsi, and NLTT 7856 are the focus of active crime sweeps this week.

Federal President Zachary Hudson established a new base for the Federal fleet in the Picunche system this week, edging the number of bases operated by the Republican party to 79. If all goes well for the Federation President this week, eight additional bases will be opened \u2013 a testament to the rapid growth of the Federal Navy.

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is currently presiding over a contracting economy, facing the lowest economic rating in nearly three months. Despite the slowing of commerce, the Tikurua system has formalized trade agreements with the Alliance, and now falls under the protection of the Council of Admirals.

Shadow President Felicia Winters secured the support of 41 Lambda Hydrae and HIP 38747 this week, amid some mild controversy. The Shadow President now looks to Kherthaje and Catun for additional support. In an odd turn of events, the Mbutsi system deep in the heart of Winters' territory appears to be courting Imperial favour. Shadow President Winters is reportedly engaged in talks with the local system leaders in an attempt to secure their loyalty.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui finalized a deal to purchase controlling interests in T'ien Mu this week. Economists have expressed concerns about the profitability of future acquisitions, but support for Li Yong-Rui's vision for the future of Sirius remains strong. Sirius now controls 60 key systems.

Senator Aisling Duval maintained the status quo this week \u2013 a rarity in the fast-paced world of politics and public opinion. The People's Princess is currently attempting to curry favour with the people of HIP 116045, and has reportedly been warmly received in the system.

Senator Zemina Torval has finalized contracts that brought the infrastructure of HIP 107936 into her portfolio. Next week, the senator's list of new acquisitions could include Yimanbin. Should this system become a part of her enterprise, her influence will encompass 55 systems.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine humiliated the Imperial expeditionary forces this week by overthrowing the Imperial system of Yuror. Captured Yurorian leaders were put to the sword and their families were paraded through Harma in shackles. A thinly veiled threat was broadcast to the Empire following the conquest of Yuror: \A person only has the rights they can hold on to\.

Utopian Leader Pranav Antal has led his people to prosperity following previous weeks of turmoil. A vastly reduced administrative burden has made it possible for Utopia to amass resources sufficient to ensure the vision of Utopia will spread once more through civilized space.

Senator Denton Patreus finds himself in dire straits this week. Nearly a year of his popular zero-taxation policy, combined with months of combined pressure from Emperor's Dawn and the advances of the Kumo Crew, have worn down the Senator's fleets. The senator's forces have withdrawn from Utgaroar, and may soon withdraw from 47 Ceti.

* Onionhead Appeal Successful
The Drug Empire of Xelabara has announced that its appeal for onionhead has been successful. According to Rooney 'Rush' Romero, a spokesperson for the Drug Empire of Xelabara, the faction has received significant quantities of the controversial narcotic over the past week:

\This just goes to show that the demand for onionhead is a strong as ever, despite the Federation's attempts to quash it. I want to say a big thank you to all the traders who made the journey to Xelabara, and to all the pilots who helped clear the pirates from our spaceways. You guys rock!\

Romero announced that all those who contributed to the appeal could collect their rewards from Navigator Market in Xelabara.


* Services Suspended at Gaiman Dock and Weyn Dock
Authorities in the 64 Arietis system have confirmed that station services at Weyn Dock have been suspended due to ongoing technical issues at the starport. The announcement came within an hour of a similar statement from 49 Arietis, where it was confirmed that station services had also been suspended at Gaiman Dock. Shipyards at both starports are still understood to be accessible.

Meanwhile, the Arawere system has become the latest to be affected by the mysterious malfunctions, with Korolyov Hub experiencing similar issues to those plaguing starports in Warkushanui, 49 Arietis, 64 Arietis, Varati, Ngobe, Iapodes and Sol.

Technical teams at the affected starports are working around the clock to determine the cause of the malfunctions, and scientists across the galaxy, including those of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, are desperately trying to find a solution to the problem, but so far no progress has been made.


* Master Chefs Coming to Market
Last month, a remarkable story emerged from the Noti system. According to an anonymous report, an organisation known as the Revolutionary Noti Values Party had created a new strain of slave labour known as 'the Master Chefs'. The unidentified whistleblower claimed the slaves were subjected to an intensive training programme designed to transform them into the galaxy's greatest gourmets \u2013 a claim dismissed by many as an imaginative hoax. A subsequent report from the Federal Times of a Master Chef training facility at Weber Gateway went some way towards lending credibility to the story, but most people remained unconvinced.

The sceptics were proved wrong, however, when the Revolutionary Noti Values Party announced that not only were the Master Chefs real, they would soon be available for purchase. The announcement invoked the ire of human rights activists, who condemned the allegedly inhuman practices employed in training the Master Chefs. But this did little to deter consumers from placing advance orders for the epicurean slaves.

Now, the Revolutionary Noti Values Party has announced that it intends to further improve the efficacy of its gastronomic labourers by implanting a comprehensive compendium of culinary knowledge directly into their cerebellums. A spokesperson for the organisation said:

\By embedding this knowledge directly in a slave's brain, we can ensure total data integration and retention, which when combined with the slave's inherent culinary ability will result in unmatched gastronomic efficacy. These guys will be able to make a bacon sandwich fit for a king.\

The Revolutionary Noti Values Party concluded its announcement with a public appeal for Xihe Companions, which it will combine with the latest holographic technology to create the implants. The group has promised to give generous rewards to pilots who deliver the necessary materials.


* CIRG Sends Scientists to Bond Hub
Mere hours after the Canonn Interstellar Research Group defeated the Labour of Varati in the recent Bond Hub election, more than fifty CIRG scientists arrived at Bond Hub from Thompson Dock. The scientists were accompanied by tonnes of equipment, which has been installed in makeshift labs. Professor D Luffy, lead scientist for the team, explained what was happening:

\First, we thank the residents of Bond Hub for calling for this election, voting for us, and allowing us to continue our work on the Unknown Artefacts. We have pledged to investigate the station malfunctions that have dominated the news in recent weeks, and since Bond is also affected we have an opportunity to put it at the heart of our research.\

\Our teams have started monitoring the malfunctions side-by-side with UAs brought from the Merope shell, so we can determine the exact nature of the UAs' relationship to these malfunctions.\

* Rescue Ships to be Given Bold New Livery
A joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and the Fuel Rats has resulted in a distinctive new colour scheme for search-and-rescue vessels. The livery has been designed to assist with the instant recognition of friendly rescue ships, thereby minimising unintentional attacks and soothing the nerves of those in need of rescue.

The unique colour scheme was created by a member of the Fuel Rats Mischief, an auxiliary of the celebrated volunteer-run rescue service. The designer, who goes by the name of Commander Father Cool, originally intended the livery to be used by the Fuel Rats, but ultimately the Pilots Federation decided it would be more suitable as a colour scheme for dedicated search-and-rescue vessels.

The new paint scheme will soon be seen on search-and-rescue ships throughout inhabited space.


* The Canonn Calls for Halt to Artefact Sales
The Voice of Varati today received a statement from Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group:

\As news of further station malfunctions spreads, I urge all those who have been selling Unknown Artefacts to stop doing so immediately, to avoid any further station shutdowns.\

\There is a strong positive correlation between the stations experiencing faults and the sale of UAs at those stations. Our own observations at Bond Hub in Varati support this: the artefacts appear to affect stations in the same way they affect ships, with potentially disastrous consequences.\

\Given these findings, we are deeply troubled by the surge in value of UAs across the black market, which clearly led to this increase in sales. Who caused this increase? Did they know the effect it would have?\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* A Week in Powerplay
Federal President Zachary Hudson resolved problems in his supply chain this week, and ensured the Federal Navy's bases received sufficient supplies. An increase in naval funding has also come through, which will soon allow the Federal Navy to establish a presence in new systems. The Emperor's Dawn cell discovered in Kausalya, less than 50 light years from Sol, will surely face heavy Federal opposition this week.

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has calmed concerns about a potential collapse in financial markets that struck both Sirius Gov and Torval's enterprises. Though trade has been impacted, with no new trade agreements secured during the past week, the Alliance's economic future appears stable at this time.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval oversaw a tremendous fortification effort this week, protecting a substantial command capital reserve for future use. Shield of Justice patrols were not established in any new systems, but given the current surplus of resources, new systems will likely be able to subscribe to the security service in coming weeks.

Shadow President Felicia Winters had a relatively quiet week. A great deal of effort was poured into preparing the way for potential extensions of the Liberal party's holdings, and the Shadow President now looks to bring Kherthaje, HIP 47328, and Amuzgo into the Liberal fold.

Princess Aisling Duval is currently dealing with the potential withdrawal of support from Woyo Mina and Kanuket. Leaders in both systems have allegedly rejected the Princess's closely held values. It is unclear at this time whether Aisling will respond publicly to the news.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui led the corporation through what appeared to be a normal week, but difficulty in financial markets has led to a troubling deficit in Sirius's budget, causing three systems in the portfolio to fall into a state of turmoil. If Sirius is able to return to a state of solvency, the acquisition of Dheneb will go ahead as planned this week.

Senator Zemina Torval was similarly affected by financial trouble this week. The senator's enterprises have become heavily laden with systems that simply do not turn a profit. For Torval to succeed in the future, she will need to divest herself of many of these deficit-causing systems.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's horde overwhelmed the beleaguered defence forces in Dhak following the third attempt to conquer the system. The Kumo Crew appears to be gaining momentum and crushing Imperial opposition. It is believed that Archon Delaine now has a vast reserve of command capital, with which he could easily establish additional strongholds in weeks to come.

Senator Denton Patreus balanced his budget by a narrow margin, as opposition to his goals reached levels that have not been seen for over ten weeks. Despite this, fortifications held against incursions into the senator's territory, making further cutbacks unnecessary for the time being.

Simguru Pranav Antal led a monumental effort to extend Utopia this week, but this Utopian outreach was sharply opposed, sending one Utopian system into a state of turmoil. Contie, a system over 150 light years from Polevnic, and Medzistha, a system nearly 140 light years from Polevnic, are entertaining Utopian representatives this week.

* Gutamaya Shipyards Announces the Imperial Fighter
In September, Gutamaya Shipyards released a new version of the enduringly popular Eagle. This month, the company has announced the launch of a new fighter designed specifically for the CQC Championship \u2013 the Imperial Fighter. Gutamaya has said that the small, manoeuvrable vessel will be ideally suited to close-quarters dogfights, and more than capable of going toe-to-toe with other CQC fighters.

As befits a ship created with the CQC Championship in mind, the Imperial Fighter offers a delicate balance of defence, firepower and manoeuvrability. The ship is more agile than the F63 Condor, which offers a similar spread of features, although it lacks the Condor's speed and hull strength. In terms of firepower, the Imperial Fighter matches the Condor with two small hardpoints.

The Imperial Fighter's specifications are not the only important factor, however. According the ship's designer, Pascal Roux, the vessel was created as a tribute to the late Emperor, Hengist Duval. In an interview with the Imperial Herald, Roux said: \What I admired most about the Emperor was his balance of elegance and strength, and the fighter represents my attempt to reflect those qualities.\

The Imperial Fighter is due to be released for use in the CQC Championships in December, and will go on general sale in early 3302.


* Explorer's Association \Delighted\ with Response to Appeal
The Explorer's Association has announced that its request for exploration data has been positively received by the galactic community. Over the past two weeks, the organisation has accepted a wealth of information on previously uncharted star systems, which it will now sell to various private clients. A spokesperson for the association issued a brief statement:

\We are delighted with the response to our appeal, and would like to thank all those who participated in the initiative. The significance of your contribution to our ever-increasing understanding of the galaxy cannot be overstated.\


* A Week in Powerplay
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon finalized trade agreements with the HIP 80243 and Marralteki systems this week, defying economic downtrends seen elsewhere in populated space. Benanekpeno is the latest system to curry favour with the Alliance and attempt to join the list of preferred trade partners.

President Zachary Hudson did not establish any new bases this week, instead focussing his efforts on strengthening supply lines to existing bases in his jurisdiction. But the growing Federal fleet is seeking new berths in Dhanchu, HIP 44811, and Wolf 287. If these systems become fully operational Federal bases, President Hudson's domain will extend to 82 bases in total.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's domain was relatively peaceful this week, as shield of Justice patrols kept her territory safe. The Emperor has a busy week ahead of her, as six new systems - Gitse, HIP 21991, LTT 1345, Mbutsi, Neites, and Paucates - have requested the protection of her fleets. If these systems join her cause, the Emperor will hold sway over 83 key systems by the end of the week.

Shadow President Felicia Winters witnessed a surge in opposition this week, but successfully thwarted the challenges with minimal effort. Codorain and Shenggan are currently accepting liberal aid packages, and will likely join the Shadow President's cause within the week.

Princess Aisling Duval's representatives concluded negotiations with the leaders of Woyo Mina and Kanuket without a consensus being reached. The two systems have formally withdrawn their support from the People's Princess, and the leaders of the Duryampas system have also told Aisling's representatives that they intend to withdraw their support.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui sold off assets in Tote, GCRV 2743, and NLTT 6655 this week, attempting to hedge against a potential galactic recession. Unfortunately, the economic situation has worsened, and the corporation is facing another week of potential losses. Li Yong-Rui is currently weighing options, and considering divesting additional systems.

Senator Denton Patreus's fleets countered a surge in enemy activity on the fringes of his territory, nearly setting a record for the distribution of garrison supplies. But despite these efforts, the system of Contiku was left open to attack, and was plunged into turmoil early Thursday morning.

Senator Zemina Torval's enterprises continue to struggle with the economic crisis, but the sale of Junga's infrastructure enabled Torval to balance her budget this week. With a galactic recession looming, it may become necessary for Torval to divest herself of additional systems to remain profitable.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine was repulsed from the remote Alchera system this week, but several new Kumo-sponsored insurrections have emerged. Four Imperial systems \u2013 Inmutha, Itzamnets, Kenna and LTT 874 - have been targeted by the Kumo Crew, and with the Imperial Expeditionary Force still reeling from recent defeats, many question whether system defences will hold.

Simguru Pranav Antal was unsuccessful in opening new enclaves this week, although Utopia currently has the resources to bring several new systems into the fold. Utopian representatives are being sent far and wide in an attempt to extend Utopia's influence throughout inhabited space.

* Technical Issues spread to Harma and Wolf 1301
Authorities at Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system have reported that the station is the latest to be affected by mystifying technical problems, following a raft of malfunctions and breakdowns throughout the starport. Meanwhile, personnel at Saunders's Dive in Wolf 1301 have released a similar statement, reporting extensive technical problems over the past 24 hours. A member of the technical team at Saunders's Dive said:

\It's the same story as at those other starports \u2013 system failures, blackouts, all that stuff. At this rate, half the starports in the galaxy are going to be out of order before long. Someone needs to figure out what the hell is going on, and fast!\

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.


* A Week in Powerplay: Corrections
Gabriel Vox, chairman of the GalNet Board of Review, has released a statement in response to criticism of errors in recent GalNet publications:

\The GalNet periodical 'A Week in Powerplay' summarises weekly changes in political dynamics, economics and various other situations in thousands of systems throughout inhabited space. With this task comes a high probability of clerical error. It is my dubious honour to correct some of these errors at this time.\

\The summary of 22nd\u201328th October 3301 incorrectly stated that the Alliance forged no new trade agreements, when in fact an agreement with Kpaniya was finalized.\

\The summary of 3rd\u20139th December 3301 failed to mention the trade agreement between the Alliance and 37 Librae.\

\Princess Aisling Duval has erroneously been referred to as a 'senator' in several publications.\

\Please be assured that we will redouble our efforts to ensure the facts represented in 'A Week in Powerplay' are reliable.\

Commander Corrigendum


* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 10,244 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Justice Party of Caill Reddi

Cauan Tzu Stakeholders

Dominion of Zorya Nong

Kurichchan Coalition

HIP 87679 Purple Creative Org

Furuhjelm III-674 Republic Party\t

Regina Blue General Corporation

People's Bibri Labour

Carthage Silver Drug Empire

CD-68 29 General Organisation

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 1,509 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

Korovii Purple Comms Limited

Defence Force of Giryampi

Baker Confederacy

Uru Bureau

Hirapa Blue Camorra

People's Party of Asoorajara

Nobles of Lacaille 9352

Bureau of Zeta Aquilae

Green Party of Diso

Bhritzameno Regulatory State

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,969 minor factions in lockdown:

Ammatis Values Party

League of Mannona

Purple Netcoms Industries

Matlehi Democrats

Blue Universal Company

LTT 10462 Crew\t

Sietae Federal Corp

People's Haithis Green Party

HIP 10492 Future

Defence Party of Pastara

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,740 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Independent Kiliwatsuki Free

Partnership of Hu Jung

Values Party of Lalande 38451

Arne Naom Galactic Industry

LTT 6278 Camorra

New Wathiparian Progressive Party

Rhibo Purple Syndicate

Grabrigpa Industry

Wolf 620 Legal Incorporated

HIP 7817 Crimson Rats

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Federation Triumphs over Emperor's Dawn
When an outpost belonging to the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn was discovered in the Federal system of Kausalya two weeks ago, Federal President Zachary Hudson's response was swift and unequivocal. Promising to \mete out such punishment that the very fires of hell will seem but guttering candles in comparison,\ Hudson promptly despatched a military fleet to Kausalya. Today, Admiral Kirby of the Federal Navy confirmed that the initiative to rout the dissidents had been an unmitigated success:

\They were defiant at first, but the battle started to go our way pretty quickly, and the past week has just been a mopping-up exercise, really. I think the Federal Navy Auxiliary made a big difference \u2013 when the insurgents saw how many independent pilots we had on our side, their morale took a big hit.\

In a statement, Zachary Hudson exhibited his usual confidence:

\The insurgents' incursion into Kausalya was clearly the last gasp of a dying animal. They stood no chance against our fleet, and their outpost has been utterly destroyed. I predict this is the last we will see of Emperor's Dawn.\


* Fake Gem Scam Discovered
Word has reached this reporter over the past few hours of a massive fraud involving fake precious gems originating from the region of the Prism system. A security services spokesperson admitted that they had been caught unawares by the scale of the issue, and that thousands of fakes had already been sold:

\We will hunt down the perpetrators of these crimes, which have cost the system economy millions of credits.\

Efforts are now underway to locate the source of these convincing fakes and put an end to their trade. The spokesperson promised that those dealing in these fake gems would be punished to the full extent of the law.


* Faction Issues Festive Request
Despite sharing a standard galactic calendar, most human societies prefer to mark the passage of days and years in relation to the stars of their home systems. But a large proportion of the galaxy's human population still observe some shared traditions, despite those traditions being rooted in the seasons of a planet many have never even visited. Of these, winter solstice festivals are perhaps the most prevalent.

This year, an organisation based in the Hel system is issuing a special appeal to commemorate the approaching winter solstice. The Hel Purple Energy Industry has issued a request for Crystalline Spheres \u2013 a commodity currently available only at Snow Moon in the Bento system. A spokesperson for the Hel Purple Energy Industry issued a brief statement:

\It might be an antiquated festival, but we believe the winter solstice is a great opportunity to unwind and spend some quality time with friends and family. And what better way to mark the occasion than to invite people to gather up snowballs \u2013 I mean, crystalline spheres \u2013 and haul them across the galaxy?\

The appeal begins today and is scheduled to run for one week.


* Another Jeffress Treasure Hunt
Eccentric billionaire Alfred Jeffress has made headlines in recent weeks with not one but two galaxy-wide treasure hunts, each of which saw the reclusive philanthropist give out enormous cash prizes. Now Jeffress has announced a third treasure hunt, and once again he has promised to reward the winner with a share of his vast personal fortune.

The event is expected to follow the same format as the previous two. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, the hunt begins with a riddle, composed by Jeffress, which will lead participants to the mystery object:

\To win the prize, follow a story of kings, crowns and jewels, not tall tales told by fools. Your quest to restore the king's crown starts in the middle. Travel where all frequencies of light reside to start solving my riddle.\

Jeffress has promised that this hunt will be the most challenging yet, having devised even more cryptic clues this time.

* The Canonn Supports Palin's Effort
Professor Ishmael Palin has requested help in establishing a new research base on Maia B1BA in order to safely study the unknown artefacts. Dr Arcanonn, head of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has issued a statement regarding this endeavour:

\I cannot argue with the logic of establishing a research facility out in the Pleiades, next door to Merope, and I urge all Commanders to deliver as many Evacuation Shelters as they can to Nelson Works in Dahan to ensure this facility is completed.\

\With the Canonn throwing its resources at this initiative, I will be contacting the professor personally to request laboratory space for my researchers so that we, too, can be involved once the base is established.\

\Research into the UAs is not a side project for humanity - it is vital. Make sure you're one of those making a difference.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Technical Issues Spread to Maia
Following last week's report that the technical issues currently plaguing the galaxy had spread to Gabriel Enterprise in Harma, authorities at the starport have announced that all services have been suspended apart from docking and shipyard access. Meanwhile, authorities in the Maia system have confirmed that the starport of Obsidian Orbital is the latest to experience mysterious technical issues. This announcement will no doubt disappoint those who contributed to the construction of Obsidian Orbital earlier this year.

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.

* The Search for the Antares
3251 is remembered chiefly for the disappearance of the Antares, a technologically revolutionary passenger liner designed and built by the Sirius Corporation. The ship was supposed to usher in a new age in interplanetary travel, but the loss of the vessel during its maiden voyage tarnished the reputation of the Sirius Corporation and stalled the company's plans to develop further superfast liners.

The exact reason for the ship's disappearance has never been established, but a fragmentary status report, transmitted by the Antares moments before contact was lost, indicated that a component failure took place during the ship's first hyperspace jump. The failure resulted in a simultaneous explosion and mis-jump, leading many to assume that the ship had been destroyed. But no wreckage from the vessel has ever been found, and its precise fate remains unknown.

It seems, however, that the Sirius Corporation is not ready to close the file on the Antares. Today, Li Yong-Rui, CEO of the company's governmental division, announced that the organisation intends to launch an official search for the ship:

\Since the Antares was lost 50 years ago, there have been great advances in scanning technology, and we believe it may now be possible to find the remains of the ship. We are inviting every pilot in the galaxy to deliver wreckage components to our research base at Davy Dock in the Procyon system. Once we have accumulated enough material, we will subject the debris to comprehensive analysis to determine its origin. With luck, not only will we find the remains of the Antares, we will be able to determine her fate.\

The search begins today.

* Clauss Incorporated Issues Appeal
The Clauss Incorporated organisation, a galaxy-wide distributor of luxury commodities, has issued a public appeal for Special Gifts. The company CEO, Nicolas St Clauss, has released a statement to the media, which is reprinted in full below:

\We at Clauss Incorporated specialise in bringing joy to the people of this vast and wonderful galaxy. But fulfilling the hopes and dreams of so many is a difficult task, and this year we're experiencing increased demand for Special Gifts. So we're asking all you talented pilots to help us by transporting Special Gifts from Frost Dock in the Njambalba system to Clauss Port in the Santa Muerte system. We're willing to offer generous financial incentives to those who help, and we'll even be giving new ships to novice pilots who contribute to our appeal*.\

\Sincerely,

Nicolas St Clauss\

\*Terms and conditions: New ships will only be offered to pilots who have logged between 3 and 10 hours total flight time. The type of ship offered will depend on the total number of Special Gifts brought to Clauss Port, so please dig deep for your fellow pilots!\


* Scientist's Appeal Successful
Last week, Professor Ishmael Palin issued a request for evacuation shelters with which to establish a new research outpost on Maia b1ba in the Maia system. Today, Professor Palin announced that the request had been positively received by the galactic community, and that he and his team were now in a position to start work on their new base of operations.

\Given the strong correlation between the presence of Unknown Artefacts and the mechanical issues currently affecting starports, it's of the utmost importance that we continue our research at a remove from the civilian population,\ said Professor Palin. \This new outpost will allow us to do exactly that, and it couldn't have been achieved without the support of the public.\

Professor Palin said he hoped the new station would be up and running within a week.


* Treasure Hunt Comes to an End
The third treasure hunt from eccentric billionaire Alfred Jeffress has come to an unexpected end, with not one but two pilots claiming the grand prize. Commanders MAX RED and Sync Mercy completed the treasure hunt within seconds of each other, prompting Jeffress to declare them both winners.

As with Jeffress's previous treasure hunts, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery object at the centre of the search. Competitors were led to multiple systems, eventually landing at Lasswitz Terminal in the Mentor system, and finally to the Prism system where the mysterious object was found.

When the winners were announced, Alfred Jeffress released a brief statement:

\I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the winners, both of whom will soon receive a share of my personal fortune and the deeds to a new ship. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all those who took part \u2013 your enthusiasm has made this endeavour more than worthwhile.\


* Appeal for Crystalline Spheres Comes to an End
Last week, the Hel Purple Energy Industry launched a public appeal for crystalline spheres to commemorate the upcoming winter solstice festival \u2013 a tradition from Earth's ancient past. Hundreds of independent pilots got into the spirit of the occasion, taking to their ships to deliver the requested commodities to Snow Moon in the Bento system. A spokesperson for the Hel Purple Energy Industry said:

\We're thrilled with how it's turned out, we really are. Some said this appeal didn't have a chance of succeeding, but the response from the galactic community shows that the winter solstice still means something to people. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to check on the turkey.\

* Faction Appeals for Fireworks
With the end of the year less than a week away, preparations for New Year celebrations are in full swing throughout the galaxy. One of the most notable is the forthcoming party from Independent Cherets Labour, an organisation based in the Cherets system. According to a recent press release, the organisation has issued an open contract for fireworks with which to mark the start of 3302. But not just any fireworks. Anduliga fireworks.

\If you really want to start the New Year with a bang, you need fireworks. But I'm not talking about those namby-pamby firecrackers you get in Alioth or Achenar. I'm talking about the bone-rattling, teeth-loosening explosives you find in Anduliga. That's why we're offering rewards to anyone who brings Anduliga Fireworks to us here at Buckey Hub.\

Independent Cherets Labour has also asked for combat pilots to clear the spaceways of Cherets, to ensure the safety of those delivering fireworks to Buckey Hub. \Anyone who hands in bounty vouchers will be generously compensated,\ the organisation confirmed.

The appeal begins today and is scheduled to run until the 7th of January.


* Sirius Corporation Begins Analysing Wreckage
Last week, the Sirius Corporation launched a search for the remains of the Antares, an innovative passenger liner that disappeared during its maiden voyage in 3251.

Today, the Sirius Corporation confirmed that it has received thousands of tonnes of space-borne debris, and that it would soon begin analysing the wreckage to determine its origin. Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Gov, released a brief statement to the media:

\The galactic community has responded to our appeal with great enthusiasm, and we are extremely grateful to all those who took part in the search. Now we must analyse the debris to determine whether any of the wreckage delivered to us is from the Antares. We will make a further announcement as soon as our analysis is complete. Our hope is that the fate of the Antares will not remain a mystery much longer.\

* Diamond Frogs Contribute to Christmas Initiative
Over the past few days, private military contractors the Diamond Frogs have been hard at work on Operation: Mistle Toad, a concentrated effort to deliver personal gifts to the Santa Muerte system. A notable highlight of the campaign came when DF Commander Doot stopped by in an Imperial Cutter packed to the gills with 704 tonnes of personal gifts...twice!

Just a day before the planned close of the event, the combined efforts of the Diamond Frogs and other pilots resulted in a final tally of 250,000 tonnes of personal gifts. Moreover, the event organisers announced they have launched an initiative to give new members of the Pilots Federation a brand-new Faulcon DeLacey Viper Mk IV. This is in addition to a substantial cash reward for those who helped brighten up the season, to the tune of up to 100 million credits for the top 5% of contributors.

* GalNet Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 12,327 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

LHS 1798 Gold Life Systems

Earls of Miritu

Iktomisi Advanced Group

Cartel of Cebalrai

Herfjongo Independent League

Allied HIP 113103 Dominion

Kutjalangai Allied and Co

Turd Wura Corp.

Togher Movement

HR 755 Electronics Commodities

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 950 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

Santjalan Labour

Bureau of LHS 6027 Liberty Party

Glusargiz Energy Exchange

CD-66 2585 Purple Cartel

Wolf 1458 Society

Aurgel Silver Hand Gang

Svanticani Purple Public Prtnrs

HIP 24968 Energy Corp.

Wuluwait Boys

CD-70 19 Public Incorporated

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* GalNet Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,272 minor factions in lockdown:

Bumbur Purple Central Limited

Gorgon Crimson Pirates

Labour of Zlota Lung

LHS 2771 Party

Chin Purple Life Ltd

72 Herculis Silver Dragons

QQ Pegasi Partners

New 26 Ophiuchi Labour

44 chi Draconis Combine

Kairi Republic Party

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,258 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Wolf 867 Dynamic Co

BPM 590 Purple Ring

Thule Empire League

LP 193-564 Major Solutions

Li Tzicnii Galactic and Co

Ned Erh PLC

Marquis du LTT 6255

People's Epsilon Scorpii Resistance

Kwangwutii Inc

Kipgensi Industries

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Firework Appeal Comes to an End
Having received a deluge of deliveries, Independent Cherets Labour has announced that its recent appeal for Anduliga Fireworks has been successful. Central to the success of the appeal were the scores of independent combat pilots who kept the spaceways of Cherets clear, and ensured those delivering fireworks to Bucky Hub could do so safely. A spokesperson for Independent Cherets Labour expressed satisfaction at the outcome:

\It's always heartening to see the galactic community come together, especially when it's in the service of a really big party. We'd like to extend our gratitude to all those who delivered fireworks to us here at Bucky Hub, and who took care of the agitators clogging up the spaceways. Thanks to you, 3302 is going to start with a really big bang!\


* Personnel at Obsidian Orbital Confirm Starport Still Operational
Recent news that Obsidian Orbital had joined the list of malfunctioning starports caused dismay among the galactic community, as the public had played a significant role in the station's construction, but it seems that personnel at the starport are determined to keep it running. A member of the station's technical team released a brief statement to the media:

\The problems at the station have worsened over the past few weeks, but we're determined that Obsidian Orbital won't close. We're working around the clock, and burning through resources, but so far we haven't had to suspend any services.\

Despite this achievement, station personnel stressed they had not found a solution to the technological 'plague' blighting the galaxy, which continues to affect starports throughout inhabited space.


* GalNet Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections.

Conservatives of Praavapri

MCC 378 Vision Incorporated

Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star

League of 36 Ursae Majoris

LHS 1885 League

Lhou Xuang Prison Colony

* The Canonn Searching for Barnacles in the Pleiades
Dr Arcanonn, head of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has released a statement to the media:

\For the past four weeks we have been investigating a curious new commodity called 'meta-alloys'. Many of my colleagues believe there is a link between this commodity and the unknown artefacts, as meta-alloys are linked to objects known colloquially as 'large barnacles', which have some artefact-like qualities.\

\We have also been conducting a deep planetary survey of Merope, since the UAs point there, looking for anything out of the ordinary. So far, nothing has been found, but I'm now certain that there is a secret to uncover somewhere in the Pleiades, if not in Merope itself.\

\My assistant, Socha Korbemile, insists that we will find large barnacles in the Pleiades, and I am convinced this is worth investigating. So I urge all commanders with planetary landing suites to scour the planets of the Pleiades for these large barnacles. They must be studied!\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* A Week in Powerplay
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon signed a trade agreement with the Partha system this week, bringing the total number of Alliance-aligned trade centres to 86. Profitability throughout the Alliance trade network remains the envy of all other powers.

President Zachary Hudson's Federal fleet set a new record by delivering more garrison supplies to naval bases in a single week than ever before. This valiant effort brought an end to nearly a month of contraction, wherein a total of six naval bases were abandoned.

Shadow President Felicia Winters retained a stable hold on her domain, neither gaining nor losing influence with any system. The coming week could bring three additional systems under her sway. Extensive aid campaigns are underway in Chireni, HIP 47328, and Hyades sector EB-X D1-110. Each of these systems would be a strong contributor to the Shadow President's plans for the future.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval had an uncommonly quiet week, allowing excess resources to carry over to this week. Several systems are currently vying for the security services offered by the Shield of Justice. Resources are limited, and the Shield of Justice may only be extended to four or five systems in the weeks to come. The Kartenes system is currently subject to Shield of Justice patrols.

Princess Aisling Duval has long enjoyed relative peace in her domain, but systems occasionally leave her list of supporters. Such is the case this week with Ienpalang, an Imperial system known primarily for its agriculture and tourism. It is rumoured that the system's leadership desires to return the institution of Imperial slavery to prominence, contrary to Aisling's ethos, although Princess Aisling has yet to publicly comment on the situation.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was able to return Sirius to a state of solvency this week. A total of six systems were cut from the Sirius portfolio over the past four weeks, but now that Sirius is back in the black, it is likely Li Yong-Rui will attempt to re-establish relationships with some of those systems.

Simguru Pranav Antal may have foreseen a day when Utopian enclaves were established in 45 systems, but few outside the commune ever thought it possible. Against the odds, the once-quiet commune now holds sway in 45 influential systems, enveloping nearly 113 billion inhabitants \u2013 a remarkable achievement for a fledgling power that emphasizes peaceful interaction.

Senator Zemina Torval sold off controlling interests in Nerthus this week, allowing her enterprises to cover other liabilities, and leaving some command capital for future investment. Shrewd investment will be required to keep Torval's business profitable.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine quietly busied himself with spreading discord in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini and HIP 103138. Insurrections are currently underway in both systems, and no new strongholds were established by the Kumo Crew this week.

Senator Denton Patreus encountered record resistance this week, preventing his fleets from securing the Contie and Yankas systems. The senator's financial situation also took a turn for the worse, leading to turmoil in six control systems. If the economic situation in Patreus's territory remains doesn't improve, his fleets could lose their berths in Guguroro, HIP 13841, HIP 98211, Lao Zi, LTT 47, and Shonso.

* The Worlds Beyond
Utopian delegates returned today from the first symposium of the Pioneers Cooperative, a group dedicated to supporting expansion into uninhabited space. Also attending were representatives from Loren's Legion, Communism Interstellar, the Black Birds Squadron, Aisling's Angels, the Canonn, the Independent Pilots Consortium, Emperor's Grace, the Mercs of Mikunn, United German Commanders, EXO, the First Great Expedition, the Code, Adle's Armada, the Guardians of Harmony, CHIMERA, the Distant Worlds Admins and the Hutton Orbital Truckers.

\To live is to grow, and mankind must push ever outwards\ said one attending Utopian explorer. \Humanity has come here today, unified, under a banner of progress, and Utopia is proud to add its support to this noble venture. Our commune in Takurua demonstrated that expansion beyond the core systems is possible, and the success of Obsidian Orbital in Maia shows that mankind has a shared desire to expand the frontiers of human space and scientific understanding.\

* The Achenar Challenge
The Imperial capital system of Achenar has recently attracted the attention of thrill-seeking Commanders of the Pilots Federation. Achenar's third planet has become a proving ground where bragging rights are earned in what is known as the 'Achenar Challenge'.

Proctor Ulrich von Braun, whose only concern until recently was the safety of Imperial Naval Academy students during high-g training, posted the following advisory:

\The force of gravity on the surface of Achenar 3 is approximately 6.7 times that of Earth. Any who wish to hazard this so-called 'Achenar Challenge' are advised that they do so at their own risk. Pilots accustomed to landing on planets in the 3-4 g range are much more likely to alight here safely. Underestimate Achenar 3 and you may never leave.\

Over 100 craft have crashed on Achenar 3 since mid December.

* Sirius Corporation Confirms Discovery of Antares Wreckage
A few months ago, the Sirius Corporation launched a search for the remains of the Antares, an innovative passenger liner that disappeared during its maiden voyage over fifty years ago. The search resulted in the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of space-borne debris, which was then subjected to rigorous analysis by the Sirius Corporation to determine its origin. The result of that analysis has now been announced: the remains of the Antares have been found. Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Gov, released a brief statement to the media:

\Words cannot adequately express how delighted I am with this outcome. I was always hopeful we would find the remains of the Antares, and I am very pleased to have my optimism validated. I would like to thank all those at the Sirius Corporation that have worked so tirelessly to analyse the recovered debris over the past few weeks.\

Li Yong-Rui went on to speculate about the implications of the discovery:

\The wreckage appears to confirm that the component failure described in the ship's final status report did indeed result in the destruction of the Antares. My hope is that by subjecting the wreckage to further analysis, we will be able to determine exactly what caused the malfunction and apply this knowledge to the development of new safety protocols. With luck, we will be able to reintroduce the innovative drive technology used aboard the Antares. This discovery could serve as the catalyst for a whole new era of interplanetary travel.\


* Obsidian Orbital Continuing to Deteriorate
Recent reports from Obsidian Orbital, one of the starports affected by the mysterious malfunctions sweeping the galaxy, indicate that the situation at the starport has worsened. According to the station's technical team, the starport is only a hair's breadth from having to suspend services:

\Despite our best efforts, things are only getting worse. We're experiencing all kinds of malfunctions, and if the situation doesn't improve soon we'll have to start shutting down station services.\

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.

* Unidentified Signal in Pleiades Nebula
A fragmentary signal has been received by the flight operations team at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system. The source of the signal has not been identified, but the strength of signal indicates it originated from a star system approximately 23 light years from Maia. Unfortunately, interference from a local black hole has made it impossible to determine a vector for the transmission.

The signal, which lasted only a few seconds, had degraded so much that only a small string of numbers could be extracted. Some have speculated the numbers may be coordinates of some kind: b?n?r? ??a??t L??: 2?.?? ??n?: 9?.??

Pilots in the region are advised to keep on the lookout, and to offer assistance if needed.


* A Week in Powerplay
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was unable to orchestrate any new trade agreements this week, but the coming week holds potential for new opportunities in the Dao Zi and Ross 931 systems. Very little else of note has transpired in Alliance territory since our last report.

President Zachary Hudson gathered intelligence from Frey and Lalande 37120, and has deployed Federal fleets to establish a more permanent naval presence in both systems. Sufficient resources were collected last week to seek out another appropriate base for the Federal Navy. More news on that will likely follow next week.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's Shield of Justice failed to secure Kartenes, as command capital reserves fell short late in the week. Crime sweeps are currently active in Hrun, Kherthaje, Neites and Waimiri, but if command capital supplies remain low, opportunities to station the Shield of Justice in these systems will also fail.

Shadow President Felicia Winters' aid campaigns in Chireni, HIP 47328 and Hyades Sector EB-X D1-110 failed this week. Budgetary challenges prevented all three missions from reaching a successful outcome. Despite last week's shortfall, aid campaigns are currently underway in Amuzgo and Sawali.

Princess Aisling Duval was very successful with fundraising campaigns this week, granting her the opportunity to court the favour of several key systems. Ekono, HIP 77470, Madngela, Nuxalkuq are currently on her itinerary.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui has had a very positive week. The momentous discovery of the Antares wreckage, coupled with the continued prosperity of SiriusGov, has been a cause for celebration for the Sirius Corporation. Business relationships in Dongkum, HIP 23395 and Kenna are being investigated this week, paving the way for the potential expansion of Sirius to a total of 57 systems.

Senator Zemina Torval managed her business skilfully this week, narrowly evading a deficit. The senator is currently attempting to acquire controlling interest in the Chujohimba system. Future expansion of her enterprises will require great effort.

Simguru Pranav Antal had another successful week. Two systems \u2013 Azalai and GCRV 2743 \u2013 formalized relationships with Utopia and joined the commune. The once miniscule power now directly controls 47 key systems, and projects its influence through 517 systems and nearly 125 billion people.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine experienced a relatively quiet week. Kumo Crew-backed insurrections in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini and HIP 103138 were soundly defeated, but attempts to overthrow the governments of Djabijabus, and Devata Baru are now in motion.

Senator Denton Patreus' overcommitted and undermanned fleets withdrew from five systems, greatly reducing his administrative overhead. The senator is now looking to establish bases in more strategically valuable locations, including 23 Delta Piscis Austrini, which was recently attacked by the Kumo Crew.

* Good News from Obsidian Orbital
Following yesterday's remarkable discovery of non-human structures in the Pleiades Nebula, starport markets have been inundated with meta-alloys \u2013 a mysterious material produced by the alien 'barnacles'. At present, very little is known about this commodity, but it seems it may have helped bring some stability to Obsidian Orbital, one of the starports affected by the mysterious malfunctions sweeping the galaxy. According to a recent statement, the station's technical team conducted an eleventh-hour experiment that, remarkably, seems to have improved things at the beleaguered starport:

\Things have gone from bad to worse recently, so when the meta-alloys started flooding in we thought...why not give it a shot? And somehow it seems to have worked. I don't know how the meta-alloys helped, exactly, but we think they're countering whatever it is that's causing the malfunctions. As soon as we have more concrete information, we'll let you know. For now we're remaining cautiously optimistic.\

The exact cause of the technological 'plague' blighting the galaxy is still not known, so whether the meta-alloys represent a permanent solution can only be guessed. But many will be hoping that this breakthrough heralds the end of the mysterious malfunction epidemic.


* Alien 'Barnacles' Discovered in the Pleiades
Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released a statement in response to the discovery of non-human structures in the Pleiades Nebula:

\This is a momentous day \u2013 alien structures have been confirmed on at least two planets in the Pleiades Nebula! I must congratulate Commander Octo, who made the initial discovery on Merope 5c, and thank Commander Snax, who contacted me. Within minutes, Canonn scientists and other commanders were at the site.\

\We now know of multiple barnacles on Merope 5c, and the corrupted message recently received in Maia has led us to many more on Pleiades Sector JC-U B3-2.\

\I can confirm that these structures produce meta-alloys, emit a sound similar to that made by the Unknown Artefacts, and bear mysterious markings that we have yet to identify. Some commanders have reported malfunctions near the structures, which might explain the crashed ships found near many of the barnacles.\

* Empire Ousted from Facece System
Recent reports indicate that an independent faction known as the Allied Facece Order has wrested control of the Facece system from the Empire. Details are scarce, but it is believed that the Allied Facece Order took control of the system after achieving several strategic victories against Imperial Naval forces. Chancellor Anders Blaine, who was until recently the system's primary administrator, was approached for comment:

\I want to assure the people of Facece that the current state of affairs is only temporary. The Facece system will soon return to Imperial control, and the rebels who have undermined our authority will be made to answer for their crimes.\


* More Starports Fall Victim to Technological Plague
Authorities in Eravate, Almar and Halbangaay have confirmed that theirs are the latest systems to experience mysterious technical issues, bringing the total number of systems affected by what some are calling 'the technological plague' to 22.

* Galactic News: Faction's Appeal Successful
According a statement from the Green Party of HIP 112974, the faction's recent appeal for onionhead has been successful. In the statement, a spokesperson confirmed the faction had received sufficient quantities of the drug to establish a new onionhead-trading operation:

\We're hugely grateful to all the traders who made deliveries to la Cosa City, and all the pilots who kept the traders safe by clearing the agitators from our spaceways. May this be the start of a long a profitable relationship between the Green Party of HIP 112974 and the galactic community.\

The Green Party of HIP 112974 has confirmed that those who contributed to the appeal could collect their rewards from la Cosa City in HIP 112974.


* Community Goal: Emperor's Dawn 'Shadow' Cells Discovered
When the Federal Navy destroyed the Emperor's Dawn base in the Kausalya system in December, many believed the organisation had finally been defeated. The Federal offensive, which was supported by a large deputation from the Federal Navy Auxiliary, was swift and merciless, and resulted in the total destruction of the insurgent outpost. But a statement from the office of Imperial Senator Denton Patreus indicates that, against all odds, Emperor's Dawn has endured.

\The Imperial Internal Security Service has discovered that Emperor's Dawn has 'shadow' cells in the Dakshmandi, Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems \u2013 secret outposts that were apparently designed to protect the organisation's leadership in the event of a military defeat. It is of course vital to the continued security of the Empire and its people that these outposts be neutralised as swiftly as possible. If it is not, Emperor's Dawn could re-emerge to threaten the galaxy once again.\

Senator Patreus went on to issue a call to arms:

\Swiftly neutralising these outposts depends on the support of the galactic community, and to this end I have authorised the payment of privateer bonds to any pilots who help with the offensive against Emperor's Dawn. Let us destroy these vile dissidents once and for all.\


* Community Goal: Professor Ishmael Palin Issues Request for Meta-Alloys
A remarkable discovery was made last week when non-human structures were found on a number of planets in the Pleiades Nebula. These 'barnacles', as the galactic community has christened them, produce a material known as meta-alloys, the exact properties of which are not yet known.

The discovery was followed swiftly by news that technical personnel at Obsidian Orbital \u2013 one of the starports affected by the mysterious malfunctions sweeping the galaxy \u2013 had apparently used meta-alloys to return the starport to some kind of normality. Naturally, this prompted speculation that the meta-alloys might hold the key to eradicating the technological plague that has blighted so many starports in recent months.

Professor Ishmael Palin, the former Federal scientist conducting research into the unknown artefacts, is evidently thinking along the same lines:

\The report from Obsidian Orbital is indeed encouraging, but there is still a great deal we do not know, including the cause of the malfunctions, or if the meta-alloys are indeed capable of countering them. That is why I am appealing to the galactic community to deliver as many meta-alloys as possible to my new research base at Obsidian Orbital. Only by amassing a substantial research sample can we know for sure whether or not the meta-alloys can be used to target this mysterious technological malady.\

Professor Palin has pledged to reward all pilots who deliver meta-alloys to his base of operations at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Galactic News: Sirius Corporation Reveals Results of Analysis
Following the recent discovery of the remains of the Antares, the Sirius Corporation has been subjecting the wreckage to extensive analysis in an attempt to determine exactly what happened to the luxury liner. In a press conference held this morning, a spokesperson for the organisation revealed the initial results of the analysis:

\Our investigation has confirmed the original finding that a cascade failure in the hyperdrive's internal containment systems caused a catastrophic explosion within the drive. The mapped wreckage pattern suggests that the failure occurred while the Antares was transitioning from normal space to hyperspace. The precise cause of the failure remains unexplained, however. We will continue to analyse the available data to see what more we can learn.\


* GalNet Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections.

Here are 10 of the 2,993 minor factions holding elections:

Law Party of Njulngan

Dhang Defence Force

Ross 23 Incorporated

LTT 305 Electronics Network

Omagatae Liberals

Vogulu Empire Assembly

HIP 18187 Blue Legal Partners

Niu Lang O Electronics Company

Ti Wa Blue Allied Company

Vistobici Corporation

Elections occur when two minor factions of a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon approved trade agreements with the leaders of Dao Zi and Ross 931 this week, bringing a total of 88 preferred trading partners under his influence. A truly impressive trade network now supports the Alliance economy, and representatives of Ross 842 are currently seeking to become another node in that highly lucrative network.

President Zachary Hudson made an appearance at the new Federal navy base in the Frey system, while Vice President Brad Mitchell presided over the opening of another naval base in Lalande 37120. Both systems expand the protection of the Federal fleets to frontier worlds near the troubled Pegasi Sector. Meanwhile, a new naval base is currently being established in the Muncheim system.

Shadow President Felicia Winters was unable to secure support in Sawali and Amuzgo last week, but a glimmer of hope still shines in these systems. Renewed aid campaigns aim to motivate Sawali and Amuzgo to vote 'Liberal', although it's likely only one of these campaigns will bear fruit. Political analysts lean toward Sawali as the most likely to pledge its support to the Shadow President.

Senator Zemina Torval had an unexpectedly profitable week, sending stocks in her enterprise soaring. This success was made possible in large part by the acquisition of the Chujohimba system. Senator Torval is expected to make another investment this week, this time in the Timbarichs system.

Princess Aisling Duval's tour through Ekono, HIP 77470 and Chnumar successfully stimulated interest in the Princess's cause. If system leaders in all three systems pledge their support, a total of 64 key systems will formally enforce the Princess's abolitionist agenda. Aisling Duval is also rumoured to be courting the leaders of the Nyalayan system. Further news is expected in one week's time.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval withdrew Shield of Justice forces from the Nyalayan system this week, and a lack of resources for the Emperor's fleet may lead to withdrawals from Bragit, Candecama, Rurema, He Xingo, and Yao Tzu. No new contracts for Shield of Justice security details in Hrun, Kherthaje, Neites, and Waimiri were fulfilled, as another side-effect of the supply shortfall.

Simguru Pranav Antal established a presence in the Peregrina system this week - a dubious achievement given that the only life-bearing body in Peregrina has been cordoned off due to native pathogens. Any ship passing through the moon's atmosphere is automatically designated a plague ship, refused docking in all systems, and attacked on sight by faction and system security forces. At the time of writing, Utopian delegates are opening relations with the Dongkum system, and preparing to open enclaves in Taosha and Sukree.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui had to deal with another unexpected financial hiccup this week. Attempts to acquire assets in the private and government sectors in Dongkum, HIP 23395 and Kenna were underfunded, and failed. CEO Yong-Rui now has to consider either purchasing the assets of Kwaritreni, or selling off the assets of Ticua.

Senator Denton Patreus amassed an enormous budgetary surplus this week, and will likely seek to expand his influence in several systems next week. Sales of arms and other supplies are currently taking place in the Katurru system. Meanwhile, 23 Delta Piscis Austrini is playing host to the senator's fleets, and could become a permanent Naval berth.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's bid to take control of Djabijabus and Devata Baru were unsuccessful. Kumo Crew fleets remained undaunted, however, pressing advantages in open insurrections in HIP 103138 and Tjakiri. At the time of writing, signs of insurrection are also beginning to appear in the HIP 109144 system.

* Freelance Report: Leading Scientist Expresses Doubts
Yesterday, Professor Ishmael Palin called upon independent pilots to deliver meta-alloys \u2013 produced by the newly discovered 'barnacles' in the Pleiades Nebula \u2013 to Obsidian Orbital, suggesting that the material could be the cure for the technological virus spreading through inhabited space. But Professor Violet Belbin of the Xenological Research Institute has expressed doubts:

\I would caution against assuming that this material is the answer to our problems. The nature of these 'barnacles' is not fully understood. They could be a form of alien life, and harvesting them could have unforeseen consequences. The Xenological Research Institute is sending a team to Maia and asks that Professor Palin takes our concerns into consideration.\

Pilots have already started delivering cargo holds full of meta-alloys to Professor Palin's base of operations at Obsidian Orbital.

* Freelance Report: Officials Deny Funding 'Turbo Hour' Endurance Race
Officials at Kanwar Horizons in the Turbo system have strenuously denied allegations of involvement in an unsanctioned Buckyball Racing Club event known as the 'Turbo Hour Endurance Race', which will apparently run alongside the station's annual air show and starship exhibition.

Station entertainment director Hector LeMans described as \preposterous\ claims that the Turbo Blue Netcoms Exchange was secretly bankrolling the race in order to attract larger crowds. \Our air show is wholesome entertainment, and we don't want it ruined by these Buckyballers and their 'high-octane' shenanigans,\ he said.

LeMans had a clear message for anyone tempted by rumours of free ship resprays for the winners: \I'm sure that authorities in the 49 D Orionis, Unkulcay and Vasak systems would agree that racers will find the same strictly-enforced speed limits and standard market prices for fuel and repairs at our stations as any other law-abiding pilot.\

The air show will run from the 25th of January to the 12th of February.

* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This weekly transmission lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy, based on the latest data.

Here are 10 of the 15,071 minor factions involved in a civil war:

Quan Gurus Crimson Public Ltd

Traditional HIP 22052 Constitution Party

Purple Legal Systems

Ghimal Nobles

Union of Ghimal Independents

CD-70 1960 Organisation

Democratic Party

Hayanzib Purple Council\t

Hayanzib Allied Corp.

Kinematic Armaments

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 6,570 minor factions at war:

LTT 18486 Jet Energy Company

United LHS 3479 Green Party

Skollanga Silver Organisation

BD+21 1952 General Company

Family of HIP 3509

Leschanatya Future

Merengila Netcoms Commodities

Revolutionary Bugulmara Future

Yab Camalo Purple Dynamic Ltd

He Po Mob

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Professor Ishmael Palin Responds to Fellow Scientist's Concerns
Professor Ishmael Palin, the scientist conducting research into the Unknown Artefacts, has issued a response to Violet Belbin of the Xenological Research Institute. Professor Belbin recently released a statement in which she suggested that Professor Palin was exercising insufficient caution over the meta-alloys \u2013 the substance produced by the so-called 'barnacles' discovered in the Pleiades Nebula.

\I have nothing but respect for Professor Belbin, but on this occasion I feel her concerns are misplaced. There is no evidence that the meta-alloys are harmful, and I can assure the professor that my team and I will take every precaution when handling and testing them. Furthermore, I am not rushing to any conclusions regarding their possible application. We do not know if the meta-alloys can counter the malfunctions affecting our starports, which is precisely why I wish to study them. As a scientist, I feel an obligation to contribute to a deeper understanding of this material.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion List
Each week, GalNet presents a list of 10 of the 1,370 minor factions currently expanding into new systems.

Orgen Citizen Party

The Gathering

League of Mannona

Confederacy of Bondranses

Labour of Cochi\t

Indines Commodities

Ambirikar Imperial Society

Expansion occurs when a minor faction reaches a sufficient influence rating and there is a populated system within striking distance. The act of expansion is a costly one, and the wealth and development rating suffers during the period of expansion.

* Galactic News: Sirius Corporation Responds to Calls for Clarity
Since the wreckage of the Highliner Antares was recovered several weeks ago, the families of those who lost their lives aboard the ship have been lobbying the Sirius Corporation for more information. Specifically, questions have been asked about where the wreckage was found, and if any human remains were recovered. The corporation, evidently aware that the public is hungry for information, has now released a statement:

\We are aware that some sectors of the galactic community believe we have not been sufficiently transparent regarding our research into the Antares. Please be assured that any lack of clarity is in no way indicative of a desire to withhold information \u2013 it is simply a reflection of our focus on our research.\

\In light of this, we can confirm that the remains of the Antares were found in the Luyten 205-128 system, and that no organic remains were recovered. As for the cause of the explosion, we can only reiterate our earlier statement that a cascade failure in the hyperdrive's internal containment systems triggered an explosion within the drive. Although the precise cause of the explosion is not yet known, we believe any additional information will only corroborate our assessment that the destruction of the Antares was nothing more than a tragic accident.\

\We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to those who lost loved ones aboard the Antares.\


* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Receives Death Threats
Dr Arcanonn from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released a statement to the galactic media:

\I am now working from a new laboratory, two kilometres underground, at a secret location. My colleagues have forced me to relocate in the interests of my own safety. The death threats began shortly after I urged the galactic community to search for the barnacles. As word reached us of fellow scientists disappearing under mysterious circumstances, we realised the threats were not idle.\

\But the work must go on. I urge you to continue to gather meta-alloys for Professor Palin. He is our best hope to solve the station malfunctions. But stay away from people harbouring the irrational idea that this endeavour will lead to our annihilation.\

* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 12,177 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Chi Herculis Creative Group

HIP 62249 Allied Limited

66 Draconis Incorporated

Maurr Monarchy

Worker's Party of HIP 38235

Monarchy of Treima

Laturesingo Empire Group

HIP 112441 Services

Rio Paha State Group

Bestia General Organisation

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 610 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

LTT 5455 Jet Clan

League of George Pantazis Defence Force

Sha Gigas Ltd

Dragons of Urvane

Future of Zeta Fornacis

HIP 18527 Liberty Party

V1581 Cygni Gold Rats

Kruger 60 and Co

LHS 215 Purple Galactic Ind

Cordenet Jet Ring

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Freelance Report: Pilot Breaks Eight-Hour Sagittarius A* Barrier
Buckyball champion Commander Alot has broken the eight-hour barrier for a trip from Sol to Sagittarius A* in his ship, Rhonda the Anaconda. Having failed in his first attempt to set a sub-eight hour record by just six seconds, Commander Alot ultimately succeeded in completing the 25,900 light year journey in 7 hours, 56 minutes and 41 seconds. He announced his success in characteristically matter-of-fact style at 2.00 pm on the 24th of January: \That's. More. Like it.\

No stranger to the Sagittarius A* Buckyball challenge, Commander Alot has made the trip no fewer seven times. He has more or less dominated the number-one slot since first wresting it away from the original record holder, Commander Anuranium, in April 3301, when he completed the run in 11 hours and 46 minutes.

As tributes from fellow Buckyball pilots poured in, the 'fastest pilot in the galaxy' confirmed he would be taking a well-earned break from the cockpit, although he said he hoped to catch up with the Distant Worlds expedition later in the year.

* Galactic News: Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,128 minor factions in lockdown:

Progressive Party of Nawait

Binjamingi Allied Ltd

Ining Industry

Union of Contien Progressive Party

Ngaru Services

Neperimpox Jet Fortune Ind

Sietae Federal Corp.

Igal Empire Assembly

Fretensis Patronage

HIP 1885 Patron's Principles

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,104 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Pontae Camorra

Laifan Co

Taramaliwa Allied Commodities

LP 466-235 Fortune Corporation\t

Iota Horologii Ltd

Wayan Energy Network

Democrats of Masans

Manbatz Systems

Uniting Noegin

United Nedos League

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Weekly Powers Update Incoming
In the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT), the GalNet monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled.

Any pilots who operate for one of the powers must deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time to ensure their activities are registered.


* Community Goal: Campaign to Develop i Sola Prospect
The Imperial Inquisition is known for regularly organising competitive combat events, ranging from small-scale skirmishes to the popular 'Hunter Games', an intense 20-person gladiatorial competition. As one might expect, members of the organisation make frequent use of outfitting services, but they are constrained by the fact that their nearest outpost offers only a limited range of options. That's why the faction has launched a campaign to develop its local outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1.

Central to the initiative is a request for industrial materials, which the Imperial Inquisition will use to upgrade the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a brief statement:

\Developing i Sola Prospect will mean that every type of weapon, ship and component needed to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience is always available. Naturally this will also be a huge boon to the galactic community.\

If the campaign is successful, i Sola Prospect will become the first planetary outpost to boast a complete range of services, including a comprehensive shipyard.


* Community Goal: The Search for Starship One
In May 3301, the personal vessel of the Federal president, Starship One, disappeared en route to the Azaleach system. An investigation was promptly launched, but the fate of the vessel and her crew, which included then-president Jasmina Halsey, could not be conclusively determined. In a statement released earlier today, Federal President Zachary Hudson announced his intention to resume the search for the ship, inspired by the discovery of the remains of the liner Antares:

\Like many others, I was heartened by the Sirius Corporation's success, and I found myself thinking that if the remains of a ship lost fifty years ago could be found, surely a ship lost less than a year ago could also be recovered. I am therefore offering generous reimbursements to pilots who deliver wreckage components to the Federal research outpost at Leoniceno Orbital in the Azaleach system. Once we have gathered enough material, we will analyse the debris to determine if any of it is from Starship One. If we are able to find the remains of the ship, we may be able to determine what happened to President Halsey and the rest of the ship's crew.\

But it appears that President Hudson is not the only person eager to find Starship One. In a strange turn of events, an organisation by the name of Daurtu Jet Comms PLC has also announced its intention to search for the missing presidential vessel. Virtually nothing is known about Daurtu Jet Comms PLC, but the fact that it is offering even larger rewards than the Federation may convince pilots to lend the organisation their support.


* Galactic News: Professor Ishmael Palin Announces Breakthrough
Professor Ishmael Palin has announced that his request for meta-alloys has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to his research base at Obsidian Orbital. In a statement, the Professor expressed his satisfaction at the response, and also shared news of a dramatic breakthrough in his research into the Unknown Artefacts:

\For much of the past week I have been investigating the ongoing technical issues at Obsidian Orbital, and I can now confirm what many of us have long suspected: the Unknown Artefacts are most definitely the cause.\

\Apparently the objects have the ability to repair themselves \u2013 to re-grow, even \u2013 by extracting the necessary non-organic materials from their immediate environment. It really is quite remarkable. That's why they harm ships and other machinery \u2013 if they are damaged when they're scooped up, they use the metals in a ship's hull, or a starport's superstructure, to repair themselves. Even minor damage will trigger the self-repair mechanism.\

\What is still not clear is if the meta-alloys can be used to counter this harmful process. That is what my team and I will be investigating over the coming weeks, using the research sample provided by the galactic community. As soon as we have something concrete to share with the public, we will do so.\

This remarkable announcement represents a significant development in UA research, but it leaves the wider questions of the objects' origin and purpose unanswered.


* Galactic News: Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections.

V2689 Orionis Limited

Matia Empire League

Xuanduna Imperial Society

Nagnutli Gold Federal Partners

Wapiya Crimson Universal Systems

HIP 116436 Empire League

Labour of Acane

Elections occur when two minor factions of a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Powerplay: Weekly Report
President Zachary Hudson secured a new base for the Federal Navy in the Muncheim system this week. The coming week holds potential for three additional bases in Detta, Dongkum and HIP 24046. Should these additional systems be secured, the President will be responsible for a total of 79 naval bases.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's negotiators were unable to secure an equitable trade agreement with the Ross 842 system this week, but Alliance representatives have returned with additional incentives for the leaders of Ross 842 to consider.

Shadow President Felicia Winters is moving forward with her aid campaign in Amuzgo, hoping to prove that Federal values have a place in the future of the independent system. At the time of writing, her most significant Liberal propaganda campaign is underway in the Fasti system, followed by the Kali system.

Princess Aisling Duval's media blitzes in Chnumar, Ekono and HIP 77470 ended unsuccessfully. Fundraising campaigns came up short in HIP 116045 and Tsanla, jeopardizing the influence of the People's Princess in those systems. If funding becomes available, the media blitzes in the Nyalayan and Kuki An systems could lead to additional supporters for the Princess.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny Duval's supporters delivered nearly one billion garrison supplies in an attempt to counter resource shortfalls in her domain. Supplies were bottlenecked in the Guathiti system, where over half of the supplies remained, exacerbating the shortage. As a result, the Shield of Justice was forced to withdraw from Yao Tzu, Rurema, He Xingo and Candecama.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was unable to purchase the assets of the Kwaritreni system, but retained the Ticua system. The Kwaritreni system remains a subject of interest for Sirius, and an offer of franchise is currently being resubmitted. At the time of writing, two additional systems - Zhao Tzu and Wong Zhi \u2013 are also being offered Sirius franchises.

Simguru Pranav Antal's ambassadors were denied the opportunity to open Utopian enclaves in Sukree and Taosha this week. Meanshile, ambassadors have returned to Taosha in the hope of rekindling an interest in Utopia, and Utopian forces are currently engaged in Kenna and Yemotepa. Should Antal secure both systems, Utopian enclaves will be present in 50 key systems.

Senator Zemina Torval is currently dealing with a budget deficit in her enterprise. If the situation does not improve, the assets of Wolfberg, Secoya and HIP 107936 will be sold to offset the deficit. If sufficient funding is made available, the senator could acquire a controlling stake in the Yakama system.

Senator Denton Patreus experienced significant opposition to the deployment of his private fleet in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini this week. Attempts are currently being made to negotiate the supply of arms and munitions in exchange for long-term berthing of the senator's fleets in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's attempts to take control of Tjakiri and HIP 109144 were rebuffed. Meanwhile, resistance forces in Bhattra, He Xians and Brynhilio have risen up, providing the first real glimmer of hope that a system occupied by the Kumo Crew could overthrow its conquerors. Federal freedom fighters have claimed credit for inciting the uprisings.

* Freelance Report: Conflict Erupts at Obsidian Orbital
Anti-meta-alloy protests have spilled into violence during the final day of Professor Ishmael Palin's request. Groups of protestors blockaded the entrance to Obsidian Orbital, and as talks between station personnel and the protestors broke down, tempers flared. One of those gathering meta-alloys for Professor Palin offered this first-hand account:

\I received a message from one of my wing-mates that things weren't looking good at Obsidian, but I had a full hold, so I had to go. As I dropped into Maia I saw that my ship's computer had put me about eight kilometres from the starport. Then I saw the Cutter coming at me with hardpoints deploying, and the next thing I knew I was taking fire!\

\My Asp isn't the best when it comes to a head-on fight, but I knew if I could get through the mail slot I would be fine. I boosted like hell and just managed to make it through. I lost my shields and about 50% of my hull, but I managed.\

For the time being, it's a dangerous game in Maia.

* Galactic News: Cryptic Messages Found in Local Bulletins
A number of pilots have reported cryptic finding messages in starports' news feeds. The origin of the messages is not clear, but they share certain characteristics, including references to apparent criminal activity, and in some cases coordinates. Often the messages are partially corrupted, suggesting they were originally hidden in the news feeds in an encoded form. Precisely why the messages have started surfacing in the public news channel is unclear.

Are these messages genuine criminal communiqu\u00e9s, or merely a creative hoax? We leave you to decide.

* Galactic News: Unidentified Spacecraft Observed at Obsidian Orbital
Speculation is rife at Obsidian Orbital this morning following a close-quarters encounter with an unidentified Diamondback Explorer. According to Chloe Anders, a member of the surveillance team at Christian Dock, the mysterious vessel came within 10 kilometres of the station while performing what was described as a \high-speed pass\:

\I saw it approach and assumed it was about to submit a docking request, but instead it just started circling the station. It had an unusual designation \u2013 \S6: 7\ \u2013 so I tried hailing it, but there was no response. Then our sensors lit up. I couldn't believe it \u2013 the damned thing was scanning the station! I told the weapons team to stand by, but the next thing I knew, it was gone.\

Asked for her opinion of the vessel's purpose, Anders said: \I know it sounds crazy, but when I saw it circling the station like that, the only thing I could think was that it was looking for something.\

* Galactic News: Empire Calls in Reinforcements
Two weeks ago, the Imperial Internal Security Service discovered 'shadow' cells belonging to the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn in the Dakshmandi, Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems. Military fleets were swiftly despatched to the pertinent systems to destroy the last remaining vestiges of Emperor's Dawn. But recent reports indicate that the campaign may not be going quite as well as the Empire hoped. An Imperial pilot stationed in Dakshmandi spoke briefly with a correspondent from the Imperial Herald:

\The insurgents may be resilient, but their days are numbered. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. It might take a little longer than planned, but Emperor's Dawn is going down, I can promise you that.\

The Empire is understood to have sent reinforcements to the Dakshmandi, Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems to support its forces.


* Galactic News: Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 1,151 minor factions in lockdown:

Milpiriyo Vision Commodities

New Boreas Union

V492 Lyrae Purple Dragons

LHS 1167 Blue Brothers

Lu Yupik Creative Network

GD 69 League

Quan Gurus Crimson Public Ltd

Defence Force of Wheemehimo\t

Kagudi Front

Gatoborod Partners

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 1,141 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Gun Jet Netcoms Inc

Nysa Exchange

Hamal Hand Gang

Ch'u Ti Co

Bandjigali Jet Creative Network

Scorpions Order

New Unktomi Democrats

Atropos Major Network

Bang Vision Services

Labour of V902 Centauri

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Galactic News: Federation Begins Analysing Wreckage
Over the past week, hundreds of pilots have been searching for signs of Starship One, the Federal presidential vessel that disappeared in May 3301. Two factions had a stake in the search \u2013 the Azaleach Partnership, which was acting on behalf of Federal President Zachary Hudson, and the Daurtu Jet Comms PLC, an organisation about which very little is known.

Today, the Federation announced it had received a sizeable quantity of debris. In a statement, President Hudson expressed his satisfaction at the outcome:

\I would like to thank the galactic community for its enthusiastic participation in the search for Starship One. Thousands of tonnes of debris have been delivered to the Federal research outpost at Leoniceno Orbital, which we will now subject to comprehensive spectral analysis. As for Daurtu Jet Comms PLC, I do not know what interest it has in Starship One, but I would remind them that the Federation takes a dim view of those who meddle in its affairs.\

Although Daurtu Jet Comms PLC offered larger rewards for wreckage than the Federation, it is understood to have received only a modest amount of space-borne debris. Given the failure of the organisation's appeal, we may never know why Daurtu Jet Comms PLC was looking for the lost presidential ship.


* Galactic News: Empire to Retake Facece
A little over two weeks ago, the Facece system was occupied by an independent faction known as the Allied Facece Order. The news sent shockwaves through the Empire, with many asking how such a small organisation could take control of the second most important system in Imperial space. The consternation felt by Imperial citizens was compounded by the Empire's apparent lack of urgency regarding the issue, with many directing their frustration at Chancellor Anders Blaine, who was until recently the system's primary administrator.

Colm Tornquist of the Imperial Herald seemed to encapsulate the views of many when he asked: \What is Chancellor Blaine waiting for? Every day that passes is another day in which the people of Facece labour under the dictatorial rule of the Allied Facece Order. Action must be taken!\ Almost as soon as this complaint was aired, Clearly Chancellor Blaine announced plans to retake the Facece system:

\I apologise for what some have perceived as a lack of alacrity. I know the Imperial people are eager to see these opportunists removed from Imperial space, but it was essential that we plan our operation carefully to minimise the danger to the people of Facece. Now the planning is over, and order will soon be restored. I implore the people of Facece to remain calm. And to the Allied Facece Order I say this: your days are numbered.\


* Community Goal: Manufacturer Appeals for Osmium
The LHS 2936 Alliance Combine, a manufacturing concern based in the LHS 2936 system, has issued a galaxy-wide request for osmium. According to a company spokesperson, the rare metal will be used to create specialist alloys with which to improve the organisation's manufacturing facilities. The organisation has promised to reward contributors with discounts at the Fraser Orbital shipyard in addition to liberal financial reimbursements.

The company's spokesperson gave a statement to the media:

\It is no secret that our share price dipped recently, but we are confident that with the requisite materials we will be able to regain our competitive edge. That's why we're offering generous incentives to pilots who deliver osmium to our base of operations at Fraser Orbital.\

The campaign begins today and is expected to run for one week.


* Community Goal: Former Slaves in Need
Recent reports from LFT 37 indicate that the system could be on the brink of a humanitarian crisis. According to system authorities, the issue began when the Paladin Consortium took control of the starport of Onnes Gateway and liberated all the imperial slaves at the starport. Unfortunately, however, the process of officially terminating the slaves' contracts has become entangled in bureaucratic red tape, and this has put the former slaves in a difficult position, as they cannot yet legally obtain housing or employment.

In light of this development, the Paladin Consortium has issued a galaxy-wide request for water purifiers to ensure the former slaves have access to basic sanitation while awaiting their 'official' release. The faction has promised to reward any pilots who contribute to the initiative.

A spokesperson for the Paladin Consortium released a brief statement to the media:

\The Paladin Consortium is spearheading a humanitarian initiative to bring essential supplied to thousands of slaves in the LFT 37 system. But we cannot do this alone, so we are turning to the galactic community for support.\


* Galactic News: Focus on Democracy
This weekly roundup highlights some of the minor factions pursuing the dream of democratic freedom by holding elections.

Here are 10 of the 3,157 minor factions holding elections:

Omagatae Liberals

Aisling's Angels

Purple Public Corp.

Orerve Universal Limited

LFT 90 Regulatory State

Belianses aristocrats

HIP 26890 Comms Systems

Tao Tzaka Corp.\t

Carpaka Holdings

HIP 32350 Industries

Elections occur when two minor factions of a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Emperor's Dawn Shadow Cells Destroyed
Imperial Senator Denton Patreus has confirmed that the Emperor's Dawn 'shadow' cells discovered two weeks ago in the Dakshmandi, Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems have been destroyed. Thousands of independent pilots responded to the senator's call to arms, resulting in the total destruction of what are thought to be the last remaining Emperor's Dawn outposts. Following the victory, Senator Patreus released a statement to the media:

\The galactic community has once again shown that it will not let itself be cowed by extremists. To all those who contributed to this campaign, I wish to offer my sincerest gratitude. I know that in the past I have been guilty of prematurely dismissing Emperor's Dawn, but on this occasion I think we can safely say that this insurgent organisation, which has tried so hard to undermine our way of life, is no more.\

The battle was viewed rather differently outside the Empire, however, with one commentator stating:

\The Imperial propaganda machine would have you believe the Empire won by a landslide, but the truth is they had to work hard for victory.\


* Galactic News: Imperial Inquisition's Campaign Successful
Mavia Kain, leader of the Imperial Inquisition, has announced that the group's campaign to develop the planetary outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1 has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Members of the organisation were motivated to launch the campaign after becoming frustrated with i Sola Prospect's limited service options. Having received significant quantities of material, the organisation is now in a position to begin developing the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a statement to the media:

\Mavia Kain and the Imperial Inquisition would like to thank the galactic community for its support. Thanks to you, i Sola Prospect will soon be the best-equipped planetary outpost in the galaxy, rivalled only by Jameson Memorial.\

Improvements to the outpost are expected to begin immediately.


* Powerplay: Weekly Report
Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon did not have the opportunity to sign new trade agreements this week. Pending the conclusion of negotiations in Ross 842 and HIP 55118, the Alliance trade network will encompass an impressive 90 centres. Authorities in HIP 73269 have invited Alliance delegates to discuss the possibility of establishing another trade hub in the system.

Federal President Zachary Hudson sent Federal security task forces into the Detta, Dongkum, and HIP 24046 systems this week, ultimately establishing a permanent presence for Federal fleets in all three systems. Federal fleets have also surged into Carpaka and LPM 229. If a military presence is established in these additional systems, President Hudson will control a total of 81 naval bases.

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters was unable to secure support in the Amuzgo system this week, but the coming week holds opportunities for the Shadow President in the Sawali and Chi'iang Fei systems. Extensive aid campaigns are underway, demonstrating the capabilities of Federal welfare and healthcare programmes. Should these systems join Felicia Winters, she will be the power of choice in a total of 69 systems.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny Duval has recovered from her resource shortfalls, netting a vast reserve of capital to finance the expansion of the Shield of Justice. Waimiri is currently playing host to the Shield of Justice, and leveraging the fleet to rid the system of criminal activity.

Princess Aisling Duval had a mixed week, as the HIP 116045 system terminated its support for the People's Princess, and Kuki An and Nyalayan joined her cause. No new systems are expected to join her cause next week, but Aisling's publicity teams are reportedly planning to unleash a media blitz in a fortnight.

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval was able to return her enterprises to a state of financial solvency this week, and to acquire a majority share in the infrastructure in the Yakama system. The profitability of her business has allowed the senator to begin looking for new investment opportunities, and she is expected to make new acquisitions in the coming weeks.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was able to accumulate a large reserve of credit through shrewd investment this week, meaning he will be able to extend offers to businesses in the Polecteri, Pukkeitsi, and Kwaritreni systems next week. Negotiations in Hyldeptu and LP 711-32 are expected to conclude by next Thursday. Should the negotiations conclude in Sirius' favour, Sirius Gov will hold controlling interests in a total of 56 systems.

Simguru Pranav Antal secured another system this week as violent protests in the Kenna system were decisively ended. Utopian ambassadors have negotiated to establish enclaves in the Taosha and Sukree systems, but opposition to the Utopian presence has led to fierce protests in these systems. Should Antal's forces prevail, Utopia could grow to encompass a total of 51 key systems.

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus concluded the sale of arms to 23 Delta Piscis Austrini this week, and his fleets have already begun moving into the system. But resistance to the presence of Patreus' fleets has solidified, and fighting has broken out in several locations in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew withdrew from the He Xians, Brynhilo and Bhattra systems following last week's uprisings. After months of subjugation and exploitation, the populace has now adopted a defensive stance in the hope of preventing possible re-conquest. Archon has additional uprisings to deal with this week, but with his forces now more concentrated, it is unlikely he will give further ground.

* Freelance Report: Detail of Dr Arcanonn Death Threats Revealed
Nelson De Rosa, chief of security for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has released a statement to the media:

\Dr Arcanonn has been receiving threats from crackpots for months, but this time the threat was more credible: that if he visited Professor Palin in Maia he would be 'terminated'. A meeting between the two scientists had indeed been planned, but was not common knowledge.\

\We've now determined that Socha Korbemile, the doctor's research assistant, had been leaking sensitive information to an unknown source for some time. We are now probing possible links to Varati-based groups that have previously obstructed our research, and to the intruders who infiltrated Christian Dock in November last year.\

\We are also looking for Dr Huros, whose militant views on alien life have previously brought him into conflict with Dr Arcanonn. I want to eliminate him from our investigation as soon as possible, so I would appreciate any information on his whereabouts.\

* Noticias de la comunidad: Nuevos avistamientos de la Diamondback
Tras el informe de Obsidian Orbital emitido hace unos d\u00edas en el que se informaba de una Diamondback Explorer que fue observada escaneando la estaci\u00f3n, han empezado a aparecer m\u00e1s noticias de avistamientos. Un piloto llamado Comandante Doumaz_B afirm\u00f3:

\Acabo de ver una de esas extra\u00f1as Diamondbacks dando vueltas en c\u00edrculo en torno a Zenbei Orbital en Vaka. Estaba volando lateralmente, encarando siempre a la estaci\u00f3n y no ten\u00eda ninguna se\u00f1al que poder fijar. Intent\u00e9 seguirla en mi Correo Imperial pero era demasiado r\u00e1pida. La segu\u00ed por unos momentos y de repente... desapareci\u00f3\.

La mayor\u00eda de los avisos de avistamiento son obviamente falsos, pero algunos de ellos podr\u00edan ser leg\u00edtimos. La brevedad de estos elusivos encuentros y la falta de datos ver\u00eddicos hacen dif\u00edcil atribuir esa nave a ninguna organizaci\u00f3n conocida.

A la vista de estos avisos, muchos sistemas han decidido poner sus fuerzas de seguridad en alerta.

* Galactic News: Ishmael Palin to Depart for Maia b1ba
It has been several weeks since Professor Ishmael Palin, the scientist researching the Unknown Artefacts, appealed for help in establishing a new research outpost on Maia b1ba. The appeal was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge influx of deliveries to Obsidian Orbital, Professor Palin's base of operations. But since then there has been no news about the new research base, prompting some to wonder if it would in fact materialise.

In a statement released today, Professor Palin explained the reasons for the hold-up, and reassured the public that the research base would go ahead:

\I know the galactic community is eager to unravel the mystery of the Unknown Artefacts. The fact is that my team and I were sidetracked by our recent breakthroughs with the UAs and meta-alloys. I can assure the public, however, that the new research outpost will go ahead \u2013 in fact, my team and I will be departing for Maia b1ba imminently.\

The professor's ship, containing a wealth of valuable research material, is expected to set off in the next 24 hours.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 12,567 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Kunie Future

Bulgarlmadi Incorporated

Sopdet Imperial Society

Labour of Uadjiru

HIP 4003 Empire League

Purple Major Commodities

New HIP 20869 Defence Force

Cemiess Inc

Avan Law Party

Gondul Empire Group

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 576 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

Labour of Cernobog

Malloc Law Party

Integrated Gundiae

Brotherhood of Guathiti\t

Drug Empire of Apam Napat

Evejitaka Liberals

United Xuanduna Resistance

Dragons of Nastrond

Laedla Netcoms Systems

Independents of Udihikoja

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Professor Ishmael Palin Missing
Authorities in the Maia system have reported that Professor Ishmael Palin, the scientist conducting research into the Unknown Artefacts, has disappeared. The professor recently announced plans to set up an independent research outpost on the planet Maia b1ba, but it has now been confirmed that the ship carrying Palin and his team did not reach its destination. Seneca Toule, a security officer based in Maia, released a brief statement to the media:

\Professor Palin's ship transmitted a status report not long after it left Obsidian Orbital, but since then no further reports have been received. All attempts to contact the vessel have been unsuccessful. A search is underway, however, and I am confident we will soon find some indicator of what has happened to Professor Palin and his team.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Security Digest

Coalition of Bembarriosk

Ross 23 Incorporated

Miribusha Fortune and Co

Traditional LP 417-213 Conservatives

Ruchbah Progressive Party

United Nedos League

Bureau of Aulis

FF Andromedae Boys

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 961 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Calor First

Neperimpox Jet Fortune Ind

HIP 110127 Empire Pact

NLTT 44958 Energy Group

LHS 2936 Network

Kaushpoos Pro-Alliance Union

New Taosha League

Workers of Ross 162 Alliance

Mebekre Group

Dukes of HIP 14684

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Community Goal: Develop the Economy of Okinura
Following recent reports that the Earth Defence Fleet, a Federation-aligned faction, had assumed control of the Okinura system, the organisation has announced plans to develop the system's economy. In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:

\Okinura has been marked for development due to its strategically significant position between the systems of Federal President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters. By transforming Okinura into a high-tech system we hope to create a valuable trading hub and give a boost to the wider Federal economy.\

In support of this goal, the Earth Defence Fleet has devised a two-pronged strategy, placing an open order for polymers with which to upgrade Fisher Terminal, and setting aside privateer bonds for combat pilots who help to eliminate agitators operating in Okinura.

The initiative begins today and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: Appeal for Osmium Successful
The LHS 2936 Alliance Combine has announced that its recent campaign for osmium has been a success. According to a company spokesperson, the osmium will be used to create specialist alloys with which to improve the organisation's manufacturing facilities, thereby helping the company regain its competitive edge. In a statement, the company's spokesperson thanked those who had responded to the request:

\We would like to extend our gratitude to all the pilots who contributed to this campaign by delivering osmium to our base of operations at Fraser Orbital. The process of manufacturing the specialist alloys needed to improve our manufacturing facilities has now begun. A new era of profitability for the LHS 2936 Alliance Combine lies ahead.\


* Freelance Report: Diamond Frogs Bring Hope to LFT 37
An initiative by the Paladin Consortium to deliver water purifiers to recently liberated imperial slaves in LFT 37 has been declared a rousing success, due in part to the actions of the Diamond Frogs private security firm.

Diamond Frog pilots were hired by the Paladin Consortium to run interference within the system, preventing opportunistic raiders from picking off the cargo vessels making deliveries to Onnes Gateway.

Though there were a few close scrapes, Commander Kermit Laphroaig praised the tenacity of his fellow mercenaries, and reported that despite the overwhelming hostility of the operational area none of his pilots lost their cool in the face of adversity.

* Galactic News: Former Slaves Receive Aid
The Paladin Consortium has announced that its recent appeal for water purifiers has been met with a positive response. The initiative was launched after the group freed the Imperial slaves of LFT 37, only to discover that the newly liberated slaves would not legally be able to obtain employment or housing for several weeks. With a potential humanitarian crisis looming, the Paladin Consortium turned to the galactic community for help, asking for deliveries of water purifiers to ensure the former slaves would have access to basic sanitation.

Following the success of the initiative, authorities in the LFT 37 system released a statement to the media:

\We are immensely grateful to all those who contributed to this campaign. The former slaves at Onnes Gateway will now be able to enjoy a basic standard of living while they wait for the Empire to formally terminate their indenture contracts. Our thanks also go to the Paladin Consortium, which spearheaded this operation.\

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon signed no trade agreements this week, as negotiations with delegates from Ross 842 and HIP 55118 failed to produce satisfactory terms for all stakeholders. New trade agreements with Mong Kung and Picunche are currently being negotiated.

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters secured support from the Sawali system this week, bringing the total number of systems under her control to 68. Ch'iang Fei declined to formally pledge support to the Liberal party. Attempts to secure the support of the Amuzgo and Chukchan systems through focused aid packages are currently in progress.

Federal President Zachary Hudson was faced with resource shortfalls this week, resulting in the abandonment of military operations in Carpaka and LPM 229. President Hudson is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a military presence in the Concantae system, but supply shortages threaten the long-term viability of the Federal fleet in Bandjigali. If supplies remain low, the expansion into Concantae may fail, and Federal fleets may withdraw from Bandjigali.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval encountered supply chain difficulties this week, preventing the Shield of Justice from establishing a presence in Waimiri. The combat readiness of Shield of Justice patrols has been jeopardized in Damoorai, Olelbis and Kappa, and could lead to withdrawal from these systems. If the shortages are resolved, Bragur, Mbutsi, Hrun, Brestla, Kherthaje and HR 4720 could be patrolled by the Emperor's fleets next week.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui approved new Sirius franchises in Hyldeptu this week, bringing the total number of systems in the Sirius portfolio to 55. Business deals are underway in Polecteri and San, and early negotiations have begun in HIP 2778. Things looks good for Sirius.

Princess Aisling Duval's publicity teams unleashed an impressive media blitz this week, spending roughly 8 billion credits to spread the message of the People's Princess. As a result, the citizens of HIP 77470 have expressed interest in supporting Aisling's agenda, which would make HIP 77470 the 63rd system to support the princess's cause.

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval's enterprises are currently well-funded, and the senator is looking into purchasing infrastructure in V2689 Orionis and HR 6948. Both systems could provide unique employment and trading opportunities deep within Federal territory.

Simguru Pranav Antal was unable to secure Taosha and Sukree this week. Violent protests have erupted in HIP 7076 and Gendini, as Utopian agitators attempt to liberate the systems' citizens from the misguided bureaucrats who resist the truth of Utopia.

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus secured harbour for his fleets in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini this week, securing the independent system against future incursions from the Kumo Crew, which attacked the system mere weeks ago. Senator Patreus is also seeking harbour for his fleets in the Contie system, where he recently concluded a sale of arms.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine crushed rebellions in Yuror and Itzanmets, ensuring both systems remained firmly in his grasp. Turmoil within the Kumo Crew has abated, and signs of Kumo Crew activity are already beginning to appear in systems near the borders of the Pirate Lord's domain. Should this activity persist, insurrections could soon take place in Morronii and HIP 111880.

Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has spoken out about the disappearance of Professor Ishmael Palin:

\I hope that the professor is safe, but I feel a growing sense that he is no longer with us. As was recently made public, I am currently in hiding because a credible threat to my life was received. My fear is that the dark forces that sought to end my life have intercepted Palin on his way to Maia b1ba.\

\We were told that the Diamondback Explorer that made the 'high-speed pass' at Obsidian Orbital appeared to be looking for something. Could it have been looking for the professor?\

\We didn't always see eye to eye, but Professor Palin is \u2013 or was \u2013 a great scientist and he is sorely missed.\

* Galactic News: Starship One Destruction Linked to Mechanical Failure
A Federal investigation team has released the results of an official inquiry into the destruction of Starship One. The 600,000-word report confirms that the abnormal energy signature detected just before the ship made its last jump was almost certainly caused by mechanical failure. The report goes on to assert that the failure began with a power surge in the ship's central power plant \u2013 a relatively common occurrence in a high-capacity hydrogen reactor \u2013 which overloaded several other core systems.

Despite examining every piece of available evidence, investigators could not find any proof that the ship was sabotaged. They ultimately concluded that the ship's destruction was the result of a complex, multi-stage engine failure.

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 544 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

Mahei Posse

Huokang Crimson Dynamic Co

Zaonce Jet Gang

14 i Orionis Jet Camorra

Luhman 16 First

Bhumliaurt Blue Brothers

Revolutionary Songbe Green Party

Epsilon Indi Party

Earls of Uzumeru

CU Cancri Purple Brothers

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Galactic News: Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 839 minor factions in lockdown:

Earth Defense Fleet

Jangore Monarchy

League of LP 195-25

Carverda Empire Assembly

Futhorc Imperial Society

Wolf 225 Dominion

Allowa Vision and Co

Bureau of Atropos Conservatives

HIP 12766 Empire Party

Xiri Crimson Public Ltd

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 835 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Liberty Party of Lodhary

Kakmbutan Comms Inc

Sopontet Free

Gabri Labour

Wiknani Blue Transport Solutions

Movement for Inmutha Progressive Party

Rata Bares Empire Group

Dvorsi Empire Assembly

LTT 9810 Citizens' Forum

Wayaliti Independent Consulate

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Galactic News: Prices Rising at i Sola Prospect
Last month, the Imperial Inquisition launched a campaign to develop the outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1. The campaign was a resounding success, making i Sola Prospect the first planetary outpost to boast a complete range of services, including a comprehensive shipyard. But authorities in Brestla have now announced that they intend to increase the cost of services at the state-of-the-art facility \u2013 a decision that is sure to disappoint some sections of the galactic community.

\It costs a lot for manufacturers to ship such large payloads from their core systems\ said a spokesperson, \and unfortunately some of these costs must be passed on to the consumer. We are therefore increasing the prices of all outfitting and shipyard services at i Sola Prospect by 20 per cent. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\

The price increase will be implemented immediately.


* Galactic News: Okinura Appeal Successful
The Earth Defence Fleet has announced that its initiative to develop the economy of the Okinura system has been a resounding success. The organisation devised a two-pronged strategy in support of its goal \u2013 placing an open order for polymers with which to upgrade Fisher Terminal, and setting aside privateer bonds for combat pilots who help to eliminate agitators operating in Okinura. It seems that both operations were enthusiastically received by the galactic community.

As the campaign drew to a close, Shadow President Felicia Winters released a statement to the media:

\I wish to extend my gratitude to the men and women of the Earth Defence Fleet, and to the many independent pilots who supported this initiative. Let this achievement herald the beginning of a new era of prosperity for the people of Okinura.\

The process of upgrading Fisher Terminal is expected to begin soon.


* Community Goal: The Search for Survivors
Federal President Zachary Hudson has confirmed that the remains of Starship One were among the wreckage recently delivered to Leoniceno Orbital. The search for the missing presidential vessel began two weeks ago, resulting in the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of wreckage, which was then subjected to rigorous analysis by Federal scientists. The analysis confirmed that the remains of Starship One had been located, prompting President Hudson to release a statement to the media:

\The loss of Starship One remains a tragedy, but I must admit to feeling a sense of relief at finally knowing what happened to the presidential ship.\

President Hudson followed his statement with a surprising announcement:

\Our researchers have surmised that the destruction of Starship One was not instantaneous, and that the front of the ship may have suffered less damage than the rest of the vessel. This means there is a very small chance \u2013 and I must stress that this is remote \u2013 that some of the crew might have been able to reach escape pods. That's why I'm calling on the galactic community to support a second search \u2013 a search for survivors.\

\Pilots who want to contribute to the search should concentrate their efforts in the Lyncis Sector, and in particular on the ON-T B3-1, ON-T B3-2, ON-T B3-3, ON-T B3-4 and ST-R B4-3 1 systems, where we believe further wreckage from the ship may be found.\

The search is expected to begin immediately.


* Community Goal: Free the Slaves
Princess Aisling Duval has announced the creation of new a colony for former slaves in the Uibuth system. According to a statement from the princess' press liaison, all slaves admitted to the colony will be liberated and re-educated, and offered the protection of forces loyal to Her Royal Highness.

A spokesperson for the Prismatic Imperium, which is overseeing the initiative, revealed more about the historic campaign:

\This morning our most noble lady Princess Aisling Duval returned from Achenar to Cubeo III. Upon arrival she immediately requested a private meeting with the leadership of the Prismatic Imperium. During the meeting, the princess emphasised her enduring wish to bring an end to slavery within the empire.\

\To this end, Princess Duval instructed Lord Corwin Ryan Head of the Prismatic Imperium and Count Vickershaft of the Navigators Guild to make preparations for the founding of a new colony, where freed slaves could live in comfort and safety. With the support of independent factions at D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system, the colony was duly established.\

The spokesperson went on to outline how the galactic community could support the new colony:

\At the behest of the Princess, the Prismatic Imperium is asking pilots to transport slaves of all types to the new colony, where they will be emancipated and re-educated. Significant rewards have been promised to pilots who contribute to the initiative.\

The initiative begins on the 18th of February 3302 and is expected to run for one week.


* Galactic News: Focus on Democracy

Dukes of HIP 7018

Yab Yum Inc

BD+24 1451 Major Corporation

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, and the Alliance as a whole, celebrated the momentous signing of trade agreements in Mong Kung and Pincunche this week. With the finalization of these agreements, the Alliance network boasts a total of 90 influential trade hubs. The overall economic outlook in the Alliance remains the envy of other trade networks.

Federal President Zachary Hudson's fleets easily corrected the supply shortages they were faced with last week, delivering approximately 6.6 billion credits worth of garrison supplies to naval bases throughout the president's sphere of influence. But President Hudson was unable to open a naval base in Concantae due to intense local opposition. The navy is now surveying numerous systems to find suitable accommodation for the burgeoning fleet.

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters was unable to secure the support of the Amuzgo and Chukchan systems through aid packages and Liberal propaganda this week. But efforts to woo the political leaders of Djanharu, Juipedi and HIP 47328 are currently underway. Should these systems become supporters of the Shadow President, the Liberal party will hold sway in a total of 71 key systems.

Princess Aisling Duval secured new supporters in HIP 77470 this week, bringing the total number of systems supporting the People's Princess to 63. Popular support for Princess Aisling is growing in the Ekono system, and it is expected that representatives from Ekono will affirm the system's support of the People's Princess by next Thursday.

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval's attempts to secure a controlling interest in the infrastructures of V2689 Orionis and HR 6948 this week were unsuccessful. With no new acquisitions expected during the coming week, the senator will likely focus her efforts on quashing opposition from political dissidents within her sphere of influence.

SiriusGov CEO Li Yong-Rui suffered setbacks in the Polecteri and San systems this week, preventing Sirius from incorporating the assets of both systems into the Sirius portfolio. Undaunted, Li Yong-Rui is preparing to finalize the purchase of both private and government sectors in the Aranka system during the coming week.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval was faced with continued supply shortages this week, forcing the Shield of Justice to terminate services in Olelbis, Damoorai and Kappa. Garrison supplies were consumed at near-record levels in Namamasairu, Bragit, Yab Camalo, Cibola, Redoneangi, Igal and Kuuku, jeopardizing the ability of the Shield of Justice to maintain adequate security. If the Emperor is forced to withdraw her fleets from all seven systems, her direct influence will extend to only 57 key systems.

Simguru Pranav Antal welcomed the inhabitants of HIP 7076 into the Utopian fold this week, promising the populace a chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity. Utopians also celebrated a significant milestone in the fledgling power's history: Simguru Antal now has Utopian enclaves in 50 systems.

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus secured harbour for his fleets in the Contie system this week, easily overcoming violent opposition from local dissidents. A number of arms deals fell through, however, weakening any plans the senator may have had to expand his influence. The coming week will be characterised by the defensive deployments of Patreus' fleets.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine successfully instigated infighting and violent insurrection in Morronii and HIP 111880 this week, and pirate vessels have been witnessed supporting criminal elements in both systems. The Pirate Lord appears poised to claim new territory mere weeks after he lost control of three systems.

* Galactic News: Denton Patreus Receives Promotion
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has announced that Senator Denton Patreus is to be promoted to Admiral of the Fleet, following his triumph over the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn. In a statement, the Emperor praised Patreus's recent military success:

\Denton Patreus exhibited remarkable resolve in the campaign against Emperor's Dawn, and demonstrated his ability to act with conviction in the face of an often unpredictable enemy. I can think of no more appropriate person to assume command of the Imperial Navy. It is with great pride that I confer upon him the title of Admiral of the Fleet.\

The senator is expected to assume his new role next week following a formal inauguration ceremony on Capitol.


* Galactic News: Emancipation Initiative Successful
The Prismatic Imperium has announced that its initiative to free indentured slaves has been met with an enormously positive response. Hundreds of independent pilots responded to the appeal, delivering slaves to the new colony at D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. All of those admitted to the colony will be officially emancipated, re-educated, and offered the protection of forces loyal to Princess Aisling Duval.

Her Royal Highness, who spearheaded the initiative, released a statement to the media:

\I am delighted with the response to this appeal, which has resulted in the liberation of several million slaves. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to the Prismatic Imperium and the Navigators Guild, who helped to execute this initiative, and to the many independent pilots who supported us. There is still a long way to go to, but I hope this triumph will pave the way for a brighter future. A future in which the practice of slavery is seen for what it is \u2013 a barbaric anachronism.\


* Freelance Report: CIMA Launches Initiative
Benjamin Gorrister, founder of the Carmack Intergalactic Mining Association, has announced an initiative to discover the location of pristine metallic rings. With nearly 300 locations identified so far, the CIMA is currently leading the way in data collection on pristine metallic rings. In a statement, Gorrister said:

\In memory of George Washington Carmack, who triggered the greatest gold rush in human history, we are offering rewards to all Commanders who provide us with the location of new pristine metallic rings. Each new discovery will be rewarded with 100,000 credits. We will give an additional 30 million credits to the pilot contributing the most information, 20 million credits to the second-place contributor, and 10 million credits to the third-place contributor. May the best prospector win!\

The event will run for 42 days, starting on the 21st of February 3302.

* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 12,191 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Regir Boys

New 15 Lambda Aurigae Revolutionary Party

Amun Public Co

Polevnic Blue Universal Inc

Hurukuntak Company

Hermoduroua Incorporated

New Meliae Flag

6 Andromedae Order

Noatiaca Public Limited

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 524 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

United Epsilon Indi Flag

Erh Lohra Crew

BD-02 4304 Jet Drug Empire

Ross 720 Crimson Cartel

Gridge Public Group

Jupalo Purple Boys

People's Urvane Labour

Mahei Posse

HR 8170 Blue General Commodities

Liberals of Wolf 287

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Freelance Report: Barnacles Continue to Occupy the Canonn
Verity Gavroche, public correspondent for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has been speaking to Dr Arcanonn about his teams' ongoing research:

\I realise the public might think our research has stopped because the barnacles and the Unknown Artefacts have not been in the news, but I can assure you that we are still hard at work. Many Commanders have undertaken expeditions to distant nebulae in the hope of uncovering more barnacles. We've also been working hard to map all the barnacle sites in the Pleiades. In fact, a new site was recently discovered on Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16 C4.\

\We are also trying to understand why the barnacles appear in the Pleiades. Are the raw materials in the nebulae important for their growth? Perhaps the ancient cloud the Pleiades is moving through has long held the 'seeds' for Barnacle growth, and they've only now taken root? We don't know, but we will continue our research.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Galactic News: Remarkable Response to Federal Campaign
Federal President Zachary Hudson has announced that the search for survivors from Starship One has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response. Mere hours after the campaign began, thousands of escape pods had been delivered to Leoniceno Orbital, many of them containing living survivors. In the wake of the initiative's success, President Hudson released a statement to the media:

\I have been overwhelmed by the response to this campaign, which has resulted in the rescue of thousands of individuals, and I am delighted to confirm that some of the recovered pods are indeed from Starship One. We are not yet in a position to release the identities of those we have rescued, but we hope to be able to do so soon. In the meantime I would once again like to extend my gratitude to those who contributed to the search.\

The recovery of so many escape pods will almost certainly prompt speculation that former Federal president Jasmina Halsey may be among the survivors.


* Freelance Report: Miraculous Rescue
In a system near the NGC 1333 nebula, over 1,000 light years from the nearest starport, a pilot by the name of Commander Santander has reported discovering two occupied escape pods. The Commander was surveying a previously uncharted system and cruising near the surface of a rocky-ice body when the readings were detected. The crash site could be clearly seen from high altitude, so Santander went to investigate in his SRV. Fortunately, his Asp Explorer was equipped with a cargo rack.

In a transmission, the Commander said: \I don't know how long they've been on this rock, or if the pods are working. I can't do much for them here \u2013 my ship is fitted for exploration, not search and rescue. I'll get them to port and let someone else open them up.\

* Galactic News: Technological Plague Continues to Threaten Starports
It has been over a month since personnel at Obsidian Orbital reported that meta-alloys had been used to alleviate the starport's ongoing technical issues. Since then, there has been widespread speculation that the meta-alloys might hold the key to eradicating the technological plague that has blighted so many starports in recent months. But the only attempt to verify the theory was brought to an abrupt end with the mysterious disappearance of Professor Ishmael Palin, who had been researching the meta-alloys.

A member of the technical team at Irens Dock in the Manite system, one of the latest starports to experience technical issues, commented on the situation:

\When I heard the news from Obsidian Orbital I expected people to start taking meta-alloys to the other affected starports, but that hasn't happened. Maybe people are being cautious - after all, we don't know for sure that the meta-alloys can help. But if you ask me, it's worth a shot.\

The latest data on affected starports follows.

Starports where services have been suspended:

Ackerman Market, Eravate

von Bellingshausen Port, Almar

Haack Gateway, Halbangaay

Gabriel Enterprise, Harma

Gurragchaa Gateway, Warkushanui

* Freelance Report: Emancipation Initiative Inadvertently Stimulates Slave Trade
Princess Aisling Duval's recent emancipation effort has been criticised following revelations that over seven million slaves were purchased directly from slavers in the systems surrounding Uibuth. These purchases were made by independent traders supporting the princess's liberation programme.

One Commander, who refused to take part in the programme, said: \I can't see how funding slavers is going to stop the slave trade, unless Aisling expects them to retire now they're wealthy.\

Commander Dissident Smith


* Freelance Report: Dr Lorax Speaks for the Barnacles
Doctor Elana Lorax, a leading contributor in the field of xeno biology, has released a statement to the media:

\Before we reached for the stars we destroyed countless species on our homeworld. Similarly, the colonization of Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Achenar and many other systems resulted in the mass extinction of native life.\

\But humanity has yet to learn its lesson. The cry for meta-alloys is not unlike the lust for beaver-pelt top hats in ancient times. Thousands of barnacles have been destroyed, and for what? Defunct stations can be replaced. If the barnacles are destroyed for their meta-alloys we will lose their secrets forever.\

Doctor Lorax continued: \With a little patience we could unlock the secrets of the barnacle. Xeno biologists and chemists could learn to synthesize meta-alloys, given time. Unfortunately it seems humanity is going to destroy another unique lifeform for short-term, and short-sighted, gain.\

* Community Goal: Clean up Orulas
For years, the sparsely populated Orulas system has been dominated by the Orulas Blue Hand Gang, a ruthless criminal organisation. This cold-blooded band has been making life intolerable for the system's inhabitants, but the local government appears reluctant to take a stand. Some have speculated that this is because the authorities receive regular kickbacks from the criminals.

But one resident has had enough. Rose Trebek, a former soldier and veteran of countless military campaigns, has established a defence initiative to clean up Orulas \u2013 the Joint Security Taskforce.

\I'm sick of these scumbags running my system,\ said Trebek, \and I'm sick of the government looking the other way. It's time to take care of these punks. But we can't do it alone.\

\Our intelligence indicates that the Blue Hand is ferrying its spoils in big convoys to various fences. They trade mostly in escape pods, which they sell to shady pseudo-scientific outfits conducting illegal human experiments. We need pilots to swoop in, bust open the convoys, and recover as many pods as they can. We also need volunteers to sweep the system, taking out any Blue Hand ships they encounter. That should make things easier for the Commanders targeting the convoys.\

Trebek has the resources to offer generous incentives to those who support the campaign. But she has stressed that the operation will not be straightforward:

\If you're not an experienced combat pilot, frankly you can't help us. These Blue Hand dirtbags are the real deal. I don't want your death on my conscience.\

The campaign begins on the 25th of February 3302 and will run for one week.Pilots who want to participate are advised to make their way to Wilkes Orbital in the Nespeleve system.


* Community Goal: Campaign to Construct New Starport in LHS 3447
LHS 3447 is familiar to many independent pilots, being a popular starting point for those embarking on careers as traders, bounty hunters and explorers. But many of these pilots have bemoaned the relative inaccessibility of the system's starports.

The Pilots Federation, in association with LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co, has announced plans to address the issue by constructing a new Orbis starport in LHS 3447. According to a spokesperson for the organisation, the new starport will orbit LHS 3447 B 1 a, making it particularly valuable to miners exploiting the LHS 3447 AB belt.

\The Pilots Federation is all about building a better future for the people who keep the galaxy moving. This new starport will give those people a valuable new trade and resupply hub, in addition to giving the system's economy a boost.\

The campaign to construct the starport, which will be named 'Bluford Orbital', begins on the 25th of February 3302 and will run for two weeks. Pilots who want to support the first phase of the campaign are invited to deliver metals to Worlidge Terminal in LHS 3447.


* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Responds to Plea for Meta-Alloys
Responding to the suggestion that more meta-alloys be shipped to stations experiencing technical issues, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has issued a statement:

\Many teams from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group have already started collecting meta-alloys. Some have been doing so for many days. But one thing bothers me. The community painstakingly collected and shipped thousands of tonnes of meta-alloys to Obsidian Orbital for Professor Palin. Where did they go? Surely the engineering teams at Obsidian Orbital didn't use them all up?\

\I want to urge personnel at Obsidian Orbital to help us by releasing their remaining stock of meta-alloys to the commodities market. Once the existing supply runs out, we will return to the barnacle sites to collect more.\

\Since one of the affected stations is in my home system, I'm as eager as everyone else to deal with these malfunctions. It seems we have the means to fix the problems, so let's do it.\

* Galactic News: Former Federal President Found
The recent Federal operation to search for survivors from Starship One was eagerly supported by the galactic community, resulting in the safe recovery of thousands of escape pods, many of them containing living survivors. As the task of identifying the pod's occupants continues, Federal President Zachary Hudson has made a surprising announcement: one of the escape pods taken to Leoniceno Orbital contains former Federal president Jasmina Halsey.

\When we started searching for the remains of Starship One it was with the aim of discovering what happened to the ship. I never imagined we would find survivors, and certainly not that one of them would be Jasmina Halsey.\

Asked about Halsey's condition, Hudson said:

\The medical team at Leoniceno has described Halsey's condition as critical but stable. It appears her escape pod was damaged and she sustained some injuries, so she's being kept in an induced coma until her wounds have healed. This is likely to take weeks. If her condition changes I will be immediately notified.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This weekly transmission lists some of the systems currently in conflict around the galaxy, based on the latest data.

Here are 10 of the 15,698 minor factions involved in a civil war:

HR 2622 Co-operative

Hurusalki Jet Netcoms Company

United Hurusalki Independents

Social Zapakhere Future

Zapakhere Party

Kokaangin Blue Natural and Co

United Kokaangin Movement

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 7,061 minor factions at war:

Revolutionary UGP 145 Free

Uhlan Blue Public PLC

Confederacy of HIP 82088

HIP 82738 Syndicate

Ba Nefes Empire Party

Cliocassi One

LHS 3295 Legal Holdings

Baltah'Sine Unionists

LHS 229 Electronics PLC

Andhrimi Crimson Travel PLC

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

* Galactic News: The Mysterious Case of the Disappearing Meta-Alloys
Last month, the eminent scientist Ishmael Palin issued an appeal for meta-alloys, the rare material produced by the 'barnacles' of the Pleiades Nebula. The request was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, but the professor's research into the meta-alloys was brought to an abrupt halt when he and his team disappeared en route to Maia b1ba.

Since then, certain sections of the galactic community have raised questions over just what has happened to these meta-alloys. Many cited the tremendous effort involved in collecting and transporting the materials, and some have even called for them to be made available on the Obsidian Orbital commodities market.

Authorities at Obsidian Orbital have not yet commented on the situation, but an anonymous report has emerged that appears to shed some light on the situation:

\The truth is that most of the meta-alloys were sold on the black market to various private companies. It seemed a little weird to me, so I did some digging and found out that almost all the companies were fronts for some big conglomerate I'd never heard of. I don't know what they plan to do with the meta-alloys, but I thought the public should know.\

The legitimacy of the report has not yet been confirmed, but if it is genuine, it raises the questions of who purchased the meta-alloys and why.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion List
Each week, GalNet presents a list of 10 of the 1,210 minor factions currently expanding into new systems.

Justice Party of Anekaliti

Movement for Villeachi Independents

Independents of Parenni

* Galactic News: Presidential Vessel Retired
For the past six years, the Federation has used a pair of customised Saud Kruger Narwhal Liners (upgraded variants of the successful Beluga Liner) as the personal vessels of the Federal president. Last year, one of these vessels was lost in a tragic accident. Today, the remaining vessel will be retired.

Bexley Jones, a spokeswoman for President Zachary Hudson, said: \It is of the utmost importance that the ship bearing the callsign 'Starship One' can function as a mobile base of operations for the president, providing him with everything he needs while off-planet, in addition to offering total safety. Given the Beluga's primary designation as a passenger vessel, we have decided that it is unable meet these demands.\

Jones confirmed that the remaining Narwhal will be replaced with a pair of modified Farragut Battle Cruisers, a mainstay of the Federal Navy. The formidable vessels are equipped with an extensive array of heavy weaponry, and are capable of transporting multiple Federal Corvettes and a large F63 Condor squadron. \In these dangerous times, it is essential that the presidential vessel be able to offer comprehensive military support, and the Farragut Battle Cruiser can do just that,\ said Jones.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

* Community Goal: Conspiracy Theorist Appeals for Cartographic Data
Notorious conspiracy theorist Ricardo Bentonio has issued an appeal for cartographic data with which to substantiate an extraordinary claim. According to a recent press statement, Bentonio has unearthed ancient records that prove the 29th of February 3302, which appears on all galactic calendars, should not exist. He has convinced Kruger 60 Free to fund the one-day appeal, believing that the cartographic data will prove him correct.

Bentonio elaborated on his theory at a press conference:

\We're not just talking about computers shutting down or ship systems failing. We're talking about the end of life as we know it! We're talking about the very fabric of space-time collapsing in on itself, and the entire universe coming to an end!\

Despite Bentonio having been widely derided as a tin foil hat-wearing crackpot, it's likely that the financial incentives he is offering will earn him some support. Pilots who want to contribute to the initiative are invited to deliver cartographic data to Jones Estate in the Groombridge 34 system on the 29th of February 3302.


* Galactic News: Conspiracy Theorist's Appeal Ends
Kruger 60 Free has announced that the galactic community has responded with surprising enthusiasm to the recent appeal from conspiracy theorist Ricardo Bentonio. Hundreds of pilots chose to support Bentonio's campaign, bringing him cartographic data so he could prove that the 29th of February 3302 was an 'aberrant day' heralding the imminent collapse of the universe.

Although no indications of universal catastrophe have been reported, Bentonio still appears to believe that the irregular day is a harbinger of humanity's impending doom:

\It will happen \u2013 you mark my words! This day is an anomaly, and should never have been. It's the end!\

At the time of writing, the universe continues to exist.


* Freelance Report: Presidential Fleet Upgrade Questioned
Following the recent retirement of the last Saud Kruger Narwhal from the presidential fleet, critics of the Hudson administration have commented on the decision to make use of two Core Dynamics Farragut-class battle cruisers as presidential transport vessels.

In an interview with the Federal Times, Congresswoman Kristine Lasky said: \These aren't industry-standard ships that can be purchased on the market. These are mainline warships \u2013 the largest in the Federal Navy's inventory. That the president intends to make use of not one but two of these ships should seriously concern taxpayers.\

\Is it necessary for the president to deploy a battle group every time he visits a foreign dignitary? What message does that send to other heads of state? It looks less like a matter of security and more like a show of force!\

Congresswoman Lasky announced that she will call upon the Federal Accountability Office to investigate the acquisition and deployment cost to the taxpayer, and put forward a measure to limit the president's use of the ships to a handful of occasions per fiscal year.

Here are 10 of the 679 minor factions in lockdown:

Ix Chim Jet Life Ltd

Arabrigur Emperor's Grace

Hou Mayo Patron's Principles

Traditional LP 245-17 Law Party

Natural BD-00 4461 Constitution Party

Gang of Wolf 12

Independents of Arimil

LTT 10462 Crimson Advanced Co

Nommarini Organisation

Barons of Miki

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 674 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Menambe Blue Posse

Kartamayana Fortune Services

Caraswang Gold Public Inc

Crimson Comms Limited

Binjia Incorporated

Bunuson Empire League\t

10 Iota Cygni Values Party

Left Party of Akualanu

Partnership of Taribes

BD+59 1851 Resistance

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

* Freelance Report: Canonn Scientist Requests Meta-Alloys
Professor D Luffy, head of research at Bond Hub in the Varati system, has released a statement about the station's need for meta-alloys:

\My researchers are ready to receive as many meta-alloys as the community can deliver. We're certain we can repeat the success of the Obsidian Orbital engineers and reverse the malfunctions plaguing so many stations in the bubble.\

\My colleagues and I understand the concerns about harvesting meta-alloys from the barnacles, but this plague is affecting millions of people and it seems the meta-alloys have been given to us specifically as a cure.\

\We do not condone the destruction of barnacle sites, and we are prepared for the possibility that something bad could happen as a result of using the meta-alloys in this way, but we must balance the need for caution against the needs of humanity. So, please, bring your meta-alloys to us and let us do the rest.\

* Community Goal: Lave Radio Appeals for Blood Crystals
The Lave Radio Network has launched a campaign to construct a new transmitter relay in the Diso system. John Stabler, Head of Operations at Lave Station, said:

\We were performing scheduled maintenance when we discovered that our interstellar transmitter was broken. Very broken. It seems most of the components had been scavenged by raiders, or taken home by staff, or something.\

\Unfortunately we can't afford real estate in the Lave system,\ explained Commander Jarvis, head of station entertainment at the Lave Radio Network. \It's wonderful that the Lave system is free from dictatorship these days, but territory used to be a lot more affordable. Now scalpers and investors have the best of it. Nevertheless, we're very glad for this opportunity to foster a relationship with the\u2026*sigh*...Diso system.\

The Lave Radio interstellar transmitter system uses powerful focusing crystals found only in the Cherbones system. These blood crystals are extremely rare, and are extracted via a highly dangerous mining operation. Lave Radio's second technician \u2013 a former Cherbones Mining Authority employee \u2013 spoke fondly of his first assignment:

\Those were happy times. There was a fair amount of injury, but what posting doesn't have its share of dangers? I mean, everything's dangerous in space: gantries, zoological laboratories, airlocks, vending machines \u2013 everything.\

The Lave Radio Network has asked the galactic community to deliver as many blood crystals as possible to Lave Station in the Lave system for the new interstellar transmitter. The campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will finish immediately.


* Community Goal: Protect Traders in LHS 3447
The campaign to construct a new starport in the LHS 3447 system has been eagerly received by the galactic community, but recent reports indicate that the traders delivering metals for use in the construction project are being targeted by marauders. To protect these pilots, the Pilots Federation, in association with LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co, has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system. A spokesperson for the Pilots Federation issued a brief statement:

\We will not tolerate any harassment of those who have chosen to support this campaign. We are therefore offering generous bounties on all wanted vessels found disturbing the peace in LHS 3447.\

The campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3302 and will run for one week. Pilots who want to help are invited to hand in bounties at Worlidge Terminal in LHS 3447. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Orulas Campaign Reaches an End
Rose Trebek, leader of the Joint Security Taskforce, has announced that the operation to clean up the Orulas system has been an overwhelming success. According to Trebek, hundreds of combat pilots supported the initiative to disrupt the operations of the criminal Blue Hand Gang.

Trebek released a statement to the media in the wake of the campaign's success:

\We had two primary objectives: to clear the spaceways of Orulas, and to liberate the escape pods the criminals were transporting through the system. Thanks to the many brave combat pilots who supported the initiative, both objectives were successfully completed. The recovered escape pods have been delivered to Wilkes Orbital, and the occupants will now be returned to their families.\

Asked about the system's future, Trebek was characteristically pragmatic:

\The pilots who contributed to this initiative have done an outstanding job, but the Blue Hand Gang hasn't been completely destroyed. We've won the battle, but the war is far from over.\

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
This weekly report summarises the recent actions of the galaxy's movers and shakers in Federal, Imperial, Alliance and Independent spheres of influence.

The Federation

Last week was a sweeping success for the Federation. Fleets under the command of President Zachary Hudson exerted massive efforts in Adan, Carpaka, Concantae and LPM 229, successfully establishing a semi-permanent presence in all but Adan. Shadow President Felicia Winters finally claimed new supporters in Amuzgo, a system with which she has repeatedly attempted to curry favour, but her bid to secure support in the hotly contested DR Crucis system was not successful.

The Empire

The Empire suffered a number of setbacks this week, mostly stemming from the increased Federal presence in Carpaka, Concantae, LPM 229 and Amuzgo. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's influence in dozens of systems diminished as a result of these Federal expansions. Princess Aisling Duval's public relations campaigns in Chnumar and Madngela failed to draw more supporters to her cause, even as the Conii system withdrew its support. Senator Zemina Torval focused on protecting her investments and made no new acquisitions. Senator Denton Patreus's fleets were rebuffed in Neali and HIP 116377, but successfully established a presence in HIP 2239.

The Alliance

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon led the Alliance through another week of relative calm. With last week's dispute in DR Crucis now resolved, Alliance negotiators are taking the first steps to secure a trade agreement with that system.

Independents

The acquisition of the valuable Polecteri system by Sirius Gov, led by CEO Li Yong-Rui, was the highlight of Independent activity this week. A bold attempt from Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew to overthrow LTT 874 was repulsed by Imperial fleets, but the level of criminal activity in the system remained high. Pranav Antal's Utopia focused on establishing an influence in Sukree and Yemotepa, which are currently the site of violent protests incited by Utopian agitators.

Setet Public Exchange

Setet Purple Pirates

Prthautas Jet Crew

HIP 25359 Democrats

HIP 25359 Universal Company

Meene Purple Drug Empire

Meene General Industries

Civil wars involve conflict between minor factions in the same system over ownership of major assets such as starports. During civil wars, only combat missions and activities help bring the conflict to a resolution. Security, development level and standard of living indicators all drop for the duration of the civil war.

Here are 10 of the 7,104 minor factions at war:

Rosmerta Citizens of Tradition

HIP 20924 Labour

Maasates Imperial Society

Satio Blue State Exchange

Tan'gika Gold Clan

Raidenwitha Defence Force

Halamaitu Jet General and Co

Xiongga Industries

Mirdia United

Belaba Constitution Party

Wars occur when a minor faction invades another star system. For the duration of the conflict, wealth, security and standard of living are all severely impacted. Combat missions and activities determine who wins the war. If no winner emerges, the war ends in a ceasefire.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Professor Ishmael Palin Found
Last week, the Orulas system was the site of a combat operation designed to eliminate the Blue Hang Gang, a ruthless criminal organisation. One of the operation's objectives was to recover the escape pods the criminals were transporting through the system. Thanks to the brave pilots who supported the initiative, the objective was successfully completed, and the recovered pods were delivered to Wilkes Orbital.

As personnel at Wilkes Orbital continue with the task of identifying the pods' occupants, authorities at the starport have made a surprising announcement: Professor Ishmael Palin and his research team were among those rescued in the operation.

\We were shocked to discover the professor and his colleagues,\ said Governor Lawrence, principal administrator of Wilkes Orbital, \but also delighted. He's in a delicate state at the moment, but we're confident he'll make a full recovery.\

Meanwhile, Rose Trebek, the military veteran who spearheaded the operation against the Blue Hand Gang, was asked how Professor Palin might have ended up in the criminals' custody:

\The Blue Hand are opportunists, so it's hard to imagine them going to the trouble of tracking down Palin and abducting him. My guess is they bought the professor's escape pod from someone else, probably without even knowing who was in it. Hopefully, the professor will be able to tell us more once he's back to full health.\

* Freelance Report: Pleased To Eat You
\We've heard a lot about these barnacles,\ said controversial chef Oliver Gordon today outside his restaurant 'PanGalactic', \but the most important question has yet to be asked. How do they taste?\

\I have sampled delicacies from across the galaxy, including Ceti rabbits and Vacuum krill. Now I seek new flavours with which to tantalize my clientele. I intend to create a dish fit for an emperor: space barnacle broth with a Deuringas truffle oil foam and Ochoeng chilli reduction.\

When asked about the ethics of eating what could be a sentient being, Gordon was dismissive:

\Food is beyond such concerns. There can be no higher honour than to be lovingly prepared by my highly trained master chefs and served to the galaxy's most demanding connoisseurs.\

* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit.

Here are 10 of the 11,071 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom:

Liberty Party of LHS 1788

Mehen Group

Barons of Yerava

Autocracy of StKM 1-1341

Haush Blue Boys

Cempsigi Energy Corporation

Aristocrats of Coriosolite

HIP 22249 Silver Netcoms PLC

HIP 16038 Freedom Party

Traditional Xuane League

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.

Here are 10 of the 479 factions currently experiencing economic bust:

14 i Orionis Jet Camorra

30 Ceti Purple Clan

38 Lyncis Drug Empire

64 Arietis Jet General Solutions

Abukunin Corporation

Aegilakan Crimson Gang

Aleumoxii Purple Brotherhood

Allied Brani First

Allied Kamadhenu Nationalists

Alpha Centauri Advanced Corp.

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Freelance Report: The Only Winners are the Lawyers
Controversial chef Oliver Gordon experienced a different kind of heat today, as he was served with a writ demanding he change the name of his restaurant 'PanGalactic'.

Lawyers for the Pan Galactic Mining Corp told members of the press that: \Our clients want to make clear that this restaurant and its head chef have no connection whatsoever to their corporation. As such, they have served notice regarding the name 'PanGalactic', and will pursue the case vigorously.\

Legal experts are intrigued by the case as it could set a precedent for galaxy-wide intellectual property rights. Professor Janus of the Federal Bar Council ventured that: \It would be an interesting case, if it were heard, although it does highlight the need for more closely aligned intellectual property law.\

It seems Oliver Gordon's no-holds-barred approach to cuisine may have thrown him from the frying pan into the fire.

* Galactic News: Ishmael Palin on the Road to Recovery
Following news that Professor Ishmael Palin was among those rescued in the recent operation against the Blue Hand Gang, medical personnel at Wilkes Orbital have released a statement concerning the professor's current condition:

\The professor has suffered significant mental and physical trauma, and given his age the magnitude of his experience shouldn't be underestimated. But so far he's shown remarkable resilience, and we're confident he'll make a full recovery.\

No information regarding the specifics of Professor Palin's abduction was forthcoming, but it is hoped he will make a full statement soon.


* Galactic News: Lave Radio Campaign Comes to an End
The Lave Radio Network has announced that its campaign to create a new interstellar transmitter has been a resounding success. The galactic community responded enthusiastically to the campaign, delivering large quantities of Cherbones Blood Crystals to Lave Station for use in the new transmitter. In a brief statement, the network extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign:

\We would like to thank all those who responded to our appeal, and helped to keep us broadcasting. We promise to take better care of this transmitter, and not to use its parts to fix the vending machine.\

The Lave Radio Network confirmed that the new transmitter would be operational within a matter of hours.


* Community Goal: Canonn Launches Outpost Campaign
The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has launched a campaign to construct a state-of-the-art research outpost in the Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43 system to support its ongoing research into the Unknown Artefacts. As part of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order for palladium, promising to generously reward pilots who deliver the necessary materials to Thompson Dock in the Varati system.

A spokesperson for the Canonn released a statement to the media:

\Given the failure of Professor Palin's recent attempt to establish a research outpost in the Maia system, I am aware that certain sections of the galactic community may receive our request with scepticism. But the fact is that the study of the Unknown Artefacts is still of great importance, and it is essential that a dedicated research outpost be established, far from the civilian population, where they can be safely investigated.\

The campaign begins on the 10th of March 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Expanding the Federal Fleet
Federal President Zachary Hudson has announced plans to create a new arm of the Federal Navy known as the People's Navy, supported by local corporations rather than Federal taxation. The Navy will be established with a new Farragut Battle Cruiser, to be added to the 54th fleet. The new vessel will be capable of transporting multiple Federal Corvettes in addition to boasting an array of heavy weaponry. Captain G.C. Richards, who is overseeing construction of the new ship, issued a brief statement to the media:

\This new battle cruiser will occupy a significant role in the Federal Navy, strengthening our borders and enhancing the profile of our armed forces. In the interest of completing production as efficiently as possible, we have authorised the Beta Hydri Corporation to reimburse pilots who deliver essential supplies to our base of operations at Stevenson Base. This is an opportunity for those loyal to the Federation to support a vitally important initiative.\

The campaign begins on the 10th of March 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Bluford Orbital Nears Completion
LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co has announced that the campaign to construct a new starport in the LHS 3447 system has reached a successful conclusion. All the necessary materials for the starport have now been received, and the agitators disrupting delivery operations have been neutralised. A spokesperson for the Pilots Federation, which helped to organise the campaign, released a brief statement:

\Once again the galaxy's independent pilots have demonstrated their remarkable commitment and resolve. This new starport will facilitate travel and trade throughout LHS 3447, and serve as a testament to the dedication and altruism of the galactic community.\

Bluford Orbital is expected to open its doors in the next few days.


* Freelance Report: Buckyball Spring Break Controversy
Accusations of reckless endangerment have been levelled at the Buckyball Racing Club regarding its upcoming Spring Break chauffeurs event. Commander Seneh, the event organiser, had this to say:

\This event is a community outreach programme. There will be no 'first place' or prizes. While it is true that the club will give performance scores to participating pilots, those scores will be based on the happiness and safety of the escorted students, not on distance travelled or speed.\

She continued: \All participants are Pilots Federation members, but some are still provisional, myself included! We appreciate that having a documented safety rating from a Grant Academics sanctioned event will help our careers, so we intend to respect our passengers and fly with the utmost care.\

Veteran Buckyball pilots will escort students from the Exigus campus of Grant Academics to the biggest tourism hotspots in the region between the 18th and 26th of March.

* Galactic News: Ishmael Palin Describes Kidnapping
It has now been over a week since Professor Ishmael Palin and his research team were rescued from a criminal syndicate known as the Blue Hand Gang. Since then, there has been considerable speculation about who might be responsible for the abduction. Although the Blue Hand Gang has been known to trade in human cargo, to date it has not been connected to any kidnapping operations. It is therefore assumed that the gang merely purchased Professor Palin and his colleagues from those responsible for the abduction.

With Professor Palin now having made a full recovery, he released a statement concerning the nature of his ordeal:

\To describe the experience as traumatic would be an understatement. One moment our ship was cruising through space, the next, all hell was breaking loose. A klaxon sounded and our vessel banked sharply. Then I heard an explosion and peered out of the viewport just in time to see our escort ships disappear in a ball of flame. It was immediately clear to me that our assailants were no mere pirates. I felt our ship slow and then stop as it was drawn into the belly of our attackers' vessel. Then the hull was carved open and a handful of black-clad figures poured in. I was unconscious within moments.\

\I woke in a darkened room, strapped to a chair. They interrogated me for days, although it was only later that I was able to establish how much time had passed, as it was impossible to keep track of days in my windowless cell. My interrogators were careful never to show me their faces, but I remember the nature of the interrogation clearly enough. Why was I researching the Unknown Artefacts? Who had I shared the information with? I explained that most of what I knew was already a matter of public record, but that did not satisfy them. They were convinced I was withholding something.\

\I soon realised my abductors intended to kill me. Presently I was given an injection, and I felt darkness descend. I assumed I had been poisoned, but I now realise I had simply been given a sedative. The next thing I knew, I was lying in a bed in the medical wing at Wilkes Orbital.\

Professor Palin was asked if he had any theories about who his abductors might be.

\I do not know the name of their organisation, but I know what they represent: control, oppression, and the obviation of civil liberties. Such organisations have existed for millennia - the banner under which they march is immaterial.\


* Freelance Report: Eating Your Words
Controversial chef Oliver Gordon was humiliated yesterday when he lost his battle over the 'PanGalactic' trademark. The cordon bleu has been forced to close his restaurant to meet spiralling legal costs.

The case began when the Pan Galactic Mining Corp issued a writ demanding that Gordon change the name of his 'PanGalactic' restaurant and pay substantial damages for infringing on intellectual property.

A spokesperson for the Pan Galactic Mining Corp released the following statement:

\The Pan Galactic Mining Corp has a right to defend its brand, but we are disappointed that Chef Gordon did not accept our offer to become our preferred catering partner.\

Gordon gave a characteristically colourful response:

\I'm the galaxy's greatest artisan chef and I will not degrade my art for anyone. I'd rather eat a printed hotdog than work for Pan Galactic making sandwiches for business seminars.\

* Freelance Report: Game of Shadows
Various media outlets throughout inhabited space received an anonymous communiqu\u00e9 this morning. \The galactic community is in peril,\ the message began. \They just don't know it yet.\

The transmission asserts a connection between Core Dynamics, the destruction of the Antares and Starship One, the Emperor's Dawn insurgency, and setbacks in Unknown Artefact research. It also claims that the deaths of Federal Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, Sean Richards, Arnold Lowe, Susan Monroe, Elaine Boyd, Emperor Hengist Duval and the disappearances of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey and Professor Ishmael Palin are similarly connected.

The message concluded: \Many of those who have tried to connect these seemingly disparate events have been silenced, along with their sources. That is why I have chosen to remain anonymous. So far, only pawns have been revealed in this shadowy game. We must discover the king.\

Neither the Federation nor the Empire has chosen to comment on the transmission.

* Galactic News: Breakthrough in the Fight against Technological Plague
When Professor Ishmael Palin and his team disappeared en route to Maia b1ba, research into meta-alloys was brought to a near standstill, with only the Canonn Interstellar Research Group continuing to investigate the mysterious material. But recent reports indicate that research has continued in Professor Palin's absence under the helm of Lea Tantaga, a molecular chemist based at Obsidian Orbital.

\We've known for a while that the ongoing technical issues are the result of molecular interference from the Unknown Artefacts,\ said Tantaga. \What we now know is that meta-alloys can be used to neutralise this interference. In their raw form, the meta-alloys aren't all that effective. And the process of using them to create materials that can counter the artefacts' dangerous self-repair mechanism hasn't yet been perfected. But we're definitely on the right path.\

In response to this development, authorities at starports affected by the technological plague have opened their markets to the sale of meta-alloys, no doubt hoping to receive further quantities of the much-needed material and return their outposts to normality. But the harvesting of meta-alloys continues to prove controversial, with some opining that the so-called 'barnacles' from which the materials are derived \u2013 and which are destroyed in the harvesting process \u2013 should be protected.


* Freelance Report: Canonn Scientist Observes Firefly Fandango
Verity Gavroche, official correspondent for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has spoken to Dr Arcanonn about an exciting new discovery:

\Over the weekend I was contacted by a Commander Engalo, who told me he'd observed an interaction between the Unknown Artefacts and the barnacle 'flowers' \u2013 the source of the meta-alloys.\

\Both the barnacles and the artefacts have features we've nicknamed 'fireflies' \u2013 bright specks of light that appear to move of their own volition. Engalo has observed that if you place an artefact near a barnacle, their respective fireflies start flying around together. This continues until the UA is removed.\

\I can't thank Commander Engalo enough for bringing this to my attention. With the new lab the community is helping us build, we'll soon be able to observe this behaviour under controlled conditions.\

* Freelance Report: Federal Investigation into Farragut Mystery
An official inquiry from the Congressional Oversight Committee has been launched after reports surfaced of a pirate-aligned Farragut Battle Cruiser striking out at Federation battle groups in the LHS 3447, Fuleum and HIP 16996 systems. The inquiry will also investigate unconfirmed reports of a rogue battle cruiser outside Federation space in the Maia system.

Speaking under condition of anonymity, a source within the closed-door hearing said: \The scans said it was a Farragut and the Navy said it was a Farragut, but it's not one of ours and it had no clear identification code.\

* Galactic News: Weekly Security Digest
In this weekly report, the latest GalNet data is assembled to present ten minor factions experiencing civil unrest or lockdown in their systems.

Here are 10 of the 584 minor factions in lockdown:

Beetrix Free

Traditional Snoqui Xian Autocracy

Ross 680 Coalition

Apishna Guardians of Tradition

Mangwe Nationals

Fotla Guardians of Tradition

Earls of Adan

Dominion of Mahimata

Fomovithi Corp.\t

G 180-18 Resistance

Lockdowns increase the security rating for a system but also have a negative effect on the system's wealth. Increased bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are 10 of the 598 minor factions experiencing civil unrest:

Social Chandra for Equality

Thotigue Limited

Social Ba Bhuti Coalition

Timocan Prison Colony

Workers of Exbeur Democrats

Abazi aristocrats

United Ugric Coalition

Arabrigur Emperor's Grace

HR 1014 Patron's Principles

Mahin Partners

Civil unrest is caused by illegal activity within the system as well completing contracts from more nefarious sources. The wealth rating and standard of living will suffer when a system contains civil unrest. Combat missions and activities can be utilised to end civil unrest.

Data is correct at time of publishing.


* Galactic News: Could Jasmina Halsey be Reinstated?
Following the extraordinary rescue of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey, whose escape pod was recovered from the wreckage of Starship One, questions have been asked about her possible return to power. According to an anonymous source within the Federal government, several senior-level politicians have voiced the opinion that, should she make a full recovery, Halsey ought to be allowed to serve out the remainder of her term.

Simon Newell, a legal advisor to the Federal government, spoke to the Federal Times earlier today.

 \There's no direct precedent for this situation, so it's hard to be certain. I know some members of government believe Halsey should be reinstated, but my feeling is that such an outcome is unlikely. When Halsey disappeared she was already facing a vote of no confidence, and her presidency was officially terminated so a new president could be elected. My suspicion is that if there were a legal challenge, the law would uphold the vote of no confidence recorded at the time.\


* Freelance Report: End of First Season of Galactic Combat Championship
The first season of the Galactic Combat Championship has come to a spectacular finish. Competitors in the five-week tournament included Adle's Armada, Blood Brothers from Alrai, Ronin of Amarak, Triadius, Contrail, and the Balkan Intergalactic Guerrillas.

Fifteen matches of three rounds were fought every weekend for five weeks, concluding with a spectacular eight vs. eight, winner-take-all match in front of a live audience. Despite many exciting moments, near wins and losses there could be only victor, and that victor was Adle's Armada.

The Armada was a favourite going into the tournament, but few expected them to win every match. The leaders of Adle's Armada gave praise to their competitors: Commanders Poaarctica, Breakfastmelon, Philip J Fry, Truesilver, Finegan, Memoocan, Thatdamnranga and Cosmic Booty.

The second season of the championship is due to start soon, and will is likely feature more groups and match modifiers than the first. Fans of the tournament are already placing bets on the season two winner.

* Freelance Report: More Palladium for Dr Arcanonn
A spokesperson for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has issued a plea for a final push in the campaign to establish a research outpost at Thompson Dock:

\The response from the community has been incredible, but we need more palladium!\

\I know you're tired, but this project is too important for us to give up. I've been living on a particularly strong blend of Varatian coffee, and I understand the local suppliers have made it freely available to all miners. It's great stuff if you don't mind a few heart palpitations.\

\We really want to hit the next milestone so we can get a commodities market at the station. If we can do that, Dr Arcanonn will be able to do what he does best.\

\So please come and mine for the Canonn between now and Thursday afternoon. The rewards are huge, and the camaraderie among the miners is fantastic.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Galactic News: End of the Road for Damon Clarke
When the dissident organisation known as Emperor's Dawn was first brought to public attention, a number of high-profile Imperials were discovered to have connections to the group. One of them was Damon Clarke, a prominent industrialist and a member of Princess Aisling Duval's inner circle. According to a report published by the Imperial Herald, one of Clarke's companies had previously sold weapons to Emperor's Dawn, and the revelation plunged Clarke into scandal.

The prominent patron denied all knowledge of the transaction, but his declarations of innocence were undermined when he fled Imperial space. From that point on, no further information regarding Clarke's whereabouts or actions was released to the public.

But now an undisclosed source, which claims to be close to the Imperial Internal Security Service, has shared news of Clarke's fate. A section of the anonymous message is reprinted below:

\As you know, Clarke fled Imperial space when his connection to Emperor's Dawn was discovered. But he didn't get far. The IISS caught up with him in Apathaam and brought him back to Achenar.

\Clarke was looking at a death sentence, but the IISS offered him a deal: give up his contacts in Emperor's Dawn in exchange for a more lenient sentence. Clarke jumped at the offer, and gave up everyone he knew. His information earned him a commuted sentence: house arrest at his home on Capitol. He even got to keep his car. A pretty good deal.\

\So time passes and Emperor's Dawn gets its ass handed to it by the Empire. But a few of Clarke's former contacts survive, and they're none too happy about him selling them down the river. With IISS agents stationed at Clarke's home, it wasn't easy for them to get to him, but in the end they succeeded. Poisoned his food, I gather. Nasty way to go.\

The Imperial Internal Security Service has declined to comment on the matter.


* Galactic News: New Farragut Battle Cruiser Complete
The Beta Hydri Corporation has announced that the Federal campaign to construct a new Farragut Battle Cruiser is now complete. According to a company spokesperson, the galactic community responded positively to the appeal, resulting in the rapid construction of the new Federal vessel. Captain G.C. Richards, who oversaw the project, released a brief statement to the media:

\The Federation extends its gratitude to all those who supported this initiative. Your hard work has given the Federal Navy a potent new asset.\

Captain Richards went on to single out a pilot by the name of Commander Khemsa, who made the largest single contribution to the initiative. President Hudson has even extended the honour of naming the new ship to Commander Khemsa in recognition of their singular contribution.

The new ship is expected to embark on its inaugural voyage soon.


* Galactic News: Canonn Campaign Comes to an End
The campaign from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group to establish a new research outpost in the Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43 system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering palladium to Thompson Dock, prompting a spokesperson for the Canonn to release a brief statement:

\We are immensely grateful to those who supported this campaign. With more Unknown Artefacts being discovered every day, it is more important than ever that we have access to a dedicated research outpost. Hopefully, the new station will become one of the galaxy's foremost centres for UA research.\


* Freelance Report: Collaborative Effort to Restore Ackerman Market
Ackerman Market in Eravate is just one of the stations affected by the plague. Before it was shut down it was a popular rest stop for Commanders embarking on new careers in space. Just a few days ago its commodities market reopened, and a huge demand for meta-alloys has been reported.

Responding to this, an alliance comprising Commanders Kermit Laphroaig, ThatDamnRanga, Ollobrains, Zenith Ddraiglas and others has formed, which hopes to saturate the market at Ackerman with meta-alloys so the starport can be restored to working order.

A joint statement reads:

\Everyone wants Ackerman online, so we're putting aside our differences to make it happen. We hope Commanders of all allegiances will join us in this collaborative effort, which starts immediately and will run until the station is operational again.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Community Goal: Wilkes Orbital in Need
The normally peaceful Wilkes Orbital has been the focus of considerable attention in recent weeks. First, the starport was at the centre of a campaign to drive the Blue Hand Gang from the nearby Orulas system. Then authorities at the station announced that the escape pods recovered in the operation contained Professor Ishmael Palin and the other members of his research team. Now it seems that the majority of those recovered from the criminals, including Professor Ishmael Palin, have been infected with a strain of Cerberus Plague, the deadly pathogen that claimed millions of lives last year.

Governor Lawrence, the principal administrator of Wilkes Orbital, has released a statement to the media:

\The situation is certainly serious, but it's important to keep things in perspective. At present, the disease is confined to those who were rescued from the Blue Hand Gang, so it should be perfectly possible to keep it contained. The pertinent task is to cure the infected.\

Governor Lawrence was asked how he intended to proceed.

\This is a new strain of the Cerberus Plague, one we've never seen before. But it seems that Ceremonial Heike Tea, which was used to cure the original strain of the plague, is also effective against this version of the disease. We have therefore issued an open order for Ceremonial Heike Tea with which to cure the infected. Any surplus tea will be stockpiled in anticipation of further outbreaks, although I should stress that such a scenario is extremely unlikely.\

The appeal for Ceremonial Heike Tea begins on the 17th March 3302 and will run for one week.


* Community Goal: Terraforming Vennik 1
For decades, the Revolutionary Party of Vennik has been terraforming the planet Vennik 1, slowly transforming it into a habitable world. With the ambitious project about to enter its final stage, the organisation has placed an open order for terrain-enrichment systems with which to prepare the planet's surface for agricultural development.

A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Party of Vennik released a brief statement:

\Terraforming a planet takes decades, so we're delighted to be entering the final stage. Our aim is to establish an agricultural economy on Vennik 1 so it can contribute to the production of food and medicine in the Vennik system. With the support of the galactic community, we will soon be able to reap the benefit of our efforts.\

The organisation has promised to reward those who deliver the much-needed commodities to Nixon Enterprise in the Vennik system. The campaign begins on the 17th of March 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Weekly Democracy Report
This report presents the latest data on democratic activity among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to hold elections:

STF 1774 Central Ltd

Antai Energy Group

Karadjari Creative Holdings

Chih Zhua Imperial Society

BD+04 4988 Bridge Co

Bureau of Njambalba

Elections occur when two minor factions with a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.


* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay Weekly Report summarizes the activities of the galaxy's movers and shakers in the Federation, the Empire, the Alliance, and Independent spheres of influence during the previous week.

The Federation:

The Federation experienced resource shortfalls affecting the areas of responsibility of both President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters this week. President Hudson recalled Federal fleets from Allawa and HIP 24046. If resource shortfalls are not accounted for within the coming week, President Hudson may be forced to withdraw fleets from Li Jungu, AF Leporis, and Korovii. Similarly, Shadow President Winters is struggling to meet aid commitments to HIP 38747, and is in danger of losing the system's support.

The Empire:

A dozen key systems were the focus of Imperial political machinations this week. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval deployed the Shield of Justice to Acokwang, Ao Kax, and Hrun, where the fleets now enforce Imperial justice. Senator Zemina Torval expended significant resources to finalize the purchase of key infrastructure throughout the Gacrux system. Princess Aisling Duval's campaign suffered some setbacks this week. Six influential systems, Mula Wendes, Nyalayan, HIP 95256, HIP 105391, HIP 3603, and Blod, withdrew their direct support for the People's Princess. Senator Denton Patreus' fleets moved into Anganaha and HIP 116045, where they now defend Imperial interests on behalf of the Admiral of the Fleet.

The Alliance:

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon secured a trade agreement for the Alliance in Ross 842. Alliance negotiators are currently seeking to forge trade ties with four additional systems, Aranbarahun Fedmich, HR 6328, and Ross 151. Should they succeed, the Alliance will boast a network of 95 trade centers.

Independents:

The growth of Utopia, under the leadership of Simguru Pranav Antal, was the highlight of the week in the Independent sphere of influence, with Brynhilo and Har Itariu officially becoming part of Utopia. CEO Li Yong-Rui was unable to extend a Sirius franchise to any new systems this week, but is working to finalize a contract in V780 Tauri next week. Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's attempt to overthrow Latugara was unsuccessful this week. No new Kumo incited insurrections have been spotted this week, but criminal activity is stirring in systems bordering the Pegasi sector.


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This report presents the latest data on conflict among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a civil war:

HIP 2239 Blue Mafia

HIP 2239 Silver Universal Sysy

HIP 62118 Family

HIP 62118 Universal PLC

HIP 7705 Life PLC

Integrated HIP 7705

Posse of Apiru

Apiru Domain

United HR 6797 Democrats

HR 6797 Brotherhood

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

People's Lalande 27055 Independents

G 125-30 Comms Organisation

Revolutionary G 205-47 Confederation

Hyroku Interstellar

Justice Party of BD-17 1955

Kumal Partners

Ngalakan Free

Syndicate of Bhumbla

New Wolf 1398 Confederation

45 c Bootis Travel Organisation

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Empire Troubled by Federal Campaign
Last week, Federal President Zachary Hudson announced plans to construct a new Farragut Battle Cruiser in the Federal system of Beta Hydri. The production of the ship was designed to mark the inauguration of a new arm of the Federal Navy known as the People's Navy. One Federal source said the ship would \occupy a significant role in the Federal Navy, strengthening our borders and enhancing the profile of our armed forces\.

The Empire made no response to the announcement, but an anonymous source from the upper echelons of Imperial society has now revealed that Admiral Denton Patreus has expressed concern over the Federal initiative. In a message released to a number of media feeds, the anonymous source said:

\The construction of a new ship, even a warship like the Farragut, isn't necessarily a cause for concern. But we have reason to believe that the Federation intends to significantly expand its Navy over the coming months, and naturally this has the Admiral Patreus worried. If the Federation did indeed embark on a campaign of military fortification, it's likely the Empire would respond in kind.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Asvincegin Empire Pact

Simarasir Dynamic Solutions

Volkhabe Blue United Solutions

Nepehuevit Empire Assembly

V2160 Cygni Values Party

Tjupany Blue Life Corp.

HIP 34961 Empire League

Revolutionary Gorgon Liberals

Wayan Energy Network

Left Party of Polecteri

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party

Etznabi Freedom Party

Lambda-2 Tucanae Empire League

Republic Party of Votama

Social Ross 346 Coalition

Albast Group

Sleipnera Nobles

League of CD-36 1535 Justice Party

Dierites Gold Comms Corp.

Movement for Ba Xian League

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Revolutionary Party of Wapiya

Natural Vega Liberty Party

LTT 7421 Rats

Tzeltal Blue Creative Systems

Liberals of Jumukulayon\t

People's Kehperi People's Party

Arouca Focus

Defence Party of Lave

Tarach Tor Organisation\t

Ngaliba Blue Camorra

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Diplomatic Summit in Alioth
A summit for the Alliance of Independent Systems was held at Irkutsk Station this week, attended by ambassadors and diplomatic envoys from an array of political backgrounds. Eleven fleets, from both Alliance and Independent governments, were represented.

The main topic under discussion was establishing a framework for a quick-response force to protect parties from the growing threat of Imperial and Federal expansion. Other Topics included factional sovereignty, self governance, the benefits of free trade, and the role of communication in maintaining civility across diverse cultures.

* Freelance Report: CIMA Prepares for Final Sprint
Maxim 'VicTic' Kammerer, chief engineer of the Carmack Intergalactic Mining Association, has released a statement concerning the ongoing CIMA prospectors' competition:

\We are very pleased that, with your help, we have been able to double the amount of known pristine metallic ring locations, most of which are very close to the bubble. Now we need to prepare for the final sprint.\

The competition will end on the 3rd of April 3302. Any data on pristine metallic rings should be reported before this date.

* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report
This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

Union of V740 Cassiopeiae Future

Brokutsu Confederation\t

HIP 107806 and Co

Tambe Independent Protectorate

Grebato Corp.

Conservatives of Tiliala

Uniting Worom Pef

LP 806-8 Central Interstellar

Ross 546 PLC

Nationals of Algreit

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest:

Khong Wang Independents

Karadjari Creative Holdings

Cromovit Bureau

Unionists of LHS 1393

HIP 108419 Gold State Limited

Tuareg State Industry

Mudrus Exchange

People's Nocorioson for Equality

Flesk Transport Organisation

Dassareti Future

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Freelance Report: Cerberus Plague Past and Present
Carl Simmons, chief medical officer at Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system, spoke at a health summit over the weekend. His keynote address was on the Cerberus plague.

\The original Cerberus plague spread to over 30 systems inside a month, putting billions of lives at risk,\ said Simmons. \It is unlikely we would have been able to eradicate the disease had the cure been discovered any later, as ceremonial Heike tea would not have been available in sufficient quantities. Trillions could have perished.\

\We cannot afford to underestimate this new strain of Cerberus plague, and I urge the medical community to take the outbreak seriously. If Heike tea is not delivered in sufficient quantities, or if this strain proves resistant to the tea's effects, the consequences could be catastrophic.\

* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey to be Revived
Medical personnel at Leoniceno Orbital have announced they will soon bring former Federal president Jasmina Halsey out of her induced coma. When the former president arrived at the starport she was still in her damaged escape pod. Since then, medical personnel at the starport have worked tirelessly to heal the injuries she sustained in the destruction of Starship One. Having completed this process, Halsey's doctors now believe it is safe to start waking their patient.

\The process of waking President Halsey from her coma must be done gradually,\ said Dr Lucy Ingles, who has been overseeing Halsey's treatment. \She is still in a delicate condition.\

If the process is successful, the former president should be fully conscious within a few days.


* Powerplay: Incoming Update
At 7.00 am tomorrow morning (GMT), the monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled. Pilots who operate for one of the powers should deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time to ensure their activities are registered.


* Community Goal: Neutralising the Unknown Artefact Threat
Professor Ishmael Palin has shocked medical personnel at Wilkes Orbital by returning to work only hours after he received the antidote to the Cerberus Plague. According to Palin's doctor, the professor was eager to talk to Lea Tantaga, the molecular chemist who recently developed a material capable of countering the Unknown Artefacts' self-repair mechanism. The scientists' conversation resulted in the following statement from Professor Palin:

\The significance of Professor Tantaga's breakthrough is clear: the means to safely contain the Unknown Artefacts is now within our grasp. What we need now are quantities of meta-alloys so we can produce more of the UA-resistant material.\

A conglomerate based in the Maia system has pledged to support the appeal by mass-producing the UA-resistant material, assuming sufficient quantities of meta-alloys are received. This will then be used to create special ship modules that can safely transport the Unknown Artefacts.

The Pioneer's Cooperative has placed an open order for meta-alloys, and has promised to generously reward pilots who contribute to the initiative. The campaign begins on the 24th March 3302 and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: Wilkes Orbital Appeal Comes to an End
Authorities at Wilkes Orbital have announced that the recent appeal for Ceremonial Heike Tea has been a significant success. Personnel at the starport launched the appeal when they discovered that the individuals recently rescued from the Blue Hand Gang were infected with a strain of the Cerberus Plague.

The galactic community was unequivocal in its support of the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Wilkes Orbital. Governor Lawrence, the station's principal administrator, released a statement to the media:

\Thanks to the swift response of the galactic community, we are now in a position to treat those infected by the Cerberus Plague. The surplus Ceremonial Heike Tea will be stockpiled to ensure that any further outbreaks can be immediately neutralised.\

Since news of the epidemic first broke, questions have been raised about how Professor Palin and his colleagues could have been infected by the pathogen. Drusus Kane, head of an Imperial counter-insurgency unit in the Achenar system, offered his opinion:

\The chances of these individuals being contaminated by accident are extremely small. I believe the abductors deliberately infected Professor Palin and his colleagues, possibly in order to disseminate the disease among the wider galactic population. Fortunately, on this occasion their plans were not successful.\


* Galactic News: Terraforming Campaign Extended
The Revolutionary Party of Vennik has made an announcement regarding the terraforming of Vennik 1. A spokesperson confirmed that the organisation plans to extend the campaign for a second week.

\Due to overly ambitious estimates, it seems the supply of land-enrichment systems in nearby systems is exceeded by our demand. We have therefore decided to keep the contract open for an additional week, at considerable expense, to ensure we receive enough material to complete our terraforming project.\

The campaign will now run until the 31st of March 3302.


* Community Goal: Jeffress's New Treasure Hunt
Following a long hiatus, reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has announced a new treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner.

In a statement, Jeffress confirmed that the event will follow the same format as his previous treasure hunts. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find it and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will set participants on the path to finding the mystery object:

\The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in her steps.\

With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.

* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey Brought Out of Coma
Federal President Zachary Hudson has released a statement confirming that former president Jasmina Halsey has been brought out of her induced coma.

\The injuries Jasmina Halsey suffered in the destruction of Starship One were severe, but her escape pod preserved her vital functions. Having repaired her injuries, medical personnel at Leoniceno Orbital revived President Halsey from her coma this morning. I have been told that she is now sleeping peacefully, and is expected to wake in the next few days.\

Reporters were told that Halsey would need at least a week before she is likely to be able to talk to those outside her immediate family.

* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Supporting Meta-Alloy Drive
Verity Gavroche, official correspondent for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has spoken to Dr Arcanonn about the meta-alloy drive from the Pioneer's Cooperative:

\On the 24th of March, the Pioneer's Cooperative \u2013 an organisation of which the Canonn is a proud member \u2013 placed an open order for meta-alloys to be delivered to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system. The goal is to gather enough of the material to produce ship modules that are resistant to the Unknown Artefacts' self-repair mechanism, thus preventing system degradation in ships transporting UAs.\

\Obviously, our considerable interest in the UAs means that the possibility of transporting them without incurring ship damage is extremely exciting. In addition to the financial incentives on offer, I'm certain that being able to freely transport UAs will be a crucial part of future scientific research. So please bring your meta-alloys to Obsidian Orbital today!\

* Galactic News: Treasure Hunt Comes to an End
The treasure hunt organised by billionaire philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has come to an end, with a pilot by the name of Commander Oriza claiming victory. Thousands of people took part in the competition, but ultimately there could only be one victor.

As with Jeffress's previous treasure hunts, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery object at the centre of the search \u2013 a relic from Earth's past. The clues took pilots to Persephone in the Avalon system, then to Arrhenius Terminal in Bard and finally to the Algol system.

When the winner was announced, Alfred Jeffress released the following statement:

\I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the winner. One of my representatives will be in touch soon to give you the details of your prizes. As for the other competitors, I would like to offer my commiserations. But do not despair! There will be another Jeffress treasure hunt, and next time the winner could be you.\


* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey Not yet at Full Health
For the past three days, Jasmina Halsey has been recuperating at Leoniceno Orbital, where she was taken after she was rescued from the wreckage of Starship One. Since then, all interview requests have been firmly rebuffed by the starport's medical personnel, who insist the former president is not yet well enough to talk to the media. But while the galaxy waits for an official interview, the Federal Times has managed to wrest a few words from her sister, Azalea Halsey, who recently visited her sibling:

\Jasmina appears to be in good health, but she did seem rather distant. She said some things I didn't understand \u2013 something about stars and...creation, I think \u2013 but given what she's been through I thought she was remarkably lucid, most of the time. I'm sure she'll be back to her old self soon.\

It is hoped that the former Federal president will talk to the media in the next few days.


* Freelance Report: Distant Worlds Expedition Reaches Beagle Point
Nearly three months ago, approximately 1,000 pilots set a course for Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0, informally designated 'Beagle Point,' on the far side of the Milky Way.

This week, Distant Worlds Expedition coordinators announced that some members of the fleet have reached their destination. A charismatic member of the expedition \u2013 a Commander by the name of Salom\u00e9 \u2013 was among the first to arrive at Beagle Point.

A total of 23 pre-arranged waypoints have helped to organise the fleet and facilitate social interaction, including SRV races. Unfortunately, this coordination has not completely mitigated losses: of the 1,000 commanders who set out for Beagle Point, it is estimated that only 25% have survived the 81,500 light-year journey, and it's likely that the return journey will result in further losses.

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest:

Blue Universal Company

Purungurawn Purple Society

Jet Central Company

Confederacy of WISE J000517

Neali Free

Revolutionary Zelada Democrats

Lusonda Crimson Energy Limited

Revolutionary Nysa Future

LFT 163 Group

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Freelance Report: Buckyball Racing Club Announces Total Recall Event
The Buckyball Racing club has announced that it is hosting a ship and buggy race called 'Total Recall'. The event is being funded by a major manufacturer of SRV tyres in exchange for data on high-speed vehicle handling on a variety of planet surfaces.

Following observations that their tyres do not appear to leave tracks, a spokesperson for the company said: \We've been investigating this anomaly for some time. With the data provided by the BRC, we plan to start developing the next generation of high-performance 'TrakMark' tyres very soon\.

The event will run out of Schneider Relay in the Epsilon Indi system from the 2nd to the 10th of April 3302.

* Galactic News: Meta-Alloys Appeal Comes to an End
The Pioneers Cooperative has announced that the recent appeal for meta-alloys has received the full support of the galactic community. Having taken delivery of thousands of tonnes of meta-alloys, the organisation will now begin producing ship modules that can safely transport the Unknown Artefacts. A spokesperson for the Pioneers Cooperative released a brief statement:

\Given the relative scarcity of meta-alloys, we were concerned we might not receive enough, but the galactic community has proven itself equal to the task. Work on the new modules is scheduled to start at once.\

Meanwhile, Professor Tantaga was asked about the starports experiencing UA-related malfunctions.

\In theory, the UA-resistant material could be used to return the affected starports to normality, but I don't think launching a second campaign for meta-alloys is the right approach. In my opinion, the affected starports should be given the formula for the UA-resistant material, so any meta-alloys they have can be used to protect their outposts.\


* Galactic News: Terraforming Campaign Comes to an End
The Revolutionary Party of Vennik announced that it has received sufficient quantities of terrain-enrichment systems to bring its terraforming project to a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's appeal by delivering the much-needed commodities to Nixon Enterprise. The success of the campaign will allow the organisation to embark on the final phase of its plan to terraform Vennik 1, by preparing the planet's surface for agricultural development.

Following the success of the campaign, a spokesperson for the Revolutionary Party of Vennik released a brief statement:

\For decades, the people of Vennik have harboured a dream \u2013 a dream of a life-sustaining, fertile Vennik 1. Today, that dream becomes a reality. We are hugely grateful to those who helped us achieve our dream by supporting our recent appeal. Thanks to you, the arid expanses of Vennik 1 will soon be verdant panoramas, resplendent with life.\


* Community Goal: The Onionhead Clash
The ongoing Federal campaign against Onionhead has taken a new turn with the appointment of an 'Onionhead tzar', who will assume overall responsibility for eliminating the drug from Federal space. Edward Bores, a seasoned government official, has assumed the role, promising to employ \targeted measures\ in the fight against the illegal narcotic.

At a press event, Bores marked his appointment with the announcement of an innovative new campaign:

\We are launching an initiative called 'Hand in the Head' designed to encourage Federal citizens to surrender any Onionhead in their possession. Individuals who deliver Onionhead to our headquarters at Grandin Gateway in the Altair system will be generously rewarded. At the end of the campaign, any Onionhead we have received will be destroyed.\

Meanwhile, an organisation known as the Altair Purple Mob has launched a campaign to prove that the drug is harmless, with the ultimate aim of having it reclassified as a non-toxic plant. Like the Federation, the organisation has issued an appeal for quantities of the drug, but unlike the Federation, the Altair Purple Mob intends to study the plant rather than destroy it. A spokesperson for the organisation said:

\Legalising Onionhead would decriminalise its users, provide the Federal government with a new revenue stream, and destabilise the criminal network through which the drug is currently bought and sold. It's a no-brainer.\

The competing campaigns are scheduled to begin on the 31st of March 3302, and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: Weekly Democracy Report

* Galactic News: Access to Naraka Temporarily Restricted
For some, Naraka is a system located in the Hydrae Sector, but for others, it's a system situated between Pi-Fang and Eranin. That's because there are two systems that bear the name 'Naraka'.

This quirk of circumstance has long been a source of confusion for independent pilots, but Universal Cartographics has deigned to address the issue by renaming the former of the two systems.

A Federal spokesperson released a brief statement:

\Until Universal Cartographics has dealt with this issue, all travel to the Naraka system has been restricted. Access to the Naraka system located between Pi-Fang and Eranin remains unhindered.\

Not everyone is happy about the impending change, however, with one resident of the soon-to-be renamed system remarking:

\This is all well and good, but what will happen to my mail? It's like Universal Cartographics didn't even consider the postal service.\


* Galactic News: Concern over New Ship Modules
Recent reports indicate that some members of the galactic community are concerned about the development of Unknown Artefact-resistant ship modules. Critics of the new technology, developed by Professor Lea Tantaga, have claimed it will facilitate further black-market trade of Unknown Artefacts, thus exacerbating the so-called technological plague.

In an attempt to counter the rising concern, a member of the technical team at Obsidian Orbital released the following statement:

\I know some people are concerned that these new modules might aggravate the technological plague, but there's every reason to believe we can use the Unknown Artefact-resistant material developed by Professor Tantaga to protect our starports from UA-related malfunctions. All that's needed is for pilots to deliver meta-alloys to the affected starports. We'll do the rest.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

Ngane Patron's Principles

Caleta Liberals

Gugurun Jet Power Industries

Svaratia Syndicate

Pilati Rats

Plendovii Solutions

Ross 163 Liberals

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Nobles of Kirrae\t

Irulachan Jet Public Inc

Jaroere Exchange

HR 8380 Silver Central Solutions

Crimson State Industry

Alanaribri Transport Holdings

Nationals of HIP 6108

HIP 101857 Silver Life Int

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.


* Freelance Report: Firefly Fandango Theory Disproven
Weeks after Dr Arcanonn shared Commander Engalo's report of a 'firefly fandango' between the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys, he has issued this update:

\After Engalo's research was published, our science teams set to work, trying to identify whether an interaction was indeed taking place. Soon after, many Commanders \u2013 including Locastan, Criosx and Engalo himself \u2013 came to the conclusion that what they were witnessing was most likely a product of the distortion field surrounding the Unknown Artefacts.\

\The field seems to diffract light in the Artefacts' vicinity, causing objects around them to appear in duplicate. After close observation, it was concluded that what appeared to be pairs of dancing fireflies were actually duplicates of the same firefly.\

\I commend the teams for their hard work, and am pleased to be able to cross this phenomenon off our list of investigations.\

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Galactic News: Halsey Talks to the Media
Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey spoke to select reporters at Leoniceno Orbital today, answering the questions many have wanted to ask since she was recovered from the wreckage of Starship One. When asked about Starship One's destruction, Halsey replied:

\I remember very little, really. A thunderous noise, then silence. Being thrown across the bridge in my chair, and then being unable to breathe. I remember one of my bodyguards getting me to the pod as things floated about silently, like a dream. The last thing I remember is a terrible pain in my ears and a very loud noise as the pod filled with what looked like steam.\

The former president's voice was distant, and she seemed to drift off between sentences. She certainly did not sound like the forceful leader from last year.

A reporter from the Alliance Tribune asked President Halsey what it was like to drift through space for so long:

\It was wonderful. Amazing. I saw the universe, and our galaxy within it, as I'd never seen it before, and I felt the presence of the real caretakers of our galaxy. The paradox of their existence \u2013 tiny yet gargantuan, fleeting yet eternal. They spoke to me as I drifted in the void. It was amazing. I must share their message.\

This unorthodox statement prompted a flurry of further questions, but Halsey's escorts promptly led her from the room.

* Community Goal: Improving Mining Facilities at Kooi Gateway
The Canary Mining Corporation has announced plans to improve mining in the HIP 93377 system by asking independent pilots to deliver mineral extractors to Kooi Gateway, for the development of improved material-processing facilities at the station.

 A spokesperson for the corporation made the following statement:

\The new equipment will allow us to efficiently collect, process and store larger quantities of minerals and metals than ever before, as well as offer a wider range of equipment to independent miners working in the system.\

The organisation has promised to reward those who deliver the much-needed equipment to Kooi Gateway in the HIP 93377 system.

The campaign begins on the 7th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Eliminating Agitators in Morrina
Recent reports from Morrina indicate that the system is in the grip of widespread civil unrest. The system's inhabitants have taken to the streets to express their displeasure with local authorities, which have been criticised for failing to tackle rampant criminal activity.

In response to this development, the Morrina Pro-Alliance Party has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Barjavel Vision.

The campaign begins on the 7th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Research Initiative Trumps Federal Campaign
The Federal campaign against Onionhead suffered a setback this week when its 'Hand in the Head' initiative received only modest support from the galactic community. Despite the best efforts of Federal campaigners, a competing scheme to support further research into the drug proved more popular with the public. But although the Federal campaign enjoyed only limited success, 'Onionhead tzar' Edward Bores remained bullish.

\It's true that we hoped to receive more support,\ said Bores, \but this is still a significant success. Thousands of tonnes of Onionhead have now been removed from circulation, weakening the criminal networks that thrive on the sale and distribution of this dangerous drug.\

Meanwhile, the Altair Purple Mob, which organised the competing campaign, expressed its satisfaction at the outcome:

\Outlawing substances like Onionhead serves only to criminalise otherwise law-abiding citizens and put money in the pockets of criminals. Thanks to the galactic community, we now have the means to conduct further research into Onionhead and prove beyond doubt that not only is it harmless, it possesses considerable health benefits.\

* Galactic News: Congratulations to Distant Worlds Explorers
From a vantage point more than 65,000 light years from Sol, a transmission has been received regarding the Distant Worlds Expedition. Sent by a Commander Salom\u00e9, the message congratulates Dr Kaii and Commander Erimus on their colossal achievement, and pays homage to the hundreds of other explorers who took part.

\The voyage has yielded a wealth of exploration data, and may well contain remarkable new discoveries about the galaxy in which we live. It has been a pleasure and privilege to be involved, and I wish all the explorers a safe voyage home.\

Early analysis of the recovered data indicates that a number of new routes have been scouted, including pathways to Beagle Point, the Core, the Formidine Rift, the Norma Expanse and many other parts of the galaxy. These routes combine in a complex cobweb, paths through the void. Sceptics were quick to put these discoveries in context, however:

\Scouting a route is all very well, and we applaud the achievements of these adventurers,\ said Karl Devene, head of Astrocartography at Mars High. \But these explorers should not be under the impression that these areas can be considered even partially charted. There is much that remains to be done.\


* Freelance Report: Commander Claims Sovereignty over Sagittarius A*
Unusual news has emerged from the galactic centre, where an independent pilot has declared herself 'Queen of Sagittarius A*'.

Commander Lysianassa, the self-proclaimed monarch, made the 26,000 light year journey in a fully armed Federal Corvette with heavy bulkheads and prismatic shields. Most explorers travelling to the centre of the galaxy are lightly armed, if at all.

The legality and morality of Commander Lysianassa's right-by-conquest approach has been hotly debated by independent pilots. Lysianassa claims to have brought law and order to an otherwise anarchic system, thus protecting defenceless explorers, but not all agree. Some recognise the authority of 'Her Royal Majesty Queen Lysianassa', but others claim she is nothing more than a criminal with delusions of grandeur.

There are currently no provisions in interstellar law about the neutrality of Sagittarius A*, but it is widely considered a heritage site for humanity.

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay Weekly Report summarizes the activities of the galaxy's movers and shakers in the Federation, the Empire, the Alliance, and Independent spheres of influence during the previous week.

The Federation:

Federal President Zachary Hudson passed a busy week, guiding the establishment of naval bases in Opet, Annwn, Adan, Ch'iang Fei, Okinura, Delta Pavonis and Gitse. These attempts to expand the Federal powerbase ultimately failed due to serious supply shortages, which also necessitated the withdrawal of Federal fleets from Bandjigali and Lalande 37120. If Federal supply chains cannot meet demands, Phra Mool may also lose the direct protection of the Federal Navy.

In contrast, Shadow President Winters passed a quiet week on the home front. As a result, a budget surplus will allow her to extend aid to more systems than previously projected during the coming week.

The Empire:

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's staff exposed endemic corruption in Ande, Sawait and Tujil last week. The Emperor has authorized Shield of Justice Patrols to bring criminal elements operating in these systems to justice.

Princess Aisling Duval secured new supporters in HIP 105391. A fresh batch of sealed contracts are en route to Blod and HIP 95256. Should these systems accept the contracts, the People's Princess will directly influence 60 key systems.

Many private security vessels within Senator Zemina Torval's domain remained moored this week, with political unrest the lowest it's been in about 15 weeks. The Senator's brokers are currently preparing deeds for the purchase of a key assets in Grudi and HR 6948.

Senator Denton Patreus' sale of marked arms in Medzistha and Mula Wendes were initially well received, but the movement of the Senator's fleets in both systems has stimulated anti-Imperial sentiments in both systems. System resistance forces have assembled to violently oppose the presence of Patreus' fleets.

The Alliance:

The vast trade network of the Alliance of Independent Systems fell into a deep recession this week. Blockades are currently in place in 21 systems with Alliance trade agreements. These blockades  were reportedly put into place by Federation corporations looking to increase their dominance in the galactic market. It is unclear at this time how long this blockades may last, or how the galactic markets will economy will be affected.

Independents:

The movements of Archon Delaine and the Kumo were the highlight of independent power activities this week. The conquest of Devata Baru increased the total number of strongholds occupied by the Terror of the Pegasi Sector to 42. The Pirate Lord has incited insurrections in Latugara and Mikunn, and may soon subject these systems to his rule.

Simguru Pranav Antal's Utopian society and CEO Li Yong Rui's SiriusGov were occupied primarily with administrative tasks. Utopia is at last prepared to send ambassadors abroad to entice systems to join the commune. If all goes well during the coming week, Sirius will finalize a contract with the Chemaku system.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Malibata Purple Bridge Comms

Confederacy of Mandubii

Nagarans League

Guardians of Harmony

LHS 304 Crimson Dynamic Co

HIP 58213 Co-operative

Keliuona Patron's Principles

Bodhinga Empire Assembly

Silver Life Co

Uniting Qamadi

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Independents of Mildeptu

Workers of TZ Arietis Democrats

LHS 3516 Fortune Company

Ndjabog Purple Comms Solutions

NLTT 7856 Imperial Society

LTT 2963 Crimson Vision PLC

Nocori Progressive Party

Green Party of Ross 302

Alliance Office of Statistics

Opala Power Commodities

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Kamadhenu Partners

Drug Empire of HIP 78866

TaexaliTemu Empire Group

Worker's Party of Kemurukamar

Nationals of Seurbi

Freedom Party of Kala

Thosiao Republic Party

HIP 60953 Jet Clan

Wolf 906 Gold Ring

Monarchy of GCRV 54903

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Humanity's Dream
On this date 1,341 years ago, humanity achieved a dream it had harboured for generations. For the first time, advanced rocket technology propelled a human being beyond the boundaries of Earth and into space.

To commemorate Yuri Gagarin's historic flight, pilots gather every year at the M. Gorbachev starport in the Sol system from 18.00 UST onwards to swap first-flight stories and buy rounds at Tereshkova's Hangout. A member of station personnel said:

\For some, it's quite a pilgrimage. We've had pilots from Sothis, Quince, Fehu and Canopus in previous years. People want to see the cradle of humanity and remember the moment when the dream of touching the stars was realised. It's a time for looking back and looking forward. We spent many millennia dreaming that dream, and it's been just over a thousand years since we achieved it.\

* Galactic News: Morrina Peacekeeping Campaign Comes to an End
The Morrina Pro-Alliance Party has announced that its campaign to clear the Morrina system of agitators was a success. Hundreds of combat pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. A spokesperson for the Morrina Pro-Alliance Party released a brief statement:

\We are hugely grateful to all those who contributed to this campaign. Your efforts have brought a measure of stability to Morrina, allowing us to move towards a better, more peaceful future.\

Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at Barjavel Vision.


* Galactic News: Canary Mining Campaign Comes to an End
The Canary Mining Corporation has announced that it has received sufficient quantities of <item> to carry out its improvement programme at Kooi Gateway. Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's appeal by delivering the much-needed equipment to the station in the HIP 93377 system.

Following the success of the campaign, a spokesperson for the Canary Mining Corporation released a brief statement:

\The Canary Mining Corporation has been working tirelessly for years to develop the mining and extraction facilities in HIP 93377. Today, that hard work has paid off as our plans become reality. We are hugely grateful to those who helped us achieve our goal by supporting this appeal. Thanks to you, mining facilities in HIP 93377 will be greatly improved and Kooi Gateway will become the system's extraction powerhouse.\


* Community Goal: Bringing Back the Bourbon
Rumours from the Epsilon Indi system suggest that the United Epsilon Indi Flag is recruiting independent Commanders for a campaign called 'Bribes 4 Bourbon'. In a series of illicit meetings with system officials, the organisation reportedly secured an agreement to revise the status of Indi Bourbon and make it a legal beverage.

Yulia 'The Needle' Kuriakova, a spokeswoman for the organisation, said:

\For almost a year, authorities in Epsilon Indi have prohibited the production of Indi Bourbon, which is classified as an illegal substance. Our plan is to bring vast quantities of illegal liquor Mansfield Orbiter to pay off the officials.\

The United Epsilon Indi Flag has requested that Burnham Bile Distillate, Eranin Pearl Whisky, Leestian Evil Juice and Wuthielo Ku Froth be smuggled into Mansfield Orbiter. A temporary black market has been established to accept these commodities.

The Federation, meanwhile, has asserted that the campaign represents an act of economic malfeasance, and has accused the United Epsilon Indi Flag of inciting civil disobedience. But Epsilon Indi is no stranger to dissent: in November last year an explosive-smuggling operation organised by a group called Revolution Incorporated was uncovered.

The United Epsilon Indi Flag has promised to reward pilots who deliver rare liquors to Mansfield Orbiter in the Epsilon Indi system. The campaign begins on the 14th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Alliance to Establish New Outpost
Harlyn Tavistok, a senior member of the Alliance Assembly, has announced plans to establish a new outpost on the fringes of inhabited space. According to Tavistok, the new station will provide the Alliance with \a vitally important new resource, significantly bolstering our reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering capabilities.\ An Alliance spokesperson provided further details:

\Monitoring activity within human-inhabited space is of central importance to our continued security, but this particular sector currently contains a limited number of operational outposts. Our new station will address this issue.\

\To support this campaign, we have placed open orders via our partners at <faction> for Robotics, Semi Conductors and Auto Fabricators. Pilots who deliver these essential commodities to our base of operations at Noli Dock will be generously compensated.\

The campaign begins on the 14th April 3302 and will run for one week.


* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay weekly report summarises the activities of the galaxy's movers and shakers in the Federation, the Empire, the Alliance and Independent spheres of influence during the previous week.

The Federation:

The Federal Navy's garrison supply shortage was ended this week, preventing the need to abandon another base in Phra Mool. Federal President Zachary Hudson is currently receiving intelligence reports from a number of systems, and will decide where to focus the efforts of the Federal Navy by the end of the week.

Shadow President Winters claimed the full support of residents in the Puntin system this week, bringing the number of systems under her direct control to 70. Federal Aid transports are currently attempting to showcase the merits of Federal health and welfare programmes in HIP 50489 and Kappa.

The Empire:

Ao Kax descended into turmoil this week, jeopardizing Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's hold on the system. If she is able to allocate sufficient supplies to garrison the Shield of Justice and restore order, HR 4720 may join her cause.

Princess Aisling Duval claimed support from citizens in Blod and HIP 95256, swelling Aisling's support base to 60 systems. The People's Princess is currently dispatching sealed contracts to the Conii system.

Senator Zemina Torval finalized the purchase of assets in HR 6948, but deals to acquire matching assets in Grudi fell through. Torval currently has her sights set on Bandjigali, Candecama and VVO 19.

Senator Denton Patreus, the Admiral of the Imperial Fleet, was rebuffed in his efforts to stage his fleets in Medzistha and Mula Wendes. Patreus's fleets are currently staged in LFT 142, Menero Kimi and V374 Pegasi.

The Alliance:

Alliance bureaucrats busily collected an unprecedented quantity of briefings and status reports from preferred trading systems. The blockades put in place by Federation-aligned corporations forced 12 systems to rescind their trade agreements with the Alliance. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is reportedly attempting to re-establish relations with these beleaguered systems. A total of 86 systems remain in the Alliance trade network.

Independents:

No systems changed hands among the independent powers this week, but each power is preparing to make bold moves in the coming week.

SiriusGov CEO Li Yong-Rui is attempting to purchase huge swathes of private and government assets in Chang O.

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine was unable to secure new strongholds in Mikunn and Latugara, and no new insurrections have been spotted.

Simguru Pranav Antal is attempting to expand the reach of Utopia to Allowa, Anouphis, Antanyamai, FS 34, LP 708-253, Maia and Renpetani. Should all of these systems become a part of Utopia, their enclaves will be present in 55 systems.

* Galactic News: Did the Empire Destroy Starship One?
Tensions between the Federation and the Empire look likely to increase following an announcement from Federal politician Jacob Harris. In a statement released to The Federal Times, Harris claimed that the destruction of Starship One was not the result of mechanical failure, as was widely reported, but was in fact the result of deliberate sabotage by Imperial agents.

\I cannot identify my sources for fear of compromising their safety,\ said Harris, \but I can assure you that their information is correct. Starship One was destroyed by the Empire in an attempt to destabilise the Federal power base. It was made to look like an accident \u2013 the official Federal investigation even concluded it was an accident \u2013 but it most certainly was not.\

Imperial officials were quick to condemn Harris's claims, citing both his lack of evidence and his reluctance to reveal his sources. Among those voicing scepticism was Senator Zemina Torval.

\This is nothing more than uncorroborated gossip,\ said the senator, \and it is highly irresponsible of Jacob Harris to disseminate such rumours. The Empire would never perpetrate such an act, and given Harris's well-known predilection for scaremongering, I think only a fool would believe him.\

The Federation appeared less eager to dismiss Harris's claims, although a statement from Shadow President Felicia Winters indicated that she was not necessarily ready to accept the story, either.

\These rumours are certainly troubling, but it would be highly imprudent for us to believe them without evidence. Harris has made an extraordinary claim, so the burden of proving that claim rests with him.\


* Galactic News: Ishmael Palin to Retire from Active Research
Professor Ishmael Palin has announced his intention to retire from the research institute he founded last year. In a statement, the professor explained the reasoning behind the decision:

\It has been a tremendous pleasure to be part of the discourse surrounding the Unknown Artefacts, and to share ideas and opinions with so many passionate individuals. But there are dark forces at work in the galactic community \u2013 forces that exist in opposition to the ideals I hold most dear \u2013 and I lack the strength to continue fighting them.\

\I have therefore decided to relinquish my directorship of The Palin Institute to Professor Cora Shaw, who has for many years been my closest ally. I have every faith in Professor Shaw's ability to lead The Palin Institute to even greater heights, and to uphold the ideals for which it stands.\

\I fully intend to continue researching the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys, albeit in a more inconspicuous fashion, at my personal research centre on Maia A 3 a. Those who wish to visit me there are very welcome to do so. There is nothing I enjoy more than spending time with those who share my interests!\


* Galactic News: Services Suspended at Fozard Dock
Authorities at Fozard Dock in the HIP 19934 system have announced the immediate suspension of all services due to Unknown Artefact-related interference. Starport personnel have confirmed that only docking and shipyard access remain available. This brings the total number of starports closed as a result of the technological plague to 12. The affected stations are:

Fozard Dock, HIP 19934

Irens Dock, Manite

Ackerman Market, Eravate

von Bellingshausen Port, Almar

Haack Gateway, Halbangaay

Gabriel Enterprise, Harma

Gurragchaa Gateway, Warkushanui

Gaiman Dock, 49 Arietis

Weyn Dock, 64 Arietis

Korolyov Hub, Arawere

Lobachevsky Outpost, Pic Tok

Carter Port, Rhea

Meanwhile, the following starports are still experiencing technical issues:

Alexander Freeport, HIP 18843

Bloch Vision, Loperada

Love Ring, Evejitaka

Robigo Mines, Robigo

Saunders's Dive, Wolf 1301

Skvortsov Orbital, 63 G. Capricorni

Hinz Hub, Ngobe


* Freelance Report: First Expedition to Rho Cassiopeiae Confirmed
Commander turkwinif, flying an Anaconda specially outfitted for long-distance hyperspace jumps, has become the first pilot to reach Rho Cassiopeiae. The class-F hypergiant star is notable for being visible to the naked eye from Earth, and for being positioned in a particularly hard-to-reach area of what explorers call the Formidine Rift.

Many pilots have previously tried to reach Rho Cassiopeiae, and their lack of success led many to consider the star beyond the reach of current technology. Commander turkwinif reported that reaching the system required careful route planning and the use of numerous FSD fuel injections.

Commander Finn McMillan


* Freelance Report: Fuel Rats Reach Milestone
A Fuel Rats public relations official has announced that the collective has now succeeded in rescuing more than 10,000 stranded pilots.

Comprising a widespread network of voluntary search and rescue agents, the Fuel Rats has maintained a success rate of over 95% since its foundation in June 3301. On average, the group saves 36 pilots a day.

\The Fuel Rats is the only collective entirely dedicated to such rescues,\ said the representative. \For a cooperative based on volunteers, donations and goodwill to reach such a milestone in less than a year is impressive.\

\When I look back at our anarchic beginnings, and see this ragtag bunch of misfit explorers expand into this remarkable cooperative, I am humbled.\

The representative also explained that the group is planning a memorial service for all those the Fuel Rats failed to save. The service is currently planned for the 5th of May 3302 and is scheduled to run for one week.

Commander Kerenn


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Gullici Jet Pirates

Chao Wu Commodities

Unionists of CD-66 2585\t0

Nocoma Solutions

Natural HIP 18327 Nationalists

HIP 117706 Purple Netcoms Inc

Angelic Church of Messi

Kelie Silver Major Industries

League of Hrunapori Autocracy

Independent Kiliwatsuki Free

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

LP 104-2 Silver State Comms

Paucates Gold Brothers

Kaiablingah Blue Raiders

Grovichun Purple Boys

United Epsilon Indi Flag

LTT 8517 Jet Gang

Irukama Labour

Natural Vega Liberty Party

Gridge Life Exchange

Maiki Silver Mafia

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Canonn to Make Deep-Space Rendezvous
An escape pod containing Canonn scientist Shannon Day has been miraculously recovered by an explorer named Commander Josh Hawkins, according to transmissions received from his ship.

In his transmissions, Commander Hawkins revealed that he was able to extract Shannon Day's pilot log from her escape pod. From this he discovered that her ship had been sabotaged by Socha Korbemile, the former Canonn member who betrayed Dr Arcanonn.

Now, the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has announced that two scientists \u2013 Commanders Bowen the Kotoc and Julian McCoy \u2013 have been dispatched to find Commander Hawkins and bring Day's escape pod home to Thompson Dock in the Varati system.

When news of Day's rescue reached Dr Arcanonn, he requested that her escape pod be recovered as quickly as possible, but it is not yet known why she is so important to the scientist.

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report
This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

Social Lalande 2682 Alliance

Mebech Tzu Protectorate

Snoqui Xian Future

Epsilon Indi Purple Central

Orgetu Jet Mafia

Liberals of Chongguls

Fomovithi Corp.

Alliance of Neganhot

Official Elska Movement

Jet Power Network

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest:

Noblemen of Nez Perce

HIP 80242 Blue Universal Serv

Alliance of Reddot

Revolutionary UGP 145 Free

Friends of Oho Bajo

Allied CE Bootis Defence Force

George Pantazis Democrats

Partnership of DW Camelopardalis

Namago Commodities

Friends of Arngi

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Galactic News: Indi Bourbon Campaign Comes to an End
The United Epsilon Indi Flag has announced that its campaign to decriminalise Indi Bourbon received the full support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the group's appeal for help, flooding Mansfield Orbiter with illegal rare liquors in protest against the Federal decision to restrict the sale of the popular bourbon.

Yulia 'The Needle' Kuriakova, a spokesperson for the organisation, released a brief statement:

\It is with great pleasure that we announce the reclassification of Indi Bourbon, thanks in no small part to the hundreds of Pilots Federation members who answered our call. Corporations need to learn that they cannot undermine long-held traditions just to line their own corrupt pockets. It is no small irony that those same officials accepted bribes to legitimise Indi Bourbon.\


* Galactic News: Alliance Initiative Successful
An Alliance spokesperson has announced that the campaign to establish a new outpost received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. The spokesperson confirmed that significant quantities of robotics, semi conductors and auto fabricators were delivered to Noti Dock, allowing construction of the new station to begin.

Harlyn Tavistok, a member of the Alliance Assembly who has been overseeing the campaign, released a brief statement to the media:

\We are extremely grateful for the public's support, which has been integral to the success of this campaign. Construction of the new outpost is scheduled to begin at once. Soon we will have a valuable new resource in the sector.\

But the success of the campaign has been overshadowed by criticism from Imperial and Federal commentators, who questioned the purpose of the new outpost. Some have asked whether the Alliance's avowed intention to 'maintain awareness' is in fact an allusion to monitoring Imperial and Federal activity. Others have speculated that the outpost campaign might be the first phase of an expansion initiative.

Harlyn Tavistok declined to address the rumours.


* Community Goal: Expanding the Imperial Fleet
Admiral Denton Patreus has announced plans to expand the Imperial Navy with a new Majestic-Class Interdictor. The formidable vessel will boast a range of imposing weaponry, including an array of modular interceptor guns.

Lieutenant Severin, who is overseeing the ship's construction, issued a statement to the media:

\I know there are some who would question the need for this vessel. To those individuals, I say this: just how safe do you feel? We live in an age in which even Emperors can be murdered. An age in which our enemies' faces are not known to us, and betrayal and deceit are encountered at every turn. The need for a strong, battle-ready navy has never been greater.\

\In order to complete production as swiftly as possible, we have placed an open order for supplies, and have authorised the Mundjiga Patrons of Law to reward pilots who deliver materials to our base of operations at Sagan Port. I implore all those who are loyal to the Empire to support this operation.\

The campaign begins on the 21st of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Upgrading Greeboski's Outpost
Chancellor Zahra Arias of the Sovereign Justice Collective has announced plans to upgrade the infrastructure and defensive viability of Greeboski's Outpost in the Phiagre system. In a statement, Chancellor Arias said:

\Greeboski's Outpost is a bastion for the people of Phiagre and a monument to our independence, and I consider it my duty to upgrade the starport's services. I have therefore placed an open order for titanium so we can begin the improvement programme.\

Chancellor Arias also called on the Pilots Federation to support Sovereign Justice Collective forces by protecting traders delivering titanium to Greeboski's Outpost. Pilots who hand in bounty vouchers or deliver titanium to the starport will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on the 21st of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Weekly Democracy Report
This report presents the latest data on democratic activity among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to hold elections:

Endr Dominion

LP 329-20 and Co

Green Party of Bhritzameno

14 i Orionis Indie Union

Revolutionary Heretia League

Independent Ongkandjeri Partnership

LTT 18486 Jet Energy Company

Navajoar Fortune Corporation

People's Omicron Ursae Majoris Partnership

Djuhty and Co

Elections occur when two minor factions with a similar political structure resolve a conflict over ownership and influence within a system.


* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay weekly report summarises the recent activities of the Federation, Empire, the Alliance, and in Independent spheres of influence.

The Federation:

President Hudson was flooded with intelligence reports from Federal agencies in Contien this week, but Federal task forces were recalled when an extensive Alliance diplomatic convoy operating in the Kaukai area was discovered.

Shadow President Winters was unable to secure agreements with the citizens of HIP 50489 or Kappa. As a result, Federal aid has been redirected from both systems to Ch'iang Fei and LTT 5964.

The Empire:

The HR 4720 system was cleansed of criminal activity by a Shield of Justice blitz, ensuring Imperial justice will prevail in the system. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's private security fleet now operates in 67 star systems.

Senator Zemina Torval added the infrastructure of the Candecama system to her enterprises this week, but no additional acquisitions are planned for next week.

Princess Aisling Duval's public support was substantially undermined this week, jeopardizing support for the People's Princess in the Aluriates, Blod, Erisha, HIP 116710 and Karakasis systems.

Admiral Denton Patreus saw an arms deal with the Medzistha system fall through. In the coming week, many of his backers are likely to support the construction of a new Majestic-class Interdictor in the Mundjiga system.

The Alliance:

The Alliance's economic outlook improved significantly this week, providing numerous opportunities to restore broken trade agreements and create opportunities for economic expansion. Alliance diplomats are seeking to secure exclusive trade agreements with several Federal systems in addition to some independent systems, partly in response to corporate Federal blockades of Alliance trading hubs. The targeted systems include Akheilos, Aranbarahun, Beta Hydri, CD-27 5409, FAUST 3566, Gendalla, and Kaukai.

Independents:

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was unable to acquire sufficient assets in Chang O to bring it under Sirius' exclusive control, and no new deals are likely to cross his desk next week.

Utopia was able to secure new supporters in Anouphis or LP 708-253, bringing the number of key systems controlled by Simguru Pranav Antal to 50.

Criminal elements backed by the Kumo Crew have instigated violent insurrections in the 7 Zeta-2 Lyrae, Dhanchu, HIP 103138 and San Guan systems. With the major powers seemingly turning a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the Pirate Lord Archon Delaine, the Kumo Crew is likely to swell its number of strongholds to 46.

* Freelance Report: Bond Hub Out of the Woods
Following weeks of tireless meta-alloy harvesting, a team working under the direction of Professor D Luffy at Bond Hub in the Varati system has finally been able to match the success achieved by the teams at Obsidian Orbital.

In a brief interview, Professor Luffy said:

\We knew it was only a matter of time before we managed to get Bond Hub fully operational again, but it took many Commanders to get us there. We can't thank everyone enough for the hours they've spent transporting meta-alloys between the Pleiades and Varati \u2013 a journey that's by no means easy!\

Other affected stations have renewed their appeals for meta-alloys, no doubt hoping that this nuisance will soon be eradicated from our lives.

Commander Lord Zoltan


* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Comments on Palin's Retirement
Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has expressed solidarity with Professor Ishmael Palin, following the latter's decision to retire from the Palin Institute and pursue personal research into the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys.

\It is unfortunate that the professor has been forced to make this decision, but given the existence of the 'dark forces' to which he refers, I support him wholeheartedly.\

\I have long been concerned that there are people out there with greater knowledge of the UAs and meta-alloys, and with darker intentions. The secretive convoys, Palin's abduction, the unexplained increases in the black market value of UAs, the purchase of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of meta-alloys at Obsidian Orbital, and the death threats I received \u2013 all are troubling.\

\We mourn the fact that scientists feel the need to retreat to continue their work, but I look forward to visiting the professor on Maia A 3 a.\

Command Lord Zoltan


* Freelance Report: Gilya Signature Weapons Return to Markets
Gilya Signature Weapons, a rare trade commodity prohibited in a number of jurisdictions, are once again in production at Bell Orbital in the Gilya system. The development is the result of intervention from various commercial interests, priests from Sacra Oculus, and the independent Commanders of the Pilots Federation.

A spokesman for the Gilya Law Party said: \The return of this extremely sought-after commodity has made Gilya an independent and commercially profitable high tech system.\

In addition to Gilya Signature Weapons, the system now produces progenitor cells and combat stabilizers, and has two lucrative black markets.

* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This report presents the latest data on conflict among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a civil war:

Gandje Organisation

League of Kappa

Kappa Public PLC

Gandje Future

Revolutionary Party of Asgarage\t

Asgarage Life Interstellar

Defence Force of Puikis

Puikis Jet Hand Gang

Audumasi Silver Rats

Audumasi Gold Natural Holdings

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

Traditional Njirus Conservatives

The Brotherhood of the Dark Circle

Gongalungul Empire League

Muracing Crimson Boys

Crimson Transport Ltd

LTT 4835 Collective

Revolutionary Party of Wolf 1316

Movement for Oeng Zhaob Alliance

Perkana Solutions

Sairre Posse

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Loyal Imperials Support Starship Construction
The construction of a Majestic-class Interdictor in the Mundjiga system requires generous quantities of tantalum, gallium and indium. Threats of piracy and violent protest have already reached the system.

To counter these threats, a collective of former security contractors known as the Praetorians have committed their forces to defending Mundjiga and the traders operating there. Loren's Legion, an extension of the Prism defence force, will operate jointly with the Praetorians, protecting traders sourcing tantalum from Prism.

Duke Alden Rowe, leader of the Praetorians, gave the following statement to the press:

\Loyal members of the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, we cannot permit interference with the construction of this critical asset. We must enforce Imperial law and the will of Admiral Patreus by protecting vessels delivering cargo to Sagan Port. We will be a shield for this new Interdictor until it is ready to be a shield for the Empire.\

Commander Corrigendum, Loren's Legion


* Freelance Report: Following the Breadcrumbs
Imperial investigator Cornelius Gendymion has released a statement to the Prism Herald addressing accusations that Imperial agents were responsible for the destruction of Starship One.

\It seems Federal Times reporter Elaine Boyd's investigations are being ignored by her countrymen. You may recall that she highlighted the suspicious deaths of key individuals involved in both the Antares and Starship One investigations before her alleged suicide. Her data detailed an off-the-books investigation into the Antares by Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, and also alleged that he was murdered.\

\Congressman George Fallside's apparent foreknowledge of Smeaton's death was waved away, but I suspect Jacob Harris might have better luck finding Starship One's saboteurs if he searched within the Federation \u2013 perhaps starting with folks who have ties to Core Dynamics.\

Commander Corrigendum | Loren's Legion


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Aapelinja Silver Vision Inc

Canary Mining Corporation

Uniting HIP 103438

LHS 1505 Life Ltd

HIP 18725 Purple Allied Industry

Liberate Ceos

Corin Jet State Corporation

LPM 752 Industries

Progressive Party of GD 140

UGP 64 Jet Travel and Co

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.


* Freelance Report: Explorers Contribute to Mapping Project
For several weeks, explorers have been gathering at the Institute of Galactic Exploration and Research at Kippax Ring in the HIP 72043 system. The system has become a hub for explorers contributing to the Sagittarius-Carina Mission, a project to chart the Sagittarius-Carina Arm from its root at the galactic core to its tip at the galactic rim.

Organised by the First Great Expedition, the mission is open to all pilots \u2013 the only requirement being that they own a ship and can dare to dream.

\We have a strong support network, an amazing list of places to visit, and vast regions of uncharted territory to explore. What we don't have is a schedule. Anyone can jump in any time, at any stage of the journey,\ said one member of the FGE.

Commander Corbin Moran


* Freelance Report: Kessel Run Episode II
The Buckyball Racing Club has organised a second 'Kessel Run' race in celebration of the antique film series 'Star Wars'. Although the interstellar travel depicted in the films is now an everyday fact of life, they still fascinate a large proportion of the galactic community.

Participants will depart from George Lucas in Leesti on the 30th of April and visit every station bearing the name 'Kessel' before reaching Solo Orbiter in Altair. The competition will run until the 15th of May.

* Freelance Report: Happy Canonn Day!
Dr Arcanonn, head of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has been released a statement to the media:

\A year ago today, I inadvertently started what is now known as a paragon of independent science: the Canonn Interstellar Research Group.\

\Since then, my colleagues and our associates have led the way in Unknown Artefact research: discovering and decoding the Artefacts' Morse code signal, identifying the UA 'shell' around the Merope system in the Pleiades, and, more recently, researching the barnacles discovered on five planets in the Pleiades \u2013 work that still continues, with new barnacles being found every week.\

\I think the next year will see us answer some of the outstanding questions, but also uncover more mysteries. If so, you can be certain we will be there, working from our lab in Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43, and lifting the veil for the rest of humanity.\

* Galactic News: New Imperial Ship Complete
Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the Imperial campaign to construct a new Majestic-Class Interdictor is now complete. A spokesperson for the Mundjiga Patrons of Law, which helped to coordinate the construction effort, confirmed that the galactic community had responded enthusiastically to the initiative, resulting in the delivery of thousands of tonnes of essential materials.

Lieutenant Severin, who oversaw the project, issued a brief statement to the media:

\The public's response to this campaign has been extremely heartening. The Empire faces many threats, but its ability to meet those threats has now been considerably strengthened. On behalf of myself and Admiral Patreus I would like to thank all those who supported this initiative.\


* Galactic News: Greeboski's Outpost Campaign Concludes
The Sovereign Justice Collective has released a jubilant statement, confirming that it has received sufficient quantities of titanium to carry out its upgrade programme at Greeboski's Outpost. Hundreds of independent pilots responded to the appeal by delivering the much-needed material to the Phiagre system starport.

Chancellor Zahra Arias, spokesperson for the Sovereign Justice Collective, released a brief statement:

\We are immeasurably grateful for the support of the galactic community. The success of this campaign means a brighter future for the people of Phiagre, and an outpost with state-of-the-art services and facilities. Now if you'll excuse me, there's work to be done!\


* Community Goal: Jasmina Halsey Appeals for Exploration Data
Since being discharged from the medical centre at Leoniceno Orbital, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has repeatedly spoken about the allegedly transcendent experiences she had while drifting through space.

The former leader purports to have seen \the true architects of creation\ and to have been shown what she describes as \the infinities of the cosmos\ \u2013 assertions that, along with her slowed speech, have seen her condemned as mentally unstable by some commentators.

Now the former president has launched an appeal for exploration data that she hopes will validate her claims. According to a member of her personal staff, the former leader believes the data will prove there are super-intelligent beings living in the depths of space.

The former Federal president released a brief statement to the media:

\They are out there. I have seen them. We must put aside our petty differences and work together to establish contact. There is so much we could learn from them.\

The Azaleach Partnership has agreed to coordinate the campaign on Halsey's behalf, and to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Leoniceno Orbital. The appeal begins on the 28th of April 3302 and will run for one week.


* Community Goal: Morrina in Need
The people of the Morrina system have endured considerable hardship recently, first at the hand of criminal gangs and then as a result of widespread civil unrest. Although a recent military operation succeeded in eliminating the agitators operating in the system, much of Morrina has been badly affected by the conflict, and many citizens are suffering from a lack of water and power.

In response to this, the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has launched an appeal for essential supplies in order to undo the damage caused by the extended conflict. The organisation has placed an open order for basic medicines, water purifiers and power generators, and has promised to generously reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Beaumont Dock.

Organisation spokespersons Commander Saool and Commander Dennehy released the following statement:

\For the past month, the Morrina system has been embroiled in conflict. The galactic community stepped up to help cull the criminal elements ravaging the system, and the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has started to repair planetary infrastructure and restore power to the night side of tidally locked Morrina 3. But we need more supplies to get the system back on its feet.\

The campaign begins on the 28th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay weekly report summarises the recent activities of the Federation, Empire, Alliance and Independent spheres of influence.

The Federation:

Federal fleets, under the direction of President Zachary Hudson, focused primarily on protecting Federal border systems this week. The coming week brings promise of conflict, as Federal military contractors seek to establish a permanent presence in 26 Ophiuchi and Orishvati.

Though Ch'iang Fei ultimately rejected Shadow President Winters' efforts to secure support for the Liberal party, citizens in LTT 5964 were much more receptive. Djanharu, HIP 50489 and LHS 2205 are currently the focal points of comprehensive Federal aid campaigns.

The Empire:

With the exception of Princess Aisling Duval's territory, the political climate in the Empire remained relatively stable this week. The citizens of Aluriates, Erisha, HIP 116710 and Karakasis withdrew their formal support from the People's Princess, reducing the number of systems under her sway to 56.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's staff investigated a number of systems this week, ultimately settling on Hyades Sector IC-K b9-4 and Kherthaje as the subject of the coming week's anti-criminal efforts. The Shield of Justice is already active in both systems.

Since there were no acquisitions on the table this week, Senator Zemina Torval's agents focused their efforts on establishing good relations in HIP 88178 and Mantunt. Having had some success, Senator Torval's brokers are now looking to purchase assets in both systems.

Senator Denton Patreus' forces were largely tied up protecting the new Majestic-Class Interdictor under construction in Mundjiga. Patreus' fleets have since been dispatched to Ts'ai Shai, and are expected to remain active there for a week.

The Alliance:

Alliance diplomats clocked up thousands of light years this week, diligently pursuing trade ties with seven key systems. New trade relationships were established with Akheilos, Aranbarahun, FAUST 3566 and Gendalla. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is pursuing trade partnerships in 3 Upsilon Ophiuchi, Bingui, Gitse, Kaal, LFT 820, Marralteki, Mongatha, Ross 860 and Tricorii. Should diplomatic efforts in all nine systems prove fruitful, the Alliance trade network will boast a total of 99 commercial hubs.

Independents:

Utopian agitators prevailed in violent protests in the HIP 10584 system, and a Utopian embassy has subsequently been established there. Simguru Pranav Antal's supporters are currently active in Allowa, Antanyamai, HIP 6943 and Maia. Should these systems join Utopia, Antal's influence will extend to a total of 55 key systems.

The Kumo Crew's insurrections in 7 Zeta-2 Lyrae, Dhanchu and HIP 103138 were suppressed, but authorities in the San Guan system were brought under the control of Pirate Lord Archon Delaine. The Kumo Crew has now shifted its efforts to Latugara and Ross 151.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui leveraged his connections with Sirius Corp to encourage spending and investment in Babaradhbh and Chang O. Corporate vessels have been dispatched to begin buying up private and government assets in an attempt to establish a permanent Sirius Gov presence.

* Freelance Report: Keeping an Eye on Naval Expansion
On the popular independent talk show 'Affairs of State', political commentator Walter Astoria defended the recent construction of a new Alliance outpost while expressing concern about Federal and Imperial naval expansion.

\Who cares if the new Alliance outpost is a listening post? The Federation and Empire are building capital ships, and they feel threatened by an outpost? Give me a break!\

\Federal shipyards have been running at maximum capacity since President Hudson's inauguration. Since then, the Federation's only noteworthy naval action was in Kausalya against Emperor's Dawn.\

\It may be less troubling to see the Empire replenishing its forces, given its prolonged campaign against Emperor's Dawn, but a new battle group built around a new Majestic is clearly an attempt to maintain the status quo.\

\Review your history \u2013 there aren't many examples of arms races cultivating peace and mutual understanding. This doesn't bode well.\

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Galactic News: Morrina Aid Campaign Reaches Conclusion
The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has announced that its campaign to bring relief to the people of the Morrina system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a deluge of deliveries to Beaumont Dock. The medicines, water purifiers and power generators delivered to the station will now be distributed to those affected by the system's recent conflicts.

Following the success of the campaign, a spokesperson for Spinward Marches Alliance Concern released a brief statement:

\We would like to extend our sincere thanks to members of the Pilots Federation who gave so generously of their time and resources. Today marks the beginning of a brighter future for the people of Morrina. As the system stabilises, we will turn to the goals of terraforming Morrina 4 and establishing exploration outposts deep in the Orion Arm.\


* Galactic News: Exploration Data Appeal Reaches Conclusion
The office of Jasmina Halsey has announced that the former president's appeal for exploration data has reached a successful conclusion. Although Halsey's claims of transcendent experiences have been dismissed by much of the political elite, the wider galactic community was more receptive, with hundreds of independent pilots taking to their ships to gather exploration data for Halsey's appeal.

In the wake of the appeal's success, a member of Halsey's personal staff released a statement to the media:

\On behalf of President Halsey, I would like to thank all those who supported this appeal. The data you submitted will now be analysed to determine if it can tell us more about the beings seen by President Halsey. With luck, this investigation will set us on a path to making contact with these extraordinary beings.\


* Community Goal: Tantalum for the Wyrd Raiders
The Wyrd Raiders may not be widely known outside the Wyrd system, but for several years it has been one of the most successful commercial enterprises in its region of space, enjoying profitable relationships with an array of partners. Now, the organisation has issued an appeal to the galactic community for help in compiling an order of tantalum for an unnamed party.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement to the media:

\Ordinarily we would have no difficulty meeting an order of this kind, but given the relative urgency of the request, we have decided to place an open order for the necessary materials. Naturally we will generously reward those who lend us their support.\

The spokesperson was asked to address rumours that the tantalum was in fact intended for a group of independent engineers, but she refused to be drawn on the subject:

\Our partners usually prefer to keep their identities private, since their transactions are often of a commercially sensitive nature. I'm sure you understand.\

The Wyrd Raiders has promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum to Gareth Edwards Park in the Wyrd system. The campaign begins on the 5th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Jaques' Big Jump
Equipped with a cluster of drive engines, Jaques Station is noted for being the galaxy's only travelling starport. Owned and operated by a cyborg known as 'Jaques', the Orbis station has been roaming the galaxy for over 40 years, and in that time it has become something of a cultural icon. Now, after more than four decades of travel, Jaques is about to embark on his most ambitious expedition yet \u2013 a long-distance jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point.

In a statement, Jaques explained the thinking behind the venture.

\Well, I've been wandering the galaxy for over forty years now, and the truth is that after a while, travel starts to lose its allure. You've got to remember, I've been alive for several centuries. The things that used to excite you just sort of...lose their spark. I thought a long-distance leap might rekindle my enthusiasm.\

Naturally, moving a starport such a considerable distance requires a significant amount of fuel, which is why Jaques has turned to celebrated search-and-rescue organisation the Fuel Rats for help. The Fuel Rats, in turn, have issued an appeal to their many members and supporters to contribute fuel to Jaques's operation. The Fuel Rats Mischief, which is coordinating the operation, has promised to generously reward those who support the operation.

The campaign begins on the 5th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey to Undergo Psychiatric Review
A member of Jasmina Halsey's personal staff has announced that the former president's appeal for exploration data failed to uncover any evidence of the entities she claims to have seen. The campaign yielded a huge quantity of exploration data, but despite being subjected to extensive examination, the information did not yield any proof of Halsey's assertions.

The spokesperson went on to say that the former Federal president had been admitted to a secure psychiatric facility on Mars for \extended care and review\. This announcement follows weeks of speculation concerning Halsey's mental health, which was called into question by commentators both within and outside the Federation.

Halsey's spokesperson declined to answer journalists' questions.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

* Freelance Report: Conspiracy Theorist Defends Halsey
Notorious conspiracy theorist Ricardo Bentonio, speaking from the Groombridge 34 system, has issued a statement of support for former Federal president Jasmina Halsey:

\They're calling Halsey crazy, but she may just be a modern-day Joan of Arc \u2013 a conduit chosen by the Architects of Creation to speak to mankind. The powers-that-be want to silence her by locking her away. I demand that I and a small group of scientists be granted an audience with President Halsey so we can find out the truth.\

Bentonio recently made headlines after issuing a plea for cartographic data to prove that the 29th of February was an 'aberrant day' heralding the imminent collapse of the universe. What Mr Bentonio did with that data, and whether it helped to prove or disprove his theories, has not been released to the public.

* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Ross 490 Blue Public Corp.

Potriambunn Jet Clan

Aulin Focus

Tian Xian Inc

Xhosag General Corporation

HIP 3142 Empire Consulate

Tetrian Fortune Network

LTT 8856 Purple Netcoms Group

Regir Boys

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Cayutorme for Equality

CD-63 201 Travel Solutions

Paladin Consortium

Metzili Autocracy

64 Arietis Jet General Solutions

Order of Njorog

Njorog Jet Dynamic Industry

LTT 9577 Crimson Clan

WISE 1800+0134 Jet Partnership

Posse of Polevnic

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.

* Galactic News: Tantalum Appeal Extended
The Wyrd Raiders have announced that their campaign for tantalum has been extended. A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed that this was to ensure targets would be met.

In a brief statement, the spokesperson said:

\We are extremely grateful for the support we have received so far. But it is clear that for this campaign to succeed, we will need to give pilots more time to source the tantalum we have asked for.\

The campaign is now scheduled to end on the 19th of May 3302.


* Galactic News: Jaques to Embark for Beagle Point
A spokesperson for The Fuel Rats named Mischief has announced that Jaques Station has received sufficient quantities of fuel to complete the proposed jump to Beagle Point.

Jaques, the starport's owner and operator, confirmed that the station received hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fuel over the course of the week-long campaign. In a statement, the cyborg expressed his pleasure at the initiative's success.

\It's a terrific response, it really is. We haven't even set off yet and already I'm excited! Obviously there's lots of prep to be done \u2013 we can't just go leaping into the black \u2013 but we should be ready pretty soon.\

Jaques Station is expected to depart for Beagle Point in the next few days.


* Community Goal: Ishmael Palin Launches Appeal
Last month, Professor Ishmael Palin announced his intention to retire from The Palin Institute, the research organisation he founded in 3301. In a statement, the professor indicated that he would relocate to a small research centre on Maia A 3 a, where he would continue investigating the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys. Now, the professor has issued a further statement, announcing that he has placed an open order for building fabricators for the construction of the new outpost.

\The galactic community has given me considerable support over the past few months \u2013 even going so far as to rescue me and my team from pirates in the Orulas system \u2013 and I would very much like for them to be part of this initiative. The new research centre will be relatively modest, but there is still a need for materials. I can promise that pilots who deliver the necessary supplies will be generously compensated!\

The Defence Party of Nespeleve, which is coordinating the effort on behalf of Professor Palin, has promised to reward pilots who deliver building fabricators to Wilkes Orbital in the Nespeleve system. The organisation has also promised to reward Commanders who eliminate hostiles operating in the system, to ensure those delivering building fabricators can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 12th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Skvortsov Orbital Explorers' Gala
With the successful conclusion of the Distant Worlds Expedition looming, intrepid explorers both within and without the bubble are turning to the bubbly, and O'Malligan's Coffee Bar at Skvortsov Orbital has announced plans to throw a party for the returning travellers. A spokesperson for the establishment said:

\What does an explorer want after they've returned to the bubble, stumbled out of their ship and cashed in at Universal Cartographics? A drink or two! So we're throwing the party of the century to celebrate the achievements of the Distant Worlds pilots, and other intrepid explorers.\

O'Malligan's Coffee Bar has approached the Diamond Frogs, the system's controlling faction, for assistance in making the party a reality. But the Diamond Frogs' chief logistics officer, Commander Paramemetic, said: \There's no way O'Malligan's is going to be able to throw a radical party without support from the Pilots Federation. Diamond Frogs pilots alone will consume all of O'Malligan's stock within a matter of hours.\

To ensure the celebration is worthy of the accomplishments of the Distant Worlds team, the Diamond Frogs have promised to reward pilots who bring alcohol and other recreational substances to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system.

The campaign begins on the 12th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Freelance Report: Looking for Peace, or War?
Dr Derthek, a founding member of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has embarked on an ambitious project to map NGC 6357, also known as the War and Peace Nebula, in its entirety.

Before departing, Dr Derthek gave a brief interview explaining his motivation:

\I've examined the Unknown Artefacts, I've seen the barnacles, I've even completed a circumnavigation of the galaxy. But the estimated 13,000 systems of NGC 6357 have always fascinated me. It's one of the most prominent sites of massive-star formation close to the bubble.\

\I think there's something out there, although I don't know what. But it'll be my home until my ship, the RSV Canonn, has visited every single system. I might find more barnacles, more UAs, or something entirely new. Who knows?\

Hundreds of fellow scientists have sent messages of support, and Universal Cartographics is understood to be eagerly awaiting Derthek's return.

* Powerplay: Weekly Report
The Powerplay weekly report summarises recent activity in Federal, Imperial, Alliance and Independent spheres of influence.

The Federation

Under the pretence of tightening security, President Zachary Hudson's fleets were deployed to the Ravas system where they established a forward operating base. The movement of the Federal ships led to a supply shortage in 26 Ophiuchi, threatening the combat readiness of the fleet stationed there. Only a continued show of Federal might will be enough to ensure law and order prevail.

Shadow President Felicia Winters focused her Federal aid campaigns on the Kali system, in an attempt to demonstrate how Liberal values will bring a better life to all. Kali has been controlled by the Alliance-aligned Green Party of Kali for some time, but Blue Netcoms Ltd \u2013 a Federal corporation \u2013 is likely to gain influence with the increased Federal presence.

The Empire

Shield of Justice logistics failed to allocate sufficient resources to systems throughout Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's domain, resulting in a loss of control in HIP 47328 and HR 4720. If the Shield of Justice cannot adequately garrison the Emperor's systems, Cook and HIP 10694 will follow suit.

Princess Aisling Duval's backers acquired controlling stakes in media networks throughout the Conii system this week, and a repeat of last week's successes is now being attempted in Ekono and Kurichime.

Using her economic connections and vast wealth, Senator Zemina Torval's brokers collected deeds to purchase both land and infrastructure in Jamuxa and Belgitan, allowing her to acquire a controlling interest in both systems.

Senator Denton Patreus despatched his fleets to Ehi, an anarchic system controlled by the Ehi Silver Rats. Although resistance to the Imperial presence was crushed, budgetary considerations forced Imperial fleets to withdraw.

The Alliance

Agents of Prime Minister Edmund Mahon undertook diplomatic missions in BPM 89444, 7 Zeta-2 Lyrae and Alkaid, and successfully forged trade agreements with these systems. Alliance representatives have a busy week ahead of them, with negotiations underway in a total of nine systems. If all nine were to join the Alliance trade network, Prime Minister Mahon would have ties with 106 systems.

Independents

Violent insurrections in HIP 103138, He Xian Gu, HIP 90190 and Bakabienil compelled system defence forces to mobilize in an attempt to clean up the corrupt influences seeking to take control. Security forces successfully repulsed the Kumo Crew in the latter three systems, while resistance in HIP 103138 proved too weak. Resistance fighters have paid the inevitable price in blood, and their families have been sold into slavery.

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui leveraged connections with Sirius Corp. to secure investment from the population of Artume. Vast funds were allocated to buy up a controlling interest in the system. Unfortunately, an eleventh-hour financial review revealed the system to be unprofitable, and the acquisition was terminated on Thursday morning.

Utopian enforcers were unable to liberate the people of 63 G. Capricorni and Kelie from misguided bureaucrats resisting the truth of Utopia. Undeterred, negotiators have sent out feelers for new opportunities to share the vision of Utopia.

Arlo Cortez, a member of Jasmina Halsey's personal staff, has responded to a recent statement from Ricardo Bentonio, the notorious conspiracy theorist. In an official press release, Cortez said:

\The suggestion that Jasmina has been somehow 'silenced' by oppressive governmental powers is patently ridiculous. The decision to admit Jasmina to the Clearwater Clinic was made by her friends and family. No one else was involved.\

Cortez also said that Bentonio's request to meet with Halsey would not be granted:

\Our paramount concern is that Jasmina receives the care and attention she needs. She will not be meeting with members of the press, representatives of the Federation, or crackpot conspiracy theorists.\

* Freelance Report: Distant Worlds Flagship Anticipates Jaques' Arrival
Preparations are underway for the Distant Worlds Expedition gala at Skvortsov Orbital, but one explorer will be unable to attend: Commander Olivia Vespera, pilot of the expedition's fleet flagship, a Type-9 named Zombie Wasp IV.

At the time of writing, Commander Vespera is still at Beagle Point, prospecting for the necessary materials to synthesize 'jumponium', a colloquial moniker given by explorers to frame shift drive injection. Without it, Vespera will be unable to return home.

But Commander Vespera is unconcerned \u2013 in fact, she's jubilant.

\I got a message saying that Jaques Station is coming to Beagle Point. I might actually be the first to meet him here!\

* Freelance Report: Protesters Petition for Halsey's Freedom
One year ago today, Federal President Jasmina Halsey and Vice-President Ethan Naylor embarked on a tour of Federation frontier systems. Two weeks later, Starship One was declared missing with all hands. Despite initial assessments that the ship would never be found, the remains of the vessel were located and a handful of survivors recovered, including former president Halsey.

Although Halsey had many political opponents, she also had many supporters. Some of these supporters have assembled outside the psychiatric facility on Mars where Halsey is currently located, waving signs and chanting various slogans, seeking her release.

Rachel Young, one of the most vociferous of the former president's supporters, made this statement to on-site reporters:

\President Halsey worked hard for the Federation. She deserves to be with her family. She deserves the respect and protection any former president is entitled to, not to be locked up in the funny farm.\

Federal law enforcement is monitoring the protest to ensure it remains peaceful.

* Galactic News: Felicia Winters Comments on Halsey's Committal
At a recent event at the Mars Business Society, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters responded to a question concerning the hospitalisation of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey:

\It was clear from the outset that she'd experienced a traumatic event, and that it impacted her psychologically as well as physically. I hope she receives the treatment she needs.\

When asked about Halsey's alleged mystical experiences, Winters replied:

\Frankly, I find the question distasteful. She has undergone a harrowing experience \u2013 an experience that would have affected even the strongest of us \u2013 and drawing attention to her so-called 'visions' is counterproductive to restoring her mental health.\

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Undines Purple Comms Int

Kolyawa Jet Life Systems

Leaders of Pand

Pand Inc

Uszaa Society

Xuanduna Purple Syndicate

Cordenet Jet Ring

HIP 43296 Blue Major Ltd

GCRV 1568 Law Party

Independent Iapo Vuh for Equality

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Puritanical Organisation Targets Traders
Earlier this week, private security firm the Diamond Frogs issued a request for liquor and other legal narcotics to be delivered to Skvortsov Orbital in 63 G. Capricorni for a massive party celebrating the success of the Distant Worlds Expedition. Independent traders throughout civilized space have responded enthusiastically to the appeal, but it would appear not everyone wants to share in the festivities.

Recent reports indicate that an extremist temperance organisation from the nearby system of Eravate has been interdicting and destroying merchants attempting to deliver legal intoxicants to Skvortsov Orbital. Although only minor casualties have been reported, representatives from the Diamond Frogs have expressed concern about the social unrest in Eravate spilling over into neighbouring sectors.

Commander Paramemetic, the Diamond Frogs' chief logistics officer, said that the security firm would take steps to ensure the safety of traders making deliveries. \It's a shame these puritanical troublemakers are trying to steal the spotlight from the explorers,\ he said, \but we'll make sure they don't interfere with the celebrations.\

* Community Goal: The Battle for Neits
\We were escorting a cargo ship to Watson Settlement. As we approached, we were intercepted by a pair of Vultures. They asked us to identify ourselves, but I don't think they were even listening \u2013 they just opened fire. The cargo ship took a hit, and then my wingmate bought it. I barely made it out alive.\

This testimony comes from the Neits system, which has become the site of intense conflict in the past 24 hours. Authorities in the system have confirmed that a Federal organisation known as Neits Jet Life Ltd has deployed ships throughout the system, and is attacking other vessels at the slightest provocation. Meanwhile, the GR 316 Silver Universal Group, an Imperial organisation, has despatched fighters to counter the Federal offensive.

Neits has long been a contentious territory due to its position between Imperial and Federal space. The system has always tried to maintain its independence, resisting both Federal and Imperial overtures, but many suspected it was only a matter of time before one of the superpowers made a grab for power.

Neither the Federation nor the Empire has made an official statement on the matter, with both Federal President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval remaining silent. But one inhabitant of the system was happy to provide an opinion on the situation:

\It's no secret that tensions have been rising between the Feds and the Empire recently, so I guess conflict was bound to break out sooner or later. Trouble is, when the superpowers start throwing punches, there tends to be a lot of collateral damage. By the time they're done fighting, there might not be much of Neits left.\

Both Neits Jet Life Ltd and the GR 316 Silver Universal Group have promised to reward pilots who support their campaigns. The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 19th of May 3302.


* Galactic News: Let the Festivities Commence
The Diamond Frogs have announced that their campaign to bring party supplies to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. A huge number of deliveries were made for the explorers' gala, which will celebrate the achievements of the Distant Worlds explorers.

A spokesperson for the Diamond Frogs released a brief statement:

\We knew O'Malligan's would throw a fine party, but we're delighted to have received the support we needed to become the galaxy's number one party spot. Explorers will now spread word of this party to the galactic rim. We couldn't be happier.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital.


* Community Goal: Battle Royale
Don Antonaci, leader of the pirate organisation Wolf 359, has called on the galaxy's pirates to assemble for a faceoff against the Hutton Orbital Truckers and their allies. The pirate has proposed an 'anything goes' battle royale in the Wyrd system.

Minelayers, thermal weapons, torpedo boats, long-range sniper ships \u2013 Antonaci is asking participants to bring their most devastating equipment to the ice rings, and to destroy any truckers they encounter. The truckers, meanwhile, have promised to send their finest to oppose Antonaci.

The two parties have agreed that the pirates will fly Fer-De-Lances, Cobras, Vipers and Eagles, while the truckers will pilot Federal Assault Ships, Gunships, Dropships and Vultures. Pilots on both sides have been authorised to target anyone who piloting a larger vessel. Camera crews, which will be flying yellow haulers, are considered off limits.

Antonaci released the following statement:

\Despite my best efforts, these filthy truckers continue to trawl through space. We want all pilots friendly to the Don to help us teach these truckers a lesson. Bring your finest weapons, modules and upgrades, and show your support.\

The truckers' only response to Antonaci's challenge was: \Bring it on!\

The campaign begins on the 19th of May 3302 and will run for one week. Pilots who support the operation will be generously reimbursed.


* Galactic News: Palin's Appeal Concludes
The Defence Party of Nespeleve has announced that Professor Ishmael Palin's appeal for building fabricators has been positively received by the galactic community. Large quantities of the equipment have been delivered to Wilkes Orbital over the past week for the construction of a new research outpost on Maia A 3 a. In a statement, Professor Palin extended his gratitude to those who supported the campaign:

\I am extremely grateful to all the pilots who contributed to this initiative. Now that the necessary materials are in place, I will begin preparing for the next phase of the project. There is still much to be done before I am ready to depart for Maia A 3 a, but with luck it will not take long.\

\Of course, I don't intend to spend all my time on Maia A 3 a studying Unknown Artefacts \u2013 I have always enjoyed tinkering with starships, and I plan to spend some time doing just that!\

Professor Palin is expected to depart for Maia A 3 a within the week.


* Galactic News: Tantalum Appeal Comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Wyrd Raiders has announced that its campaign for tantalum has been warmly received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Gareth Edwards Park, the organisation's base of operations. In a succinct statement, the spokesperson thanked those who supported the campaign.

\We are very grateful to the many independent pilots who helped us fulfil our commercial obligations. The tantalum will now be delivered to our various partners.\

Since the campaign began, rumours have persisted that the tantalum was destined for a group of independent engineers. The Wyrd Raiders declined to comment on the matter, citing a need to maintain their partners' privacy.

* Galactic News: Malfunctioning Starports Restored with Meta-Alloys
Recent reports indicate that a number of starports forced to suspend services due to Unknown Artefact-related interference have been restored to normality through the application of meta-alloys. Ackerman Market in Eravate, Gabriel Enterprise in Harma, Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis and Onnes Gateway in LFT 37 are all now reported to be fully operational.

This development \u2013 a testament to the hard work of the pilots who have delivered meta-alloys to the affected stations \u2013 will no doubt bring hope to those still affected by the technological plague.

* Freelance Report: Attempt to Sabotage Jaques Station Thwarted
Three individuals carrying pamphlets identifying them as members of 'The Hands of the Architects' have been apprehended at Jaques Station. Starport personnel discovered the individuals attempting to modify the station's frame shift drive.

A station spokesperson said: \The individuals are apparently members of a cult that arose shortly after Jasmina Halsey first claimed to have encountered super-intelligent, non-human life. Materials confiscated from the individuals indicate that they hoped to force a mis-jump during Jaques's forthcoming journey to Beagle Point. Apparently they thought this would give them an opportunity to meet Halsey's 'architects'.\

The would-be saboteurs are currently being held in custody at Jaques Station while starport personnel discuss possible extradition with nearby systems.

* Freelance Report: Diamond Frogs Reportedly Attacking Traders
A Radio Skvortsov commentator recently reported that extremists from the Eravate system were attacking traders running liquor and other legal narcotics to Skvortsov Orbital.

The traders, who hail from all sides of the galaxy, were invited to the system by the Diamond Frogs to supply a party celebrating the return of the Distant Worlds Expedition. But recent reports indicate that the Eravate extremists are not the only ones preying on the traders.

According to these new reports, some Diamond Frog ships are also participating in the piracy. Although there is no evidence that the Diamond Frogs' leaders or prominent Commanders are orchestrating or participating in these attacks, numerous pilots have reported being interdicted by hostile Diamond Frog vessels.

One disgruntled Commander claimed that he had been interdicted multiple times by a number of different Diamond Frog ships. The pilot said: \The dingbats keep pulling me out of supercruise, and it's starting to get annoying! Don't get me wrong, the Diamond Frogs seem like good people, and I'll continue to deliver booze for those brave explorers, but they really need to get their house in order and put a stop to these shenanigans. It's casting a shadow on the whole endeavour.\

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Growing Demand for Halsey's Exploration Data
A demonstration was held today at Leoniceno Orbital in Azaleach calling for the immediate release of all information submitted in response to former Federal president Jasmina Halsey's appeal for exploration data.

\Something isn't right here,\ said one of the demonstrators. \Mountains of data were submitted, and within two days they were able to review it thoroughly enough to declare there was absolutely nothing of interest? This reeks of a cover up.\

Speakers at the rally demanded that the Azaleach Partnership, to which the information was submitted, release the data so its findings could be independently verified.

\Science relies on openness, collaboration and peer review,\ argued one speaker. \It's an integral part of the process. Any conclusions based on secret data should be treated with suspicion.\

* Community Goal: The Skvortsov Orbital Hangover
The party to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Distant Worlds Expedition has been a tremendous success, with festivities at Skvortsov Orbital lasting for several days. But the revelry has come at a cost, as it seems 63 G. Capricorni is now in the grip of a system-wide hangover.

A member of staff at Skvortsov Orbital said: \Those Diamond Frogs really know how to throw a party. Seriously, I've never seen anything like it. At one point, the security chief was dancing on a table and screaming about wanting to be a showgirl.\

The starport's chief of security declined to comment, although rumours that he has resigned his position to fulfil his secret ambitions remain unsubstantiated. His office issued the following statement:

\The celebrations were a great success, but now it's time to clean up. We are therefore asking independent pilots to deliver hazardous environment suits, water purifiers and coffee to help the system get back on its feet.\

The Diamond Frogs have once again stepped in, promising to reward pilots who deliver the much-needed commodities to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system. The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Federation Assumes Control of Neits
After a week of intense conflict, Neits Jet Life Ltd confirmed that its forces have successfully neutralised the GR 316 Silver Universal Group in the Neits system.

The fighting began when ships belonging to the Federation-aligned Neits Jet Life Ltd came under fire from the GR 316 Silver Universal Group, an Imperial organisation. As the conflict escalated, both sides called in support from independent combat pilots, but ultimately it was Neits Jet Life Ltd who emerged victorious.

With the system now under official Federal control, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy released the following statement:

\The remaining GR 316 Silver Universal Group forces have retreated from Neits, allowing Neits Jet Life Ltd to assume control of the system. Neits will now enjoy all the benefits of being an official Federal enclave, including the protection of the Federal Navy.\


* Community Goal: Bringing Peace to Ngolibardu
Authorities in the Ngolibardu system have reported that the number of criminals operating in the area has risen sharply over the past few months. Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.

To counter this threat, Ngolibardu Electronics Solutions has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Ngolibardu system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Vernadsky Port.

The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Alliance Outpost Established in HIP 19072
Last month, the Alliance launched an initiative to establish a new outpost on the fringes of inhabited space. The campaign received the support of hundreds of Alliance-aligned pilots who, along with other members of the galactic community, delivered essential materials and components to the Alliance base at Noti Dock.

Now, Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has announced that the new outpost is complete. In a statement, Mahon said:

\It gives me great pleasure to announce the formal opening of the Cooper Research Centre. In addition to functioning as a base for scientific research, the station will bolster the Alliance's reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering capabilities in a strategically valuable region of space.\

An Alliance spokesperson confirmed that the new outpost would offer reload, repair and refuel services to pilots operating in the HIP 19072 system.


* Galactic News: No Sign of Jaques Station
Two weeks ago it was announced that Jaques Station, the galaxy's most famous travelling starport, would make an incredible long-distance jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point. The proposed expedition received enthusiastic support from the galactic community, which contributed thousands of tonnes of fuel to the ambitious campaign.

But despite setting off almost a week ago, no communications have been received from Jaques Station since it departed, and explorers at Beagle Point have reported no sign of the outpost. Dr Kaii, one of the leaders of the Distant Worlds Expedition, released the following statement:

\I have received numerous updates from pilots in the vicinity of Beagle Point reporting 'no joy' on the Jacques jump. Members of the fleet have searched nearby systems, but there is no sign of the station. A full investigation should be launched as soon as possible.\

Kinsley Larson, an engineering specialist, offered this assessment to the Federal Times:

\I can't say I'm surprised. A leap like that would be a remarkable feat for a starship, never mind a starport. Even if Jaques Station survived the jump, there are countless things that could have gone wrong and caused it to veer off course. It could be almost anywhere in the galaxy. Assuming it's still in one piece, that is.\

A number of Unknown Artefacts had recently been sold at Jaques Station, and the starport was experiencing technical issues at the time it departed for Beagle Point.

* Community Goal: The Dangerous Games Begin
The galaxy is home to countless factions, some boasting thousands of members and others comprising only a handful of individuals. Some exist to serve the galactic community, while others follow more antagonistic dogmas. For almost every creed in human space, there is a corresponding faction.

Recent reports indicate that the largest of these factions have gained such significant levels of power and influence that they are on the cusp of being recognized as powers in their own right. This development coincides with mounting speculation that the empire of Pirate Lord Archon Delaine, once the most formidable power in the Pegasi Sector, is on the brink of collapse.

With a paradigm shift looming, the largest of the galaxy's factions have taken the unprecedented step of organising a semi-official competition for the right to be recognised as an official power. The name of this competition? The Dangerous Games.

Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, elaborated on the nature of the event:

\There are five factions competing in the Dangerous Games: the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Between June and July 3302, these groups will participate in a series of community campaigns, giving the galaxy's independent pilots a chance to support their chosen faction.\

But these will not be the only factions taking part. With the start of the event still some weeks away, a number of smaller factions have begun competing for their chance to participate in the Dangerous Games. In the coming weeks, these factions will attempt to rally Commanders to their respective causes through a series of community-oriented events. Whichever faction successfully dominates its rivals in these 'Wildcard' events will enter the Dangerous Games, competing for the right to join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful.

The first Wildcard event requires pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. The faction with the most gold at the end of the week-long campaign will be declared the victor of the first Wildcard heat. Naturally, pilots are also free to disrupt their rivals' efforts.

The event begins on the 2nd of June 3302 and will run for one week.

* Freelance Report: Fuel Rat Destroyed
A flight recording has surfaced revealing the destruction of a Fuel Rat rescue vessel.

Two Fuel Rat pilots responded to an emergency call and refuelled an apparently stranded Python. One Fuel Rat jumped out of the system, but the Python pilot made his move before the second could follow. The footage shows that the attack was swift and came without warning, and resulted in the destruction of the Fuel Rat vessel.

The attacker claims to have been collecting a bounty set by another Commander, who has denied the claim. Regardless of the ultimate truth, both pilots have since been the target of manhunts. The long-term consequences of this incident remain to be seen.

* Freelance Report: Fresh Fruit Meets Bitter Harvest
Speaking from the Canonn Interstellar Research Institute, Dr Arcanonn has commented on the current state of barnacle research and lauded the discovery of harvesting sites in the California Nebula:

\Once again, the efforts of an independent explorer have resulted in an exciting discovery. Thanks to Commander Wobblytickle's report from California Sector DL-Y D4 C6, the long-suspected presence of barnacles in the California Nebula has now been confirmed.\

But Dr Arcanonn's tone grew notably cooler when speaking about the barnacles of the Pleiades Nebula:

\The loss of several barnacles \u2013 whether through destruction or exhaustion \u2013 is naturally of concern to those of us investigating this enigma.\

* Community Goal: Wildcard Competition Continues
The first stage of the Dangerous Games 'Wildcard' competition is over, and the second is about to begin. For this heat, pilots have been asked to head to the Bjorti system and deploy their hardpoints for a bounty-hunting contest. The faction that accumulates the most bounty vouchers during the week-long event will be declared the winner.

The Dangerous Games Wildcard competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power.

The event begins on the 9th of June 3302 and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: EG Pilots Dominate First Wildcard Event
Last week saw the start of a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's minor factions would earn a place in the forthcoming Dangerous Games. The victor of the so-called 'Wildcard' competition will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power.

The first Wildcard event required pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. Predictably, the week-long event saw no small measure of conflict, with pilots doing everything they could to disrupt their rivals' operations.

The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots received the largest quantity of gold. But whether or not this will result in ultimate victory remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the three-week campaign.


* Galactic News: Order Restored to Mehet
Mehet Ltd has announced that its campaign to clear the Mehet system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Following the success of the operation, Mehet Ltd released a brief statement to the media:

\Thanks to the brave Commanders of the Pilots Federation, Mehet is now free from the depredations of criminals and agitators. On behalf of the people of Mehet, we would like to express our gratitude.\

Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at Schwann Dock.


* Community Goal: Narcotics for the Crom Silver Boys
Those who have explored the trade routes of Wolf 1301 will undoubtedly recall 'wolf fesh', the popular psychoactive drug that was once produced in the system. Although originally legal, when control of the system changed last year the drug was banned, and production was immediately halted. Wolf fesh disappeared from galactic trade routes almost overnight.

But now it seems that the drug is about to make a return. Notorious crime syndicate the Crom Silver Boys, known for targeting traders and miners from their secret base in the Crom system, claim to have procured the secret recipe for the drug, and have announced plans to produce a new variant.

The organisation has already stockpiled the necessary common ingredients, but to begin production it needs a quantity of rarer elements found only in other narcotics. The Crom Silver Boys have therefore placed an open order for the requisite intoxicants, and have promised to reward those who deliver the much-needed goods to Walheim Enterprise in the Herthe system.

Most of the requested commodities are illegal in Herthe, and the system's security forces have vowed to interdict and search any suspicious vessels. The Crom Silver Boys have advised pilots participating in the operation to exercise caution.

The campaign begins on the 9th of June 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Freelance Report: Old Worlds Zero-Gravity Rally
Starport personnel across the Lave cluster are preparing for an increase in traffic, as pilots from the Buckyball Racing Club and the Elite Racers compete in their latest event. The 'Old World Hustle', which combines point-to-point rallies and zero-gravity aerobatics, runs from the 11th to the 19th of June 3302.

Despite being held in low esteem by authorities, both the Buckyball Racing Club and the Elite Racers are privately acknowledged as providing a boost to commerce in systems where their events take place, particularly by the proprietors of station bars and the purveyors of outfitting services.

\Insurance claims are good for business,\ said a salesman at the Lave Station shipyard, before hastily adding \although of course a pilot's safety is our primary concern.\

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Where is Jaques Station?
Jaques Station hit the headlines two weeks ago when it was reported that the galaxy's most famous travelling starport had disappeared. Jaques, the starport's owner and operator, had announced plans to jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point. But when contact with the starport was lost, many feared the ambitious enterprise had resulted in disaster.

Fortunately it seems the starport is still intact, even if its whereabouts remain unknown. Several outposts throughout inhabited space have reported receiving messages over the past 24 hours, suggesting that the cyborg and his travelling starport survived the attempted journey to Beagle Point.

Unfortunately the messages are extremely fragmentary, giving no clear indication of where the starport might be. One of the more complete messages reads as follows:

\...witch-space...drive engines... station infrastructure intact but...we are...\

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.

* Community Goal: Final Stage of Wildcard Competition
With the second stage of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition complete, the third and final stage can now begin.

This phase of the competition will focus on trade, with pilots being asked to gather as many conductive fabrics as possible for their chosen faction. The group with the most conductive fabrics at the end of the week-long event will be declared the winner.

At the close of the Wildcard competition, the faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will enter the Dangerous Games and compete for the right to be recognised as an official power.

With the end of the competition looming, each faction is eager to secure as much support as possible, and is doing all it can to attract pilots to its cause.

The event begins on the 16th of June 3302 and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: EG Pilots Triumph in Second Wildcard Event
The second heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over. For this event, pilots were asked to deploy their hardpoints and gather bounties for their chosen faction in the Bjorti system.

* Galactic News: Narcotics Appeal comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Crom Silver Boys, a notorious crime syndicate, has released a statement confirming that its appeal for narcotics was eagerly received by the galactic community.

Given the illicit nature of the operation, the exact number of participants is not known. But reports from the Herthe system indicate that hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign, delivering controlled substances for the criminals' drug-production scheme.

With the criminals' targets met, production of crom silver fesh is scheduled to begin immediately. The new narcotic will follow the closely guarded recipe for wolf fesh, the psychoactive drug formerly produced in the Wolf 1301 system. The Crom Silver Boys have promised to release the new commodity to the market at Chorel Survey as soon as possible.

Jimmy 'Ice Pick' Falcone, spokesperson for the Crom Silver Boys, released a brief and slightly perplexing statement:

\Crom silver fesh will soon be available to pilots who have proved we can trust them.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Walheim Enterprise in the Herthe system.


* Community Goal: Pranav Antal Requests Exploration Data
Every year, thousands of people disappear into the vastness of space. Some simply venture out too far and lose their way. Others are abducted by pirates and sold into slavery, their identities irrevocably erased. Others still may suffer more mysterious fates.

For many, these disappearances are a fact of life \u2013 an inescapable consequence of living among the stars. But Pranav Antal, leader of the technologically progressive enclave Utopia, is unwilling to simply accept such losses. The simguru, as he is known, has launched a campaign to gather exploration data with the aim of discovering why so many of those who traverse the depths of space vanish.

\The purpose of this campaign is to acquire concrete information about these disappearances so we can do more to prevent them. But I must stress that even if we are able to locate missing individuals, it is likely that they will be too far from our base of operations to make rescue possible. This is an intelligence-gathering operation only.\

Utopian representatives have promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Terry Port in the Garoku system. The campaign begins on the 16th of June 3302 and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: Engineers Reduce Requirements
The 'Rewired' news feed is known for its prodigious output, sometimes releasing hundreds of stories a day. But balancing such productivity with thorough fact checking is a tall order, and the feed's critics sometimes claim that at least half its output consists of redactions, corrections and apologies.

But despite these jibes, only the most obdurate critic would deny that Rewired has broken major stories in the past, its guerrilla style approach allowing it to react faster than some of its larger, more established rivals.

The channel's latest report will interest many of the galaxy's independent pilots:

\Word is that Broo Tarquin will now work with pilots who can bring him 50 units of Fugin Tea, instead of the 100 he used to ask for. And Didi Vatermann's only asking for 50 units of Lavian Brandy, which is a damn sight less than the 200 she previously insisted on. Seems it just got a whole lot easier to spec your ship.\

* Freelance Report: The Crab Nebula Expedition
A fleet of over 400 survey and support vessels has departed from Mitterand Hollow in Epsilon Indi. The Crab Nebula Expedition is the largest coordinated flight of explorers since the Distant Worlds Expedition. It has attracted a wide range of pilots, from veterans to beginners taking their first trip outside the bubble.

The goal of the Expedition is a detailed planetary and mineral survey of tens of thousands of systems outwards of Sol, focusing on the regions around many well-known nebulae. The expedition is expected to reach the Crab Nebula on the 5th of July 3302, with the survey completed and the data returned in early August.

Felicity Farseer and Elvira Martuuk have personally refitted many of the exploration vessels. With both engineers claiming that their designs provide the best performance, this will be a major test for both.

* Freelance Report: Searching for Jaques
It is almost a month since Jaques departed from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point in his specially modified Orbis Starport. Pilots from the Distant Worlds Expedition and the FGE exploration wings have been eagerly awaiting Jaques's arrival.

Jaques's travel time was originally predicted to be about one week, but this time passed with no sign of the space station. Many pilots remained hopeful that Jaques would arrive in time for the end of the Distant Worlds Expedition on the 5th of June, but the closing ceremony was conducted without him.

With the expedition over, anxiety started to take hold of the remaining pilots. Many were depending on Jaques to replenish supplies and make essential repairs for their onward journeys.

Fearing that the starport might have suffered an accident, searches of planets in the Beagle Point region were organised, led by Commander 'Erimus' Kamzel. On the 12th of June, almost twenty pilots conducted an intensive search around the base camp on Darwin's Legacy, covering nearly 20,000 square kilometres, but no sign of the spaceport was found.

The search took place in almost total darkness, at low altitude. Several ships and SRVs suffered damage, and one pilot ran out of fuel, necessitating rescue by the Fuel Rats. With hope all but lost and the risks to pilots becoming ever greater, the search was reluctantly called off.

* Freelance Report: Escalation in Merope?
Following reports of unprovoked assaults on Canonn vessels from Farragut Battle Cruisers in the Merope system, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released the following statement:

\This is a regrettable misstep, and I invite the Federation to explain how these battle cruisers can represent anything other than militarised resource denial. The presence of gun emplacements by as-yet unknown parties was already a cause for concern, and this worrying development smacks of gunboat diplomacy.\

At least eight Farragut Battle Cruisers are understood to have been sighted in Merope, all identified as Federal.

Dr Arcanonn continued: \I am morally compelled to insist on a public inquiry examining the deployment of warships to a system that plays home to an insufficiently understood phenomenon.\

* Freelance Report: Formidine Rifters Seek Help
The Formidine Rifters are an unlikely collective of explorers from various backgrounds, systems and factional allegiances who have put aside their political differences to work together toward a common goal. For several months, they have been working together to map the region between the two farthest galactic arms just past the Heart and Soul Nebula.

Commander Finn McMillan of the Earth Expeditionary Fleet, one of the many Rifters devoted to this project, addressed the galactic exploration community today:

\We would like to invite all explorers dedicated to expanding human knowledge to join us in the Formidine Rift. We have reason to believe that there is something beyond the galactic arm that may change humanity's view of the cosmos, but we simply need more eyes, ears and minds to help us unravel this mystery.\

* Freelance Report: Project Endurance
On the 10th of February 3301, two Faulcon DeLacy Cobras were launched from Allen Platform in the Dijkstra system. Piloted by Commander Dr Simms and Commander Sid Solo, the ships were fitted for an endurance attempt unlike any other. Now, more than 16 months later and having circumnavigated the galactic core, they are about to return to inhabited space.

There have been many changes since they left. Software updates now allow plotting routes of 1,000 light years at a time, improved communications and wing dynamics have facilitated the sharing of exploration data in a manner unprecedented before their departure, and planetary landings are now authorised. Indeed, neither ship is fitted for SRV activity.

What are their feelings as they approach the human sphere? \I'm not sure,\ said Dr Simms. \I'm worried about docking at a space station again. It's been so long since I saw anything other than stars and distant worlds, I'm not sure I remember how to land.\

* Galactic News: EG Pilots win Wildcard Competition
The third and final heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over.

For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to fill their cargo holds with conductive fabrics and deliver them to Tartarus Point for their chosen faction. Hundreds of pilots participated in the event, eager to help their faction secure a place in the Dangerous Games. But ultimately it was the EG Pilots that accumulated the most conductive fabrics and once again claimed victory.

With the competition over, the results of each heat have been reviewed to determine which faction received the most support over the course of the campaign. The final result indicates that the winner of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the EG Pilots.

The EG Pilots will now enter the Dangerous Games, competing with the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party for the right to join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful.

Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be a dramatic competition:

\Each faction has enjoyed its share of success, but ultimately there could be only one winner. The EG Pilots have proved they can attract considerable support, but does that mean they can go toe to toe with the likes of the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps and the Social Eleu Progressive Party? Only time will tell.\

\My thanks go to those who took the time to support this campaign. The data you have provided will now be analysed, and with luck it will tell us more about what happens to the many spacefarers who disappear every day, every week, every year. How many are abducted? How many run out of fuel, far from home? And how many simply disappear without explanation? Your data will help us answer these questions.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Terry Port in the Garoku system.


* Community Goal: The Battle of Daramo
The Daramo system is currently under Federal control, but recent reports indicate that both Imperial and independent forces \u2013 the latter under the rule of Pirate King Archon Delaine \u2013 are attempting to wrest power from the Federation.

The Federation is evidently not about to capitulate. In a statement, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy said:

\The Daramo system is of considerable strategic value to the Federation, and we will not surrender it without a fight. We have issued an emergency call to all Federation-aligned pilots \u2013 you are needed in Daramo!\

The Empire, predictably, has responded in kind. Captain Danvers of the Imperial Navy said:

\In the interest of the wellbeing of the citizens of Daramo, it is imperative that Imperial law be instated as soon as possible. If the Federation is allowed to retain control of the system, the people of Daramo will be sure to suffer.\

The Independents of Daramo have stepped in to coordinate operations on behalf of the Federation, while the Vaka Citizens of Tradition have been authorised to oversee the Imperial campaign. Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 23rd of June 3302.

\It is true that Federal vessels have exchanged fire with independent pilots, but these exchanges were not instigated by the Federation, and any claims to the contrary are false.\

Admiral Price was asked to respond to calls from Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group for a public inquiry into the Federal presence in Merope. He responded:

\The presence of Federal ships in Merope is entirely legitimate. If our ships are fired upon, they will respond in kind, but I can assure you that the Federation does not have a military agenda in Merope.\

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Gliese 58 Inc

Varangian Syndicate

Chontaiko Purple Central Prtnrs

Values Party of 16 Persei

LTT 1798 Incorporated

Parana United Commodities

Dedalo Corp. Interstellar

Independent Kongi League

League of Byeri First

Krivisci Partners

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

EG Union

Magn Allied Interstellar

Social Shotep Worker's Party

Narasimha Silver Raiders

Bureau of Ross 209

Green Party of Pataheimr

United 6 Andromedae Democrats

People's Blati Coalition

Pixel Bandits Security Force

Liberals of Wolf 871

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Freelance Report: Canonn at Full Tilt
Following a recent statement from Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy concerning Farragut Battle Cruisers in the Merope system, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has responded:

\Admiral Price's authoritative assurance is most welcome. Canonneers and other researchers can hereafter refer to his words as we learn more about the barnacles, and why the Unknown Artefacts point towards Merope.\

Dr Arcanonn also confirmed that barnacle sites had been located in the Witch Head Nebula, while Canonn vessels continue to search for barnacles in other nebulae.

Concluding his statement, Dr Arcanonn commented on the elusive Unknown Probes \u2013 believed to be related to Unknown Artefacts.

\We are now examining an Unknown Probe secured by my esteemed colleague Professor Monkey D Luffy. Early research indicates that it orients itself towards Merope 5 C, a site of barnacle proliferation. Obviously, Merope remains under intense scrutiny.\

Commander Nicholas Powell


* Galactic News: Federal Forces Triumphant
Following three days of conflict, the Independents of Daramo have confirmed that the Federation has successfully resisted the Imperial offensive in the Daramo system. In the wake of the victory, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy extended his gratitude to the many pilots who supported the Federation, and added:

\Hopefully this episode will remind our enemies that they cannot simply take whatever they want. It was not so long ago that the Empire was nothing more than a gaggle of clueless colonists on Achenar 6d, while the Federation controlled over a thousand systems. The Empire should remember where it came from.\

Territorial disputes between the Federation and the Empire are not uncommon, but the strength of Admiral Yorke's words, and in particular the use of \enemies\ will no doubt trigger considerable debate on the current state Federation-Empire relationship.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Federal Congress

Progressive Party of Abukunin

Natural LP 811-17 Conservatives

HIP 117865 Flag\t

Freedom Party of Walka

Hu Jona Natural Systems

Liberty Party of Han Xiang

Jera Social Democrats

HIP 116460 Patrons of Law

LTT 700 Front

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Lalande 18115 Natural Network\t

51 Aquilae Gold Creative Systems

Coringha Galactic Industry

Coastakal Co-op

Brani Federal Holdings

Gang of LHS 512

Epsilon Indi Party

Dominion of Sowiio

Jet Bridge Inc

Haritana Dynamic Group

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report
This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

HIP 43358 Central Corp

Shona Nationalists

Birpinovit Dynasty

Crimson General PLC

Ross 986 Progressive Party

Freedom Party of Ba Pin

People's V775 Herculi Revolutionary Party

Kremainn Blue Brotherhood

Brotherhood of Daiburi

Calarum Co-op

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest:

Revolutionary Zeta Aquilae Republic Party

Thrigpa Solutions

Ladabalbasa Silver Creative and Co

LHS 224 Blue Crew

Wolf 363 Blue Partnership

Nurundere Gold Mob

LFT 168 Electronics Limited

Sawahinn Nationalists

Aristocrats of Polochans\t

League of Harm First

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Galactic News: Jaques Station Found!
Two weeks ago it was reported that Jaques Station, the legendary travelling starport, had survived its attempt to jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point.

Unfortunately, however, the starport's location could not be verified due to problems with its communication systems. Fragmentary messages, picked up by a number of outposts, gave hints as to what had befallen the station, but the incomplete nature of the messages left recipients with no clear idea of where it might be.

But a recent report indicates that, despite all odds, the starport has been found. An independent pilot by the name of Commander Cly happened upon the station while exploring the Eol Prou AA-A H89 Nebula. The pilot has confirmed that Jaques is in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. Commander Cly also reported that the starport is still suffering from technical issues, presumably due to Unknown-Artefact related interference.

It is hoped that Jaques will make a statement soon.


* Galactic News: Jaques Speaks
Following news that Jaques Station has been found in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system, Jaques has broadcast a message to the media, having apparently restored communications at his starport:

\First, I'd like to thank all the pilots who came looking for me.\

\As for what happened, well...I guess it was a little ambitious to try to jump all the way to Beagle Point. As soon as I entered witch-space, it was clear something was up with the drive engines. And the navigation system. And the power distributor.\

\Pretty soon I realised I had a choice \u2013 push on to Beagle Point and arrive as a cloud of shrapnel, or drop into the nearest safe system. I made the only choice I could \u2013 to push on. Then I came to my senses and decided to drop into Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.\

Jaques was asked if he would be making another attempt to reach Beagle Point.

\I don't think Jaques Station will be jumping again anytime soon. The old girl wasn't really built for long-distance travel, and the last leap put a lot of strain on the superstructure. I think I'm going to be in Eol Prou whatever-it's-called for the foreseeable future. Still, the view here is lovely, so it could be worse.\

In related news, various members of the galactic community have begun collecting meta-alloys to repair Jaques Station, and will soon depart for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.


* Community Goal: The Rise to Power Begins
For much of the past month, the galactic community has been captivated by the Dangerous Games, a semi-official competition organised by some of the galaxy's largest factions to determine which wields the greatest degree of power and influence.

Three events have taken place so far, with pilots from across the galaxy fighting fervently to support their chosen group. With the 'Wildcard' stage of the competition over, it is time for the main event to begin.

Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, explained how the Rise to Power will work:

\There are six factions taking part: the EG Pilots, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Over the next three weeks, there will be a series of campaigns in which each faction will try to rally as much support as possible. The faction that dominates its rivals will join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful.\

The first Rise to Power event requires pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver them to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The faction that accumulates the most Gilya signature weapons will be declared the winner of the first heat.

The event begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week.


* Community Goal: Defending Graill Redd
Authorities in the Graill Redd system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. Apparently, organisations in neighbouring systems \u2013 the Citizen Party of G146-60 and the Workers Party of G 176-29 \u2013 are attempting to cultivate discord in the system in order to pave the way for the introduction of communism.

To counter this threat, the Graill Redd Liberals have placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Graill Redd system, and have promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to J. G. Ballard Gateway.

The campaign begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Starport Status Update

* Galactic News: Memorial to the Highliner Antares Unveiled
The Sirius Corporation has unveiled a memorial to those who lost their lives aboard the Highliner Antares, which was destroyed in 3251 during its maiden voyage. Using debris retrieved from the ship, capricious talent Delvin Hoorgan has created a striking tribute to the souls lost on the ship's inaugural flight.

The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a crescendo of brilliance before subsiding.

Delvin Hoorgan waived his usual commission to participate in the project. When he unveiled the memorial, he stated he was proud to have been involved in remembering the event.


* Freelance Report: Friendly Fire over Merope 2 A
Despite assertions from Admiral Maxton Price that Federal ships in Merope would not initiate conflict, a recent incident report tells a different story.

The report claims that a clearly marked Asp Explorer science vessel was shot down, without provocation, by Federal vessels above Merope 2 A. Rescue teams from Obsidian Orbital, responding to a distress call, found the smoking wreckage of the ship a short distance from a barnacle site guarded by a Farragut Battle Cruiser and a squadron of combat ships. The pilot \u2013 a captain in the Federal Auxiliary Navy \u2013 was only slightly injured.

A spokesperson for the Federal Auxiliary Navy said: \A lone Asp with retracted weapons is no threat to a battle group, and the Navy can't shoot whomever they want without jurisdiction. If one of my boys ignored the rules of engagement like that, I'd throw the book at them. Admiral Price can expect a formal inquiry from the JAG as soon as the paperwork is done.\

The Federation has not issued an official response.


* Galactic News: Empire Criticises Federal Presence in Merope
Over the past week, there has been considerable debate over the presence of Federal battle cruisers in the Merope system. The ships have taken up position near the non-human structures commonly known as barnacles, prompting censure from various sections of the galactic community.

A recent statement from Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy argued that the Federal presence in Merope was \entirely legitimate\. In response, Imperial Senator Zemina Torval has released a statement condemning what she says is an attempt to lay claim to the barnacles and, by extension, the meta-alloys.

\Meta-alloys are the only material capable of countering the disruptive effects of the Unknown Artefacts, and are therefore of singular value.\

\There is no doubt in my mind that the Federation's decision to deploy warships in Merope represents an attempt to claim possession of the barnacles and the meta-alloys they produce. This is unacceptable.\

Senator Torval refused to be drawn on what action, if any, the Empire would take in response to the Federal blockade. But given the recent conflict between the Federation and the Empire in the Daramo system, it seems likely that this development heralds further erosion of the Empire-Federation relationship.


* Freelance Report: The Jaques Rescue Mission
Recent reports indicate that a coalition of independent pilots has coordinated a mission to deliver meta-alloys to Jaques Station. A spokesperson for the group issued the following statement:

\We need your help, Commanders! Everyone's favourite cyborg barman, Jaques, has been discovered by Commander Cly in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system.\

\Pilots are gathering in Maia for what will be the longest single-stop trade run in galactic history. Their mission is to deliver meta-alloys to Jaques Station and repair the damage done by the Unknown Artefacts.\

\In the interests of speed and efficiency, many pilots are flying Asp Explorers. Outfitting options vary between 8 and 16 tonnes of cargo, and large fuel scoops are common among the intrepid rescue party.\

\The mission's first waypoint has been designated as Synuefai PI-I c26-8. Further systems along the route will be announced soon.\

Hyperion Allied Incorporated

Chick Bara Empire Party

Zeta Aquilae Blue Transport Org

LHS 2813 Democrats

Kipgeninka Empire League

Values Party of LTT 10462

Luhman 16 Central and Co

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Give and Take
Today marked Kumo Tribute Day, which sees representatives from systems under the control of Archon Delaine curry favour with the Pirate Lord by presenting him with lavish gifts.

Highlights included the presentation of several Imperial aristocrats, an assortment of rare narcotics and even a live barnacle. One system gifted a gold-plated Federal Corvette equipped with experimental weapons, much to the Pirate Lord's approval.

But several systems were unable to present anything of value, having fallen on difficult times. One unlucky official named Ferdinand Haim, representing the Lusonda system, arrived empty handed, pledging his system's undying loyalty as tribute. As silence descended, the Pirate Lord thanked Haim for his gift before ordering him to prove his loyalty by taking his own life.

As Haim's dead body was removed, one pirate joked: \There's always one who plays the loyalty card. Who do they think we are \u2013 the Empire?\

* Galactic News: Zachary Hudson Responds to Imperial Criticism
Yesterday, the Empire joined the debate over the Federation's decision to deploy Farragut Battle Cruisers in the Merope system. In a statement, Senator Zemina Torval asserted that the use of Federal warships represented an attempt to claim possession of the non-human structures, commonly known as barnacles, found in Merope.

Responding to this criticism, Federal President Zachary Hudson has released a statement to the media:

\Our motives are entirely altruistic. The Federal presence in the Pleiades is motivated solely by a desire to protect the non-human structures located there.\

\Since the barnacles were first discovered, they have been ruthlessly exploited. Given the barnacles' value to xenobiologists, and taking into consideration the possibility that they may possess some form of sentience, this exploitation cannot be allowed to continue.\


* Freelance Report: The Reclamation of Facece
After months of vicious fighting, the Imperial Naval Auxiliary has reinstated the Facece Empire Party as the controlling power of the Facece system.

Marquis Endincite, who coordinated the effort to reclaim the system, made the following statement to the Imperial Herald:

\The Empire Party has regained administration of Facece, and we beseech Imperial Commanders everywhere to ensure its continued dominance in the system. Never again should the Empire allow its pre-eminent Naval base to fall under the sway of disloyal elements.\

The Allied Facece Order, which seized Facece late last year, retains control of multiple planetary and orbital stations. Fighting is likely to continue for months.

Chancellor Anders Blaine, the system's administrator, has yet to make an official statement. But he is reportedly preparing to address the Empire, and to commend Marquis Endincite and the Imperial Naval Auxiliary for their service.

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Freelance Report: Debate over Federal Intervention Continues
As the debate rages over the presence of the Federal battle cruiser Thanatos at Merope 2 A, public opinion has reached a crescendo. Commanders throughout the galaxy are weighing in. Is the Federal presence warranted?

While some Commanders applaud the Federation for its efforts to conserve the barnacles, just as many condemn the action.

One pilot, who wishes to remain anonymous but who supports the Federation, said: \Whether or not you believe the barnacles are sentient, they're currently our only known source of meta-alloys. That in itself should warrant renewable harvesting techniques, rather than the vicious exploitation that has taken place so far.\

Others are just as adamant that everyone should be allowed to access the barnacles, and that the Federation has no right to place restrictions on valuable resources.

Another Commander said: \Typical Feds, sticking their nose into something that has nothing to do with them.\

* Community Goal: The Rise to Power Continues
The first stage of the Rise to Power campaign is over, and the second is about to begin.

This phase of the competition will focus on what has been euphemistically referred to as commodity reallocation, with pilots being asked to gather as many technical blueprints as they can for their chosen faction. The only condition is that the technical blueprints be obtained unlawfully...which is to say stolen. The group with the most technical blueprints at the end of the event will be declared the winner.

The Rise to Power competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.

The event begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week.


* Galactic News: Jaques Station on the Mend
Only a week after an independent mission was launched to bring aid to Jaques Station, personnel at the starport have reported that limited repairs have been completed. A member of the station's technical team confirmed that meta-alloys had been used to partially restore the starport's commodities market, and went on to say:

\We're hugely grateful to all the pilots who have so selflessly made the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. But we feel bad about not being able to reimburse those who schlepped out here, so we're trying to secure funds for a proper campaign to repair the starport. More details will follow soon.\

Meanwhile, reports have surfaced of an increasing number of independent pilots and civilian delegations departing for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, indicating a strong impulse to establish permanent bases in the region.


* Community Goal: Federal Expansion Campaign Begins
The Future of Segovan, a Federal organisation based in the Segovan system, has announced plans to construct a number of new Federal Naval outposts, starting in Segovan and reaching out into the Pleiades sector.

The bases will serve as resupply points for Federal vessels, and will support ongoing Federal operations in the region.

A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said:

\This is an ambitious initiative that will only succeed with the support of the galactic community. We are therefore calling on all Federation-aligned pilots to deliver insulating membrane, gallium and power generators to our base of operations at Ramsbottom Hub, so we can start work on the first outpost.\

The initiative begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Order Restored to Graill Redd
The Graill Redd Liberals have announced that their campaign to clear the Graill Redd system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the communists operating in the system.

Authorities in the Graill Redd system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at J. G. Ballard Gateway.


* Galactic News: EG Pilots Victorious
Last week saw the start of the Rise to Power competition, a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's largest factions wields the greatest degree of power and influence. The winner of the competition will be in a position to compete with the galaxy's major power players.

The first Rise to Power event required pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver it to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The week-long event saw plenty of conflict, with pilots doing everything in their power to disrupt their rivals' operations.

The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots are the winner of the first Rise to Power heat, having received the largest quantity of Gilya signature weapons. But whether the EG Pilots will claim ultimate victory remains to be seen.

* Freelance Report: Border Coalition Backs SEPP
In an emergency meeting at Iren's Dock on the 3rd of July 3302, the Border Coalition presented the Manite-Piscium-Pact to an assembly of interested parties. The outcome was a unanimous decision to back the Social Eleu Progressive Party in the Rise to Power campaign. The vote was swayed by a personal intervention from Duke Tiberius of Mikunn, who said:

\We believe in exploration, colonization and scientific discovery. These ideas are bigger than Mikunn or Manite, bigger than the Border Coalition, bigger even than the outer colonies. For this reason the Border Coalition will be backing the SEPP in its bid for power.\

The Border Coalition evidently hopes that the faction that triumphs in the Rise to Power share its belief in the value of peaceful exploration, colonization and scientific discovery \u2013 a view shared by a significant number of other influential factions.

A diplomatic summit is scheduled for Wednesday the 13th of July 3302 to discuss which options would be considered in the event of a GalCop victory, including a full backing of the EG Pilots.

* Freelance Report: Strategic Resource Denial
General Alexander Lee, recently retired from United Teaka First, made a guest appearance on the independent talk show Affairs of State this weekend. General Lee responded to questions regarding Federal fleets stationed at barnacle sites.

\Strategic resource acquisition and denial is key in any conflict. It is accomplished by taking resource-rich territory by force, by destroying one's own resources when in retreat, and various other means. The presence of Federation warships at barnacle sites follows this strategic behaviour.\

\It doesn't take a grand strategist to see what's happening. The Federation has secured a key strategic asset \u2013 the only resource known to counter damage inflicted by Unknown Artefacts. Even if the Federation doesn't intend to collect the meta-alloys, the Empire will be forced to respond by either securing alternative sites, or by contesting current Federation claims. In either case, Independent systems afflicted by UA malfunctions will continue to suffer.\

* Galactic News: Federal Citizens Call for Halsey's Release
A growing proportion of the Federation's population is clamouring for the release of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey, who is currently a patient at a secure psychiatric facility on Mars. Despite assertions from Halsey's personal staff that the former president entered the facility of her own volition, an increasingly large section of the galactic community apparently holds the view that she was hospitalised not for the good of her health, but in order to silence her.

One of those calling for Halsey's release said:

\It seems even former presidents aren't allowed to speak the truth. Jasmina Halsey is right \u2013 we should keep expanding, pushing out into space \u2013 but the Federal government isn't interested. And now they've had her imprisoned.\

There has been increased discussion on newsfeeds over the past week concerning the former Federal president, and crowds of people have begun congregating outside the Clearwater Clinic, protesting her confinement.

For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Federal Expansion Ignites Controversy
The announcement of Federal plans to expand into the Pleiades Nebula, and the Federation's call for the support of independent pilots, has ignited a firestorm of controversy. Although there is support for the Federation's goals, many have expressed reservations.

One Commander, who wished to remain anonymous due to his rank in the Federal Naval Reserve, clarified his concerns:

\The Federation has a history of concealment when it comes to discoveries suggesting the existence of non-human entities.\

\We don't know how long Federal scientists have been experimenting with the Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probes, but we do know they came to public awareness when they fell out of Federation vessels. We don't know much about the barnacles, but we know the Federation has set up perimeters around them.\

\I believe in the Federation,\ he continued, \but there is an element within it that wants to cover up important information about humanity's place in the galaxy. That information belongs to everyone. We must demand increased transparency and openness before allowing the Federation to assume greater influence.\

Commander Corlas


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Thakur Ltd

Maratians Co-op

People's Ququve Progressive Party

Allied Almudji Front

Hu Jini Patron's Principles

Hidar Federal Industries

Keiadir Company

Picoria Defence Party

Medusa Galactic Systems

Li Bestina Ltd

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Limapa Blue State Commodities

Koraik Dragons

United Teaka First

United Pendijin Focus

He Pola Empire Pact

Gebel Empire League

League of George Pantazis Defence Force

Social LFT 859 Green Party

Inhers Alliance

LHS 1380 Empire Assembly

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Freelance Report: Federal Expansion Brought to a Halt
The Federal expansion campaign has been brought to a complete standstill.

Ramsbottom Hub in the Segovan system has entered a state of lockdown, and many independent Commanders who had loaded up on commodities are now unable to complete their deliveries.

The Federation has yet to make an official announcement, but reports have been flooding in from the galactic community on possible causes for the lockdown. Some pilots claim they were attacked by Imperial vessels, while others maintain it was pirates.

Almost 4,000 pilots have contributed over 3.5 million tonnes between them. Now those Commanders are stuck with nowhere to deliver the requested commodities, and are understandably frustrated.

The Federation is receiving the brunt of the backlash. Some are saying that Federal expansion on this scale was always going to receive opposition from the Empire, while others maintain that the Federation should have prepared for this eventuality by offering multiple ports of delivery and better security.

One Commander said: \I'm here to protect the barnacles \u2013 I don't care about Feds or Imps. This is a prime example of politics getting in the way of what's truly important. They need to get off their high horses and discuss how we can protect the barnacles.\

* Galactic News: Federal Campaign Resumes
Four days ago, the Federation launched a campaign to construct a new Federal outpost in the Segovan system. Federally aligned pilots were invited to contribute construction materials to the campaign, but the request proved controversial, with various sections of the galactic community asking why the Federation was expanding towards the Pleiades sector.

Not long after the campaign began, Imperial pilots began targeting traders delivering cargo to the Ramsbottom Hub starport. As the situation escalated, system authorities imposed a system-wide lockdown in an attempt to maintain order. Ramsbottom Hub was closed, and pilots wanting to deliver materials were left with no way of contributing to the campaign. Authorities insisted that the lockdown was intended to keep the system's inhabitants safe, but Federal pilots were understandably frustrated.

Recent reports from Segovan indicate that the Federation has now despatched a deputation to the system \u2013 including two Farragut-class Battlecruisers \u2013 and convinced system authorities to lift the lockdown. A Federal spokesperson said:

\The lockdown had a negative impact on our campaign, certainly, but the huge quantity of material delivered to Ramsbottom Hub prior to the lockdown means we are still confident we can meet our baseline targets.\

\With the lockdown now removed, we would like to renew our plea to Federally aligned pilots to support this vitally important initiative.\


* Freelance Report: Taskforce Athena Locks Down Segovan
In a move likely to further inflame relations between the superpowers, a coalition of Empire-aligned Commanders has declared the Segovan system a no-fly zone. Ramsbottom Hub, the site of an ongoing Federation construction project, has been placed in security lockdown, and traders have been advised that services are currently unavailable.

Commander Kyrthak, a spokesman for Taskforce Athena, the coalition imposing the no-fly zone, made the following statement:

\The actions of the Future of Segovan represent an unbridled attempt to project force into the Pleiades and further exploit the region's Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys. Taskforce Athena is actively combating Federal security services in order to halt construction of these new Federal outposts. If the Federation continues down this path, it will cost them dearly.\

The Federation has placed heavy bounties on the offending Commanders.

* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Natural BV Phoenicis Front

Manbatz Future

Yemakinni Organisation

Tapirape Silver Energy Systems

BD+14 2955 Republic Party

Values Party of Priva

Wonorne Nu Natural Limited

United LTT 12990 Movement

Ross 597 Advanced Group

LHS 1547 Commodities

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Lave Fortune Organisation

Kraurno Blue Brothers

Belenses Services

Dimor and Co

Tewinicnii Vision Corporation

Baraswar Crimson Vision Ltd

Tsu Purple Power Interstellar

Kamadhenu Netcoms Corporation

Liberty Party of Lodhary

People's Tun for Equality

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report
This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown:

Future of Segovan

Convoumia Nationals

LTT 1353 Life Industry

Movement for Uzumeru Partnership

Karnarki League\t

LHS 2157 Future

Yen Camus Labour

Clan of Chacobog

LHS 21 Fortune Ltd

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period.

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest:

Bhajaja Crimson General Ind

Shona Inc

United LFT 1300 Progressive Party

Natural Ross 671 Movement

Mehet Partnership

LFT 37 Purple Comms Corp.

Tialocan Organisation

Integrated Nemgla

Wolf 359 Conservatives

Warnates Free

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.


* Galactic News: Imperial Ships to Enter Merope
Following a recent statement from Senator Zemina Torval in which the seasoned politician criticised the deployment of Federal battlecruisers in the Merope system, Admiral Denton Patreus has entered the debate. At a hastily organised press conference on Capitol, Admiral Patreus addressed the Federal intervention:

\Like Senator Torval, I believe that the Federal presence in Merope represents an attempt to lay claim to the system's non-human structures. This will not stand. An Imperial deputation will therefore be mobilised and despatched to the Merope system. I will take personal command of the fleet, which will depart within the month.\

Patreus did not clarify whether the Imperial ships would engage the Federal fleet, or simply establish a counter-blockade. But one thing is for sure: this development can only serve to heighten tensions between the Federation and the Empire.


* Galactic News: Federal Campaign Derailed Again
Reports coming in from the Segovan system indicate that the Federation's campaign to construct an outpost in the system has once again been disrupted. Starport personnel have confirmed that the station is experiencing a wide range of technical problems as a result of Unknown Artefact-related interference.

You almost have to admire those Imperial pilots,\ said one member of starport personnel. \I mean, it's a pain in the ass for us \u2013 we've got malfunctions and power outages popping up all over the place \u2013 but you've got to respect their determination. First they tried targeting the traders. Then they hit the station with Unknown Artefacts.\

Starport authorities were unable to confirm when services at the station would be restored. Meanwhile, Federal President Zachary Hudson issued a statement:

\The individuals responsible for this cowardly attack clearly care nothing for the people of Ramsbottom Hub, whose lives have been severely disrupted. These people are terrorists, pure and simple.\

\I want to assure the people of Ramsbottom Hub, and all Federal citizens, that we will find the individuals responsible, and we will make them pay.\


* Galactic News: Federal Campaign Concludes
The Future of Segovan has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion, despite repeated attempts from Imperial pilots to disrupt the campaign. Large quantities of gallium and insulating membrane, and hundreds of tonnes of power generators, were delivered to Ramsbottom Hub, the organisation's base of operations, allowing work to begin on the first of a series of new Federal outposts.

A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said:

\The Federation's opponents went to great lengths to try to stop this operation, but ultimately they failed. The construction of this outpost will proceed as planned.\


* Community Goal: Searching for Barnacles
Since the non-human structures known as barnacles were first discovered, they have prompted fierce debate, attracted intense scrutiny and even triggered the despatch of a Federal Fleet to the Merope system.

As the only known source of meta-alloys, the barnacles are of considerable value. It is therefore unsurprising that the Empire has issued an appeal for exploration data in the hope of finding more. A spokesperson for Bava Blue Travel Systems, which is coordinating the campaign, made the following statement:

\The barnacles are of central importance, and it is vital that we determine whether or not there are any more out there. We are therefore launching an appeal for exploration data, to begin at once, as part of a search for further barnacles.\

The spokesperson was asked if the campaign had been prompted by the Federation's decision to station battle cruisers at barnacle sites in the Merope system, but she declined to comment.

Bava Blue Travel Systems, on behalf of the Empire, has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Bauschinger City in the Bava system. The campaign begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: EG Pilots win Second Rise to Power Event
The second heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this event, pilots were asked to head to the Nervi system and gather technical blueprints for their chosen faction. The one condition imposed on the pilots was that the technical blueprints must be stolen \u2013 a stipulation that gave rise to a number of clashes with Nervi security forces.

The final tally indicates that the largest quantity of technical blueprints was received by the EG Pilots, making them the winner of this stage of the campaign. But whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Rise to Power competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign.

The Rise to Power competition will run for one more week, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.


* Community Goal: The Rise to Power Concludes
The third and final stage of the Rise to Power campaign is about to begin.

For this heat, pilots have been asked to salvage precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. But the event organisers have chosen to complicate matters by refusing to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site. Pilots participating in the event have been given just one clue to its location - the following signal:

353133313639313835 3432313232313132 31393235313932303531333139 A6B1D4H1I4K1L1M2N1O2R1U1V1Y1Z1 3132313533313132 373131323134353230 32353133313531343139

The group that manages to accumulate the most precious gems will be declared the winner of the final Rise to Power event. At the close of the event, the results of each heat will be reviewed. The faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.

The event begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run for one week.

* Galactic News: The Origin of the Alliance
In a return to our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the foundation of the Alliance.

\The Alliance may champion the ideals of harmony and independence, but it is very much the product of violence.\

\Alioth, the Alliance powerbase, was once a highly contested system. In the decades that followed its colonisation, it was the site of almost constant conflict between the Federation and the Empire. Naturally this made life difficult for the system's inhabitants, whose lives were impacted by generation after generation of war.\

\The turning point came in 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying one of Alioth's main population centres attempted to raise prices. This triggered a revolt. Federal and Imperial forces were despatched to quell the uprising, but the resistance, bolstered by fighters from neighbouring independent systems, successfully repelled them. Ultimately the Empire chose to withdraw from the system, reluctant to commit to a potentially protracted campaign far from its centre of power. When the Federation realised how unpopular the war had become among Federal citizens, it followed suit.\

\In the wake of the conflict, the idea of an independent socio-political body rapidly gained popularity among the people of Alioth, and in 3230 the Alliance of Independent Systems was established. Its founding principles were simple: to protect and support those who wanted to remain independent of the Federation and the Empire, and to empower its member systems while simultaneously preserving their independence. Over the next two decades, more than twenty systems joined the Alliance.\

\Today, the Alliance is widely seen as a paragon of democracy in an increasingly autocratic galaxy. It is governed by a body known as the Alliance Assembly, the primary function of which is to establish common policies and treaties among the Alliance's member systems, and act as an arbitration body when necessary. The notional head of the Assembly is the prime minister, but in reality it is the Council of Admirals that wields the greatest degree of power.\

\The Council of Admirals is a six-person body comprising the leaders of the six largest military forces in the Alliance. In addition to selecting the prime minister, the Council also commands the Alliance Defence Force, a vast flotilla of ships contributed by each of the Alliance's member systems. The Council of Admirals is free to deploy the Defence Force without the approval of the Assembly, making it extremely powerful.\

\There can be no argument that the Alliance lacks the power-projection abilities of the Empire and the Federation. But it is more than capable of competing with them in economic and political terms, and of defending its member systems when necessary.\

\What the future holds remains to be seen, but under the strong leadership of Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, it seems likely the Alliance will only continue to grow.\


* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey Discharged
It has been two months since former Federal president Jasmina Halsey was admitted to the Clearwater Clinic psychiatric facility on Mars. Halsey's admission followed a period of bizarre behaviour, during which she claimed to have encountered super-intelligent beings in the depths of space.

Since then, a proportion of the Federal population has been calling for the former president's release, claiming that she was hospitalised not for the good of her health but in order to silence her. This suggestion was dismissed as \patently ridiculous\ by Halsey's personal staff, but this did little to deter those campaigning for Halsey's freedom.

Now it seems the campaigners have got their wish. Today, Jasmina Halsey left the Clearwater Clinic of her own volition, having been deemed ready to return to society by her doctors.

President Halsey was met at the entrance of the clinic by a crowd of supporters, to whom she gave a brief statement:

\I would like to thank the staff of this fine institution for helping me during this troubled time. It's fair to say I haven't quite been myself recently, and I apologise wholeheartedly for any distress I might have caused.\


* Freelance Report: The Silent Arbiter
As Utopia completes its mission in the Maia system, senior Utopian figures have voiced alarm at the deteriorating situation between the Federation and the Empire over the barnacles. One member of the commune said:

\We are surrounded by a galactic mystery. Recent events indicate that humanity may not be alone in the universe.\

\Some believe we are being stalked by monsters. Others think we will soon encounter a higher intelligence. We must be optimistic, and meet the future \u2013 whatever it may hold \u2013 with a collective voice.\

\I believe humanity is being watched, its actions noted. Soon, we will be judged. Our survival depends on the decisions we make right now. We must not, and cannot, fight among ourselves.\

* Freelance Report: The Demands of Supply
\Commanders are advised to search within nebulae for rocky or high-metal content worlds with a composition of between 66.5% and 99.1% rock and 8.9% and 33.5% metal, with 0% ice. Temperatures between 194K and 451K should be sought. To narrow the field, Commanders should also seek bodies with gravity between 0.06g and 0.3g.\

This text is taken from 'Barnacle Search Criteria', a recent publication from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group.

Commentators are divided on what impact, if any, this information will have on the increasingly volatile situation in and around the Merope system. But many agree that if the barnacles are being viewed as a finite resource, the Canonn's data may serve to defuse tensions, at least temporarily.

The publication of the criteria is believed to have followed a private conference between Dr Arcanonn and Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute. Dr Arcanonn commented:

\We must not let the drums of war drown out the fact that the stated positions of the Federation and the Empire are, upon review, far from irreconcilable.\

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Jacques Barnacle Search
The discovery of Jacques Station has prompted many Commanders to load up on meta-alloys and start the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.

One group that has already made it has begun searching the area for barnacles. If the structures are found, they could provide Jacques with the meta-alloys needed to fix the station.

Some Commanders remain sceptical, arguing that the barnacles are engineered and won't be found in the system, but that hasn't stopped the search from going ahead. For many it is not a question of 'if' barnacles will found it \u2013 it is a question of 'when'. One of the searchers said:

\It makes sense there would be barnacles out here \u2013 the system has many of the conditions required. But searching for them is a big job. Any assistance from pilots in the area is welcome.\

* Freelance Report: Meta-Alloy Rush
As the Federation and Empire attempt to lay claim to the organic structures known as barnacles, the demand for meta-alloys has skyrocketed. Many starports have begun placing orders for the material as a hedge against potential malfunctions.

Vernon Trask, lead engineer at Bauschinger City, said: \Some stations have been defunct for nearly a year because of those corrosive Artefacts. We can't afford to be out of commission that long.\

\Quite a few stations in the Empire have open orders for meta-alloys, including Bauschinger. We're hoping to get ahead of this techno-plague before it bites us.\

This 'meta-alloy rush' has alarmed conservationists and researchers concerned about the future of the barnacles.

\We know so little about the barnacles,\ said Dr Elana Lorax, a noted xenobiologist. \We don't know how they grow, how long they live or how they create meta-alloys. If the exploitation continues at this rate, we may never know.\

* Galactic News: Unknown Probe Breakthrough
The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has announced that one of its scientists has made a discovery regarding the so-called Unknown Probes.

According to a statement, a pilot by the name of Commander Rizal72 has confirmed that when the mysterious objects are examined with an advanced discovery scanner, they emit an electro-magnetic pulse that temporarily incapacitates the scanning ship. The pulse is followed by a brief burst of sound, similar in nature to the 'chittering' produced by the Unknown Artefacts.

Following this announcement, Commander Rizal72's colleagues at the Canonn Interstellar Research Group began subjecting recordings of the sound to various tests. They soon discovered that the sound contained an encrypted image, which some have interpreted as a depiction of interstellar bodies.

The meaning of the image, and the origin and purpose of the Probes, remains unclear. Clearly, there remains much to discover.

* Freelance Report: Barnacles under Assault
The recent meta-alloy rush has left many of the barnacles in the Pleiades Nebula barren.

As many scramble to meet the high demand for the material, it seems the Federation lacks the resources to provide adequate defence.

Federal vessels have reportedly transported huge quantities of meta-alloys from the Merope system, suggesting that it may be partly responsible for the drought.

One independent researcher said:

\As far as we know, a barnacle will 'regenerate' after one week, although we don't know if this is always the case.\

\Research indicates that harvesting only 'ripe' spikes will keep the barnacle healthy. A simple scan and visual check will confirm spike maturity.\

\Further testing will be needed to determine the specifics, but with the crisis facing civilised space, conducting controlled experiments on barnacles has become next to impossible.\

\The way things are going, we risk losing these magnificent entities for good.\

* Community Goal: A Majestic Development
Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage system, has launched a campaign to add three new Majestic-class Interdictors to the Imperial fleet.

At a press conference, Lucius Lavigny confirmed that the Emperor had personally authorised the campaign. According to Lavigny, the initiative is a direct response to the Federation's \ongoing military build-up\. The admiral closed the conference with the words: \We must continue to strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons.\

Lavigny's Legion has placed an open order for thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested material to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Restoring Order in Carthage
Authorities in the Carthage system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. To ensure these agitators do not disrupt the Lavigny's Legion campaign, a kill order has been placed on all wanted ships operating in the system. Lavigny's Legion has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Marker Depot.

The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: EG Pliots win Rise to Power
The third and final heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over.

For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to recover salvaged precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. Matters were complicated by the fact that the event organisers refused to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site, giving just a single clue to its location.

Once the location was found, a desperate race began as pilots urgently ferried the gems to the Laura Elizabeth starport in support of their chosen faction. Ultimately, it was the EG Pilots who received the most salvaged precious gems and claimed victory. But the celebrations were short-lived, as the EG Pilots waited tensely for the announcement of the overall victor.

Now that the results of each heat have been reviewed, the event organisers have announced that the winner of the Rise to Power campaign is...the EG Pilots.

Trinity Avon, reporting for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be an exciting competition:

\The EG Pilots have shown that they has the necessary strength and influence to be recognised as a power in their own right. I for one look forward to seeing what the future holds.\


* Galactic News: Imperial Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for Bava Blue Travel Systems has announced that hundreds of independent pilots responded to the recent Imperial appeal for exploration data, delivering large quantities of astronomical information to Bauschinger City in the Bava system. The appeal was part of an Imperial campaign to locate further barnacles, the only known source of meta-alloys.

In a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked the many Commanders who supported the campaign:

\We are immensely grateful to all the intrepid explorers who contributed to this initiative. Your data will now be analysed to see if it can reveal the location of further barnacle sites. Of course, this process is not an exact science, so it may take some time. We will keep the galactic community abreast of our progress.\


* Community Goal: Repair Jaques Station
Jaques, the owner and operator of Jaques Station, has issued an appeal for commodities to repair his beleaguered starport.

The station has been in poor shape ever since Jaques made an unsuccessful attempt to travel to Beagle Point. Since then, a number of independent pilots have voluntarily delivered meta-alloys to the station, resulting in the reopening of the starport's commodities market. But to restore the starport to full functionality, a full-scale campaign is needed. In a statement, Jaques said:

\We're very grateful to all the pilots who brought us meta-alloys over the past few weeks. But to get the station back online, we're also going to need power generators, tantalum, structural regulators and energy grid assemblies. So we're asking all pilots to deliver whatever they can.\

Jaques has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested materials to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for four weeks. If Jaques's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Freelance Report: Probe Research Implications
Recent developments in Unknown Probe research have raised concerns among military strategists.

Today, Captain Alexis Corvus of Task Force Athena briefed the Imperial Senate on the implications of an offensively deployed Unknown Probe.

\The offensive potential of these Probes mustn't be underestimated. A single fighter with a discovery scanner and a probe in its cargo hold could potentially disable dozens of spacecraft. A customized torpedo designed to similarly trigger its payload could be even more disruptive, allowing a hostile fleet to prey on the disabled vessels.\

\The zeal with which the Federation has been collecting resources like these probes leads me to believe they have already considered these use cases. Moreover, the stationing of no fewer than five Farragut-class Battlecruisers in Merope suggests this matter is of grave importance to them. If we mean to maintain the status quo, we must act prudently.\

* Freelance Report: A Year of Buckyball Racing
The Buckyball Racing Club was formed, one year ago, to provide a schedule of races involving a wide variety of pilots. In its first year the club hosted a total of 28 races, and to celebrate it is hosting one of its craziest yet: the BuckyBubble!

Commemorating the club's most famous race, the A* Challenge, the BuckyBubble starts at Lomas Station in the Wolf 359 system. Racers will navigate a route that passes through 60 systems loosely resembling the shape of a buckyball molecule.

Pilots are invited to join the chaos from the 23rd of July to the 7th of August.

* Galactic News: Knives Drawn
With the Federal-Imperial relationship currently on unsteady ground, political commentators have been reviewing recent events and offering their analyses of the current situation.

Most agree that the turning point came in March, when the Federation began construction of a new Farragut-class Battlecruiser in the Beta Hydri system. The Empire made no response to the development at first, but an anonymous Imperial source was quoted as saying: \If the Federation embarked on a campaign of military fortification, it's likely the Empire would respond in kind.\ A short time later, the Empire started work on a new Majestic-class Interdictor.

Conflict erupted in June, when Imperial forces attempted to take possession of the Federation-controlled Daramo system. The Federation was able to rebuff the offensive in just three days, however, prompting one high-ranking Federal officer to comment: \Hopefully this episode will remind our enemies that they cannot simply take whatever they want.\

A few weeks later, the Federation deployed a number of Farragut-class Battlecruisers to the Merope system. The ships took up position near the non-human structures commonly known as barnacles, prompting outrage from various sections of the galactic community. The Federation insisted its intention was to protect the sites, but the Empire remained unconvinced, accusing the Federation of trying to take possession of the barnacles. Shortly thereafter, the Empire announced that it too would despatch a deputation to Merope.

Commentators generally agree that the meta-alloys have now become a focus for Federal-Imperial antagonism. While it has been confirmed that the meta-alloys can counter the harmful effects of the Unknown Artefacts, no other applications for the material have been found. But speculation abounds that there may be as-yet undiscovered uses for the remarkable substance. The fact that the Federation has announced plans to construct a number of outposts in the Pleiades sector \u2013 one of the primary locations of meta-alloys \u2013 is further evidence that it has a keen interest in the material.

As tensions between the two superpowers increase, only one thing can be stated with certainty: in the competition for control of the meta-alloys, the Federation has taken the lead.


* Freelance Report: Could Halsey Shake up Federal Politics?
Following the release of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey from the Clearwater Clinic, commentators from around the galaxy are asking the same question: What's next for Halsey?

According to political analyst Emilio Blythe: \If Halsey were to return to politics, it could spell trouble for Shadow President Felicia Winters. Winters's leadership of the Liberal Party has been questioned over the last few months, and Halsey could conceivably retake control of the party.\

Meanwhile, members of the religious cult known as The Hands of the Architects are holding onto the hope that Halsey will take on the mantle of prophet, and lead them to 'communion with the Architects'.

Attempts to contact the former president have been rebuffed by her staff.

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: GalCop Mobilizes to Aid Jaques Station
Since contact with Jaques Station was re-established, a substantial effort from independent pilots to deliver meta-alloys to the stricken starport has returned it to partial functionality.

With the commodities market now open, Jaques has issued an appeal for the components needed to restore his station to full operational status. The Galactic Cooperative of Worlds has pledged to ensure the success of the initiative, having secured a logistical supply chain and established an operational beachhead in the surrounding sectors.

Jahena Yar Savor, GalCop's Chief Executive Officer, said that the Cooperative would \establish a localised resource base in the systems surrounding Jaques in order to offset the financial burden of securing these resources. Many of our pilots and member organisations acquired substantial wealth during the Dangerous Games, and we thought it would only be fair to use these assets to aid a friend.\

* Freelance Report: The August Exodus
With the possibility of war between the Federation and the Empire looming, a number of intrepid explorers have banded together to establish a new way of life among the stars. Over 300 pilots from across inhabited space have signed up to take part in the largest convoy ever assembled, designated the August Exodus \u2013 A Jaunt to Jaques.

The first convoy, comprising 250 pilots, set off from the Ocshooit system on the 24th of July, and is expected to reach Jaques Station within two weeks. The second convoy is being assembled, and almost 60 pilots have signed up so far. It will depart on the 15th of August.

It is hoped that this monumental effort will not only return Jaques Station to full operational power, but also usher in the birth of a new colony in the Colonia Nebula, where Jaques is currently located.

* Galactic News: Latest Imperial Campaign Concludes
Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage system, has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by delivering thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The organisation is now in a position to proceed with its campaign to construct three new Majestic-class Interdictors.


* Community Goal: New Federal Outpost
Three weeks ago, the Federation ignited controversy with its decision to establish a series of outposts in the Pleiades sector. The development triggered a decisive response from Empire-aligned pilots, who made repeated attempts to destabilise the campaign. Ultimately, the Federation was able to complete the operation, but the Federation's opponents had made their feelings clear \u2013 the superpower's military expansion would not proceed unopposed.

Now the Federation has announced plans to establish a new planetary outpost in the HIP 17225 system, which it claims will serve as \a trade and resource-processing hub\. Those familiar with HIP 17225 A 1 will be all too aware that the planet is home to a number of barnacle sites.

The Federation has placed an open order for tantalum, building fabricators and energy grid assemblies with which to construct the new base, and has authorised the Future of Segovan to reimburse pilots who deliver these materials to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Federation's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Establishing a Base in Eol Prou
The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has launched a campaign to establish a planetary outpost in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. According to the organisation's spokesperson, the primary purpose of the new outpost will be to support independent trade and exploration in the region.

In a statement, the spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

\Well, the arrival of Jaques triggered a real surge in interest in Eol Prou. And since the system is pretty remote, there's a clear need for an outpost to support pilots ferrying material to and from the starport. That's in the short term. There's also a desire among the galactic community to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou, so hopefully this campaign will be the start of something bigger.\

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has placed an open order for mined osmium for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver materials to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for four weeks.


* Community Goal: Empire Appeals for Meta-Alloys
As the galaxy becomes increasingly focused on the meta-alloys, the Empire has issued a galaxy-wide request for the controversial material. A spokesperson for the Zagoro Imperial Society, which is coordinating the appeal, released the following statement:

\We don't yet know all the applications of the meta-alloys, but their ability to counter the harmful effects of the Unknown Artefacts indicates a potentially significant relationship between them, the Artefacts and, presumably, the unknown probes. It would therefore be unwise to let anyone to establish a monopoly on this material.\

\By supporting this initiative, you can help ensure that humankind is ideally positioned to meet the future \u2013 whatever it may hold.\

It is presumably not immaterial that the Empire's initiative coincides with a Federal campaign to establish a new outpost on the planet HIP 17225 A 1 \u2013 a known barnacle site.

The Zagoro Imperial Society has promised to reward pilots who deliver meta-alloys to Axon Station in the Zagoro system. The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey Returns to Public Life
At a recent charity event, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey made her first public appearance since she was discharged from a secure psychiatric facility on Mars two weeks ago. The woman seen at the event differed dramatically from the frail individual seen leaving the Clearwater Clinic. Some commented that she appeared even more confident than when she was in office.

After the event, reporters asked President Halsey what she has planned for the future.

\I know that many of you have been perplexed by my recent statements, but having reflected on my experiences, I have accepted that what I saw might not have been literally real. I do believe, however, that the message contained in those experiences is valid, and that I have a duty to share that message.\

\As a species we have learned nothing from our history. We plundered the Earth for its treasures, treating it with callous indifference, and now we stumble blindly into space in pursuit of wealth and glory. And all the while we are heedless of the damage we cause.\

\We remain a violent species, unable to cooperate, and we are therefore deprived of the prosperity that true peace would bring.\

Halsey further surprised reporters by stating that she had recently met with Alliance Prime Minster Edmund Mahon, and that she would soon be relocating to a system within Alliance space.


* Galactic News: The Origin of the Pilots Federation
Continuing our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the foundation of the Pilots Federation.

\The Pilots Federation was established in 2805 in response to a surge in private-starship ownership. It was created principally to allow pilots to share reliable trade-route information, and to provide them with a system of mutual protection against the rising scourge of interstellar piracy.\

\At the time, independent pilots were generally mistrusted, the itinerant nature of their profession giving rise to perceptions of irresponsibility. The Pilots Federation's strict code of conduct put an end to this, and over time a galaxy-wide respect for its members emerged.\

\As piracy became more prevalent, the Pilots Federation started issuing bounties on known pirate vessels. Some of those outside the organisation condemned the initiative as bloodthirsty, but few were able to argue with the impact it had on piracy. Shortly thereafter, the Pilots Federation introduced an official ranking system to reflect the number of combat victories achieved by each of its members. Pilots who accumulated the largest number of kills were awarded the title of Elite \u2013 a citation that became highly coveted among independent pilots.\

\The Pilots Federation derives the bulk of its wealth from the GalNet data network. Originally a system of ship, bounty and star-chart data, it evolved into an interstellar aggregator of market information and galactic news. By 3300, the Pilots Federation was not only the dominant provider of this information, it was also the main manufacturer of the hardware and software serving this data. Today, Pilots Federation systems are fitted as standard on virtually all independent starships.\

\In 3290 the Pilots Federation expanded its ranking system to encompass the fields of trade and exploration. In 3301 it expanded it again to include pilots who had distinguished themselves in the Close Quarters Combat championships.\

\The Pilots Federation has always remained politically neutral, avowing that it exists to support pilots rather than nationalities or political factions. The organisation is based in the Shinrarta Dezhra system, which can be accessed only by invitation. Receiving an invitation is typically dependent on achieving a high rank in the Pilots Federation. This stipulation has contributed to perceptions of the organisation as secretive \u2013 a perception compounded by the fact that the Pilots Federation has very little direct interaction with the public.\

* Galactic News: Edmund Mahon Condemns Imperial-Federal Sabre Rattling
Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has offered a critical appraisal of the ongoing antagonism between the Empire and the Federation. His comments, delivering during a recent ministerial address, concern the conflict over the organic structures known as barnacles, and the meta-alloys they produce.

The pertinent part of his address is reprinted below:

\Our history contains no shortage of bloodshed. Territory, resources \u2013 we have gone to war over these things far too often.\

\We have expanded into the cosmos, made a home among the stars, created a civilisation spanning thousands of light years. Have we left our pettiness and greed behind, or have we brought them with us? I believe we are capable of working together to create a truly unified society. But the Empire and the Federation do not appear to share this view.\

\I implore my friends in the Empire and the Federation to look beyond their immediate concerns and consider the ramifications of their actions. The organic structures may well be the product of a non-human civilisation. They, and the meta-alloys, should be afforded our protection.\

\We could be on the brink of a new era of discovery. This is no time for military posturing.\

* Galactic News: Jaques Station Making a Comeback
It has been two weeks since Jaques, the owner and operator of Jaques Station, issued an appeal for commodities to repair his beleaguered starport. Since then, scores of pilots from across the galaxy have made the long journey to the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system to deliver tantalum, power generators and other materials to Jaques.

Although the campaign is scheduled to run for two more weeks, Jaques has confirmed that the materials received so far have allowed starport personnel to restore some of the station's facilities.

\The moment supplies started arriving our teams were hard at work, making repairs and restoring facilities. So I'm very pleased to announce that we can now offer our guests refuelling, restocking, repair and outfitting services, as well as the option to purchase limpets and mining equipment from our commodities market.\

\But we're not out of the woods yet! We still need more material if we're going to give the old girl a clean bill of health.\


* Community Goal: Boosting the Federal Fleet
As the antagonism between the Federation and the Empire continues to simmer, the Federation has announced plans to expand its Navy with three new Farragut-class Battlecruisers. The development follows a recent initiative to add three new capital ships to the Imperial fleet.

In a statement, Federal President Zachary Hudson spoke candidly about the motivation behind the campaign.

\We live in uncertain times, and we are on the brink of an uncertain future. When I speak to the people of the Federation, I want to be able to promise them that their homes and families are safe. By contributing to this campaign, you can help me keep that promise.\

The Federation has placed an open order for autofabricators, tantalum and superconductors for use in the construction, and has authorised the Workers of Gooheimar Alliance to reward pilots who deliver the requested materials to Brady Horizons in the Gooheimar system.

The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the Federation's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Federal Campaign Comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan has announced that the Federation's appeal for construction materials has come to an end. Thousands of tonnes of material were delivered to Obsidian Orbital this week, which will be used to construct a new outpost on HIP 17225 A 1. In a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked those who had contributed to the initiative:

\The Federal pilots who supported this campaign have performed a great service. The new outpost will provide the Federation with a valuable trade and resource-processing hub. You have made the Federation proud.\

The campaign attracted no small measure of controversy, however, with the Federation's opponents claiming that it represented a further attempt to control access to the non-human structures known as barnacles, a number of which are located on HIP 17225 A 1. One Imperial pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity, made the following statement to the Imperial Herald:

\The Federation wants to control the flow of meta-alloys, pure and simple. That's why they entered Merope, and that's why they're building this new outpost. And as for their claim that they're protecting the barnacles...well, does anyone really believe that anymore?\


* Galactic News: Imperial Appeal Comes to an End
The Empire's recent request for meta-alloys has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, which has delivered large quantities of the rare material to Axon Station in the Zagoro system. A spokesperson for the Zagoro Imperial Society, which coordinated the appeal, confirmed that hundreds of Imperial-aligned pilots had contributed to the campaign. In a statement, the spokesperson said:

\The Empire sincerely thanks you for your service, but this is merely the first step in ensuring that the Federal monopoly on this material does not continue unopposed. We cannot rest yet.\


* Community Goal: Ambika in Need
Authorities in the Ambika system have reported that the region is in the grip of a severe famine. All efforts to shore up agricultural markets have failed, and the food shortage has even triggered bouts of civil unrest. A tentative relief effort has begun, but the convoys attempting to bring aid to the people of Ambika are being targeted by opportunist pirates.

In response to this development, the Union Party of Ambika has launched a two-pronged initiative, focused on bringing relief to the people of Ambika and neutralising the agitators operating in the system. The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver the foods to Goulart City, and has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Ambika.

The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Freelance Report: Children of Liberty Criticize Mahon
The organization known as the Children of Liberty has issued a statement criticizing Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon for his recent remarks concerning the supposed failings of the Federation and Empire.

\Prime Minister Mahon has denounced the 'pettiness and greed' of his political rivals, but he tolerates those same sins among many of the Alliance's own member systems. He wishes to create 'a truly unified society', yet he tolerates ideologies within the Alliance's own borders that are irreconcilably opposed to one another! According to a study published in 3301, over 213 million Alliance citizens live under the rule of explicitly authoritarian governments. How can a galactic power that purports to value harmony and self-determination allow a member system to oppress its own citizens?\

The missive, though critical, does conclude on a note of accord:

\Despite our political disagreements, we believe Prime Minister Mahon is absolutely right to call for protection of the barnacles. The rampant exploitation of these structures is not only reckless, it may even be dangerous. Until we know more about their origin and purpose, we should treat the barnacles with respect...and a healthy dose of caution.\

* Community Goal: Ambika in Need
Authorities in the Ambika system have reported that the region is in the grip of a severe famine. All efforts to shore up agricultural markets have failed, and the food shortage has even triggered bouts of civil unrest. A tentative relief effort has begun, but the convoys attempting to bring aid to the people of Ambika are being targeted by opportunist pirates.

In response to this development, the Union Party of Ambika has launched a two-pronged initiative, focused on bringing relief to the people of Ambika and neutralising the agitators operating in the system. The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver food to Goulart City, and has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Ambika.

The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Freelance Report: Fuel Rats Announce Plans for New Outpost
Earlier today, the Fuel Rats Mischief announced plans for an extraction outpost near Jaques Station.

\We've been considering such a base for quite a while now. Originally the idea was to set up near Sagittarius A* since it's one of the regions most visited by explorers. The biggest challenge was always supplying the station with commodities like food and spare parts. Being near Jaques Station will solve this problem since it's equipped with a habitation ring, and because it's a destination for a steady stream of supply ships.\

Asked if the fact that Jaques Station is already serving as a base would render such an operation pointless, the Fuel Rats spokesperson answered:

\We fully expect Jaques to continue his journey at some point, and since his station simply can't produce enough fuel to make that possible, sooner or later an outpost will be necessary.\

* Galactic News: Curious Developments in Tionisla
For the first time in over a hundred years, a new ship has been added to the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard. Established in the 3100s, the mausoleum was originally a resting place for the rich and famous, but in the economic slump that befell the Old Worlds during that period, the graveyard fell into disuse.

With many of its relics vandalised or looted, it came as something of a surprise when the Tionisla government received a request to inter a recently deceased Commander.

Despite the unusual circumstances, the government of Tionisla processed the application with surprising swiftness, prompting speculation that the individual may have been some kind of celebrity.

Just before the vessel was moved to its final resting place, an onboard beacon briefly activated, transmitting a repeating sequence of curious characters. This continued for a few minutes until a power failure silenced it. The message read \OTSEAFOTSEAF\. The significance of the transmission, if any, is unclear.

\I wouldn't worry about it,\ said Grace Mayweather of the Tionisla government. \We see this sort of thing all the time. It's just a last bit of mischief from the recently deceased. Tricks, codes \u2013 sometimes even traps for the unwary. People go mad trying to work these things out, but they never mean anything.\

The identity of the Commander in question is not known, but the ship was identified as an antique Cobra Mk III with the unusual hull registry of 'Cor meum et animam'.


* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Appeals for Help
The image transmitted by the mysterious Unknown Probes is still a mystery. But while the image occupies his teams, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group believes there is more to discover about the Probes themselves. The problem is supply.

\The only known sources of Unknown Probes are Federal military convoys in the Ross 47, G 99-49, Wolf 294 and Wolf 504 systems.\

\The Federal military apparently knows where the Probes can be found, but they're keeping it a secret, so it's up to us to lift the veil.\

\Since Unknown Artefacts are found in a 135-150 light year shell around Merope, we believe the probes are in a similar region \u2013 possibly even the same region. We also think they will be found in anomalous signal sources, the same as the Artefacts.\

\So please help science, and break the Federal monopoly on these Probes. It could be the most important thing you ever do.\

* Galactic News: Federal Campaign Concludes
Federal President Zachary Hudson has announced that the Federal appeal for construction materials received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Hundreds of independent pilots supported the campaign by delivering autofabricators, tantalum and superconductors to Brady Horizons in the Gooheimar system, which will allow the Federation to start work on the first of three new Farragut-class Battlecruisers.

In a brief statement, President Hudson thanked those who had contributed to the initiative.

\I want to thank you for your support. The passionate response to this appeal gives me hope that the Federation faces a bright future \u2013 one in which we can meet any threat that confronts us.\


* Galactic News: Ambika Campaign Concludes
The Union Party of Ambika has announced that its two-pronged relief campaign has received the full support of the galactic community. Huge deliveries of food were received at Goulart City, and the agitators attempting to disrupt the relief operation have been neutralised.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:

\We are deeply grateful to all those who supported this campaign. Without your intervention, I fear that Ambika could have been plunged into a humanitarian crisis. The food supplies delivered to Goulart City will now be distributed throughout the system.\


* Community Goal: The Fight for Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16
Recent reports from the Empire-controlled Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-16 system indicate that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, a Federal organisation, is preparing to launch an assault with the aim of taking the region from the Empire.

A spokesperson for the Imperial Inquisition, which is coordinating the Imperial resistance, said:

\I would not surrender so much as an inch of territory to the Federation \u2013 I am certainly not about to surrender Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-16. I hope the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is prepared for a fight.\

The Imperial Inquisition has asked all Empire-aligned pilots to travel to Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-16 and help repel the Federal offensive. Similarly, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has issued a call to arms to all Federation-aligned fighters.

The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has set out a week-long operation to take control of the system, which will begin on the 11th of August 3302.


* Freelance Report: Buckyball Racing Club Salutes Heroes of Bast
On the 30th of June 3301, Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system was quarantined due to the outbreak of a mysterious plague. This pathogen \u2013 named the Cerberus Plague \u2013 eventually spread to over 20 systems and claimed 100,000 lives.

Thanks to the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, a cure derived from Ceremonial Heike Tea was discovered and used to treat victims at Hart Station in the Bast System. The cure was then synthesised, mass produced and shipped to other affected systems. On the 10th of August 3301, the last affected systems were declared free of the Cerberus Plague.

In tribute to these pilots' heroic efforts, the Buckyball Racing Club is hosting a special event at Hart Station. The race will involve a scramble around nearby medicine-production facilities and a speed run to Brunel City in Heike.

* Galactic News: Economic Turmoil Ahead?
According to the Galactic Finance Times, analysis of the largest corporations in the Federation and the Empire reveals evidence of a significant economic downturn in the coming years.

\We're seeing poor revenue forecasts for a wide range of corporations, including big names like Sirius, Gutamaya and Core Dynamics,\ said a correspondent for the Galactic Finance Times. \They should be concentrating on marketing to leverage new product ranges, but instead they're diverting resources into intensive research and development. They're ignoring the traditional sales cycle, and we don't know why. It's perplexing.\

Shareholders have seen poor returns on their investments in recent months, with stock prices dropping across multiple sectors, although this has given others a chance to pick up stock at bargain prices. Several of the pertinent corporations were contacted by the Galactic Finance Times, but none deigned to respond.

Despite the GFT's report, some commentators blame the downturn on the London Treaty, which was signed by the galaxy's three major powers in 3278 following the introduction of the frame shift drive. The treaty enforces strict tonnage limitations for capital ships, and was aimed at preventing an arms race, but in recent years it has come to be perceived as a barrier to economic development.

One option for investors looking for a risky but possibly lucrative venture is a start-up called MetaDrive Inc., a small company based in the Chi Orionis system specialising in hyperdrive research. The company is reported to be seeking investment.


* Galactic News: The Thargoids
Continuing our series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the Thargoids.

\Are we alone in the universe? It's a question we've been asking for millennia. Even before we expanded into space, we wondered about the possibility of non-human intelligence.\

\Of course, for some, the question has already been answered. We have seen the aliens and we have given them a name: the Thargoids. But accounts of Thargoid encounters are shrouded in so much ambiguity, it is hard to accept them as proof of extraterrestrial intelligence. Furthermore, there have been no credible reports of Thargoid sightings for hundreds of years.\

\The first reported Thargoid encounters date from 3125, when accounts surfaced that pilots had been pulled from witch-space and attacked by mysterious octagonal starships. Witnesses asserted that the strange vessels were exceptionally fast and remarkably manoeuvrable. Pilots who survived these experiences were convinced they had encountered extraterrestrials, and named the aliens 'Thargoids'.\

\As news of these encounters spread, rumours surfaced that the interdictions might be a response to an earlier human attack. Leaked Federal intelligence indicated that colonists in the Veliaze system had encountered and assaulted an extraterrestrial deputation shortly before the Thargoid interdictions began. Suggestions that the Thargoid attacks were a reaction to this attack carried more than a hint of plausibility.\

\Not long after, reports of Thargoid encounters came to an abrupt halt. In the decades that followed, not one credible account of a Thargoid encounter was reported. For some, this was proof that the original reports were groundless \u2013 'the fantasies of lonely pilots, looking for attention', as Arvan Corto of the Imperial Navy said at the time.\

\But public opinion shifted in 3250 when reports emerged that the disappearance of the Thargoids might have been a direct consequence of a covert anti-Thargoid operation. An anonymous message, delivered to a number of media outlets, claimed that an organisation known as the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm had developed a chemical weapon specifically designed to target Thargoid technology. This chemical \u2013 known as the mycoid virus \u2013 was designed to attack plastic polymers, which were believed to be present in Thargoid hyperdrive systems. The fact that the virus also appeared to harm the Thargoids led to speculation that the aliens' bodies might contain some kind of polymer-like material.  The report was dismissed by many leading political figures as a conspiracy theory, but some asserted that it contained enough plausible detail be believable.\

\Since then, very little credible information has emerged. The original accounts from 3125 report that Thargoid ships can execute huge hyperspace jumps, while information purportedly from INRA documents indicates that the Thargoids originate from an ammonia-based world. There are even rumours that the Thargoids have a collective consciousness or 'hive mind'. Some of the less outlandish theories include the suggestion that electronic countermeasure technology was reverse-engineered from captured Thargoid vessels.\

\And what of the barnacles, Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probes? Many believe these objects are of non-human origin, which has led to speculation that they were created by the Thargoids. Unfortunately, however, analysis of these objects has not yielded any concrete information about their origin or purpose.\

\Are the Thargoids real? Frankly, I don't know. But if they are, their true nature can only be guessed at.\

* Galactic News: Salom\u00e9 - Traitor or Terrorist?
The Imperial Citizen has published a scathing two-part editorial on an individual by the name of Commander Salom\u00e9, alleging that she is in fact Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, the missing Imperial senator.

\We note with dismay that a certain Commander Salom\u00e9 has resurfaced once again. Many will be unaware of her activities, obscured as they are by her carefully cultivated innocence and charm, so it falls to the Imperial Citizen to reveal the sordid truth. She is Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, the disgraced senator.\

\Although Salom\u00e9 enjoyed the comforts and privileges afforded to most high-born Imperial children, her parents had little use for a third daughter and shipped her off to boarding school at the first opportunity. This served only to foster Salom\u00e9's sense of rebelliousness and her disdain for her family.\

\Despite her privileged upbringing, Salom\u00e9 grew up to be petty, mean and bitter. But she was also shrewd and politically astute, successfully avoiding an arranged marriage by palming off her would-be husband onto one of her older sisters.\

\Salom\u00e9 hated her father, but despite her antipathy, she was clearly influenced by him. After all, this was the man who expelled colonists from the Chione moon in 3297 by bombing it \u2013 an act condemned as a war crime by the Federation.\

\Loren's family was murdered in 3300 by a group of freedom fighters known as Reclamists, but she was somehow spirited safely away. She claims to have been kidnapped, abused and held to ransom, only to overcome her enemies and return the Prism system to Imperial control after a battle with the Federation. The truth is that she did nothing of the sort.\


* Galactic News: Felicia Winters Opposes Federal-Imperial Conflict
At a rally on Mars in the Sol system, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters has addressed the escalating tension between the Federation and the Empire.

While careful not to criticise Federal President Zachary Hudson, Winters made her position on the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict clear. Addressing citizens who had gathered to support her, the shadow president said:

\I may disagree with Edmund Mahon on a number of issues, but I share his views on the current political climate.\

\Both the Federation and the Empire have access to tremendous military power, and a war between our two societies could have a disastrous impact on the galaxy. We must turn away from acrimony, and move towards mutual understanding and cooperation. It is not too late to change course.\

Winters's words were warmly received by the assembled crowds.

* Community Goal: Restoring Order in Arque
Authorities in the Arque system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.

To counter this threat, Arque Commodities has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Austen Town Station.

The campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Federation Takes Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16
Following a week of conflict, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has confirmed that the Federation has taken control of the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16 system, having ousted the incumbent Imperial Inquisition. In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation thanked the many Federal pilots who took part in the operation.

\This victory brings with it the promise of a brighter tomorrow \u2013 a brighter tomorrow for the people of IH-V C2-16, who are now free from the dehumanising influence of the Empire, and a brighter tomorrow for the Federation, which has gained a valuable strategic asset.\


* Community Goal: The Colonia Initiative
The Colonia Nebula is a relatively innocuous region of space encompassing the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. It is also likely to become a major bastion of humanity in the years to come.

Public interest in the Colonia Nebula was piqued by the arrival in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 of Jaques Station, which dropped into the system after making an unsuccessful attempt to jump to Beagle Point. In the weeks that followed, pilots started ferrying goods to Jaques Station to repair the damaged starport \u2013 an initiative that captured the imagination of the galactic community. The region soon became a focus for those who fear that a war between the Federation and the Empire may be looming, and who hope to escape it.

A coordinated campaign to establish a permanent outpost in the region, organised by the 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction, is already underway and a second is about to begin. The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has announced plans to establish an outpost in the Colonia Nebula, and has placed an open order for materials for use in the construction.

A spokesperson for the organisation said:

\A new beginning. A new tomorrow. That's what the Colonia Nebula represents. A chance to create an interstellar community free from the internecine conflicts that blight so much of inhabited space. With your help, we can make it happen.\

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has promised to reward pilots who deliver titanium, semiconductors and robotics to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for two weeks.

* Galactic News: Salom\u00e9 \u2013 Pride or Prejudice?
The Imperial Citizen has published its second editorial on Commander Salom\u00e9, who the Citizen alleges is Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, the missing Imperial senator.

\According to Lady Kahina's account, she escaped a hardened gang of freedom fighters and faced down a notorious pirate lord. Is it not more likely that she colluded with these terrorists to murder her family so she could become a senator? Is it not convenient that she slaughtered these terrorists before they could be questioned, and then did the same to her mentor? And with a sword, too.\

\Don't forget that Kahina almost triggered a war between the Empire and the Federation. Thousands died in that battle \u2013 a battle she started. Heroine of the Prism system? Hardly. She was responsible for the largest loss of life that Imperial outpost ever saw, exceeding even her father's appalling legacy.\

\Not content with acquiring her father's senatorial position via her so-called 'reclamation', Lady Kahina then gallivanted around the core worlds trying to gain support in a bid to become Emperor. She soon found, however, that her self-image was out of step with reality. But did she return to her supposedly beloved homeworld? Of course not. She disappeared for several months only to reappear, as if she were the patron saint of explorers, on the far side of the galaxy in the Distant Worlds Expedition.\

\Along the way she engendered the support of misfits, miscreants, starry-eyed explorers and dissident organisations masquerading as legitimate factions. Why she seeks such support is not known.\

\Have no doubt \u2013 this so-called 'lady' is no saint. Whatever she does is solely to further her own interests, manipulating those around her as she has always done. She is clearly deluded, but her powers of persuasion are formidable. Many have sworn loyalty to her, particularly those disaffected by the politics of the core worlds.\

\Beautiful and charismatic she may be, but she is also a bloodthirsty, selfish and manipulative individual who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals. Do not trust a word she says.\


* Galactic News: Generation Ships
Continuing our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses generation ships.

\Before the development of faster-than-light travel, colonising distant star systems was a profoundly difficult proposition. For the people of the 21st Century, the answer was the generation ship. These vast interstellar arks, equipped with everything needed to sustain human life, were crewed by multiple successive generations \u2013 pioneers who were born, lived and died aboard a starship.\

\The first generation ship was launched in 2097, and in the centuries that followed, many more set off into the vastness of space. Most of these ambitious expeditions were funded by large corporations, and the penalties for interfering with them were severe, given the enormous cost of mobilising them.\

\At the time of writing, there are believed to be somewhere in the region of 70,000 generation ships coursing through the galaxy. The approximate location of most of these ships has been calculated, but not all are accounted for. Many of the corporations that funded the original generation ships have now been dissolved or assimilated by other organisations, so it is difficult to determine exactly who is responsible for some of these vessels.\

\It has been theorised that some of the original generation ships may soon reach their destinations, but since not all of those destinations are known, it is entirely possible that they could have been colonised while the generation ships were in transit. We can only hope the powers-that-be have a contingency strategy for such a scenario.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This report presents the latest data on conflict among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a civil war:

Boloine Blue Federal Int

Kikua Empire Party

LTT 8260 Solutions

HIP 12716 Boys

Mislika Movement

Denebola Blue Adv Commodities

Party of Denebola

Calor Party

Raiders of Calor

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

Byel Tan Jet United Corp.

Canary Mining Corporation

Bipek Labour

Kolaga Republic Party

Nagybold Major Holdings

The Black Fleet

Natural Namamasairu Flag

Traditional Parenni Autocracy

Granthaimi Gold Mob

LTT 9164 Democrats

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Unknown Probe Transmission Decrypted by Canonn
The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has discovered, recorded and translated a tight-beam transmission from an Unknown Probe directed at Merope 5c.

Research into the Probes has so far been hindered by their scarcity, but with the increasing number of Probes being found, transmission analysis efforts have ramped up, leading to successful decryption. The transmission was found to contain blocks of octal numbers describing planetary data such as radius, surface temperature, gravity and atmospheric composition.

The nature of the 'receiver' on Merope 5c is now under investigation.

* Galactic News: Assassination Attempt on Patreus Thwarted
Recent reports indicate that an attempt was made on the life of Admiral Denton Patreus as he delivered a speech at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system. The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that it apprehended three individuals carrying firearms who attempted to approach the admiral's podium.

Following the incident, Admiral Patreus appeared slightly shaken but said: \I will never submit to terror. These individuals will be brought to justice.\

Subsequent reports identified the culprits as belonging to the organisation Emperor's Dawn, but it is rumoured that the dissidents were bankrolled and supported by a second party.

\Emperor's Dawn was smashed \u2013 it's history,\ said a researcher for the Imperial Citizen. \Someone else was behind this \u2013 someone with a major grudge against Patreus.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Lundji Major Corporation

Earls of LHS 283

Byel Tan Jet United Corp.

Canary Mining Corporation

Nidarijedi Empire Party

Traditional Velliep Justice Party

Ch'anjie Netcoms Commodities

Gabri Labour

Wolf 1414 Nobles

Tomani Blue State Co

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

New Wolf 248 Independents

Chinicollo League

Paletes Order

Social Mombawet Revolutionary Party

Confederacy of Mandubii

Nisgayo for Equality

United LHS 1101 for Equality

Vetta Bureau

Official Huano Regulatory State

Negidals Co

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Cemiess Commodities

HIP 296 Guardians of Tradition

BD+23 3151 Camorra

LTT 874 Empire Assembly

Imenhit Limited

Nang Ta-khian Public Co

Social Caelinus Union

Aztlan Hand Gang

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

HIP 37171 Blue Rats

HIP 118169 Democrats

Keries Camorra

Regulatory State of HIP 32812

Chamunda Crimson Gang

Progressive Party of Wu Guinagi

Kini Travel Co

HIP 30953 Defence Force

Carthage Silver Drug Empire

Batz Independents

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Commander Salom\u00e9 Hijacked in Cemiess
Recent articles published by the Imperial Citizen may have inspired an act of violence in the Cemiess system over the weekend. Commander Nodus Cursorius of the Chapterhouse of Inquisition reported a transmission from Commander Salom\u00e9 of the Children of Raxxla, indicating that her ship had been attacked by unknown forces.

A transcript of Commander Salom\u00e9's distress call follows:

\Heavy fire...mayday! Imperial markings! Traitors... Shields are down, we're taking damage...it's... I thought I sensed his arrogance! How dare... We're being boarded. I only have moments. Please get word to the Children of Raxxla, tell them I have new information. The Rift, Hawkin's Gap and the Conflux are connected with strange happenings in the Pleiades. They must find out before...\

At that point Commander Salom\u00e9's transmission was silenced. Despite a thorough search, no sign of her has yet been found.

The Imperial Citizen had suggested that Commander Salom\u00e9 is in fact Senator Kahina Tijani Loren of the Prism system. The publication also implied that she had engineered the events that led to her family's death in order to position herself as heiress of the Loren family dynasty.

* Community Goal: More Imperial Warships
The latest development in the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict takes the form of a statement from Admiral Denton Patreus, who has announced plans to add three new Majestic-class Interdictors to the Imperial fleet. The announcement comes only a week after the successful conclusion of a Federal campaign to amass material for three new Farragut-class Battlecruisers.

In a candid statement, Admiral Patreus said:

\We cannot stand idly by while the Federation attempts to establish a monopoly over the meta-alloys. And if the Empire does not oppose the Federation, who will?\

\So as long as the Federation continues to expand its navy, we will continue to match it, ship for ship.\

The Empire has placed an open order for supplies and has authorised the Morai Nobles to reward pilots who deliver autofabricators, tantalum and superconductors to van de Hulst Vision in the Morai system.

The campaign begins on the 25th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

A spokesperson for 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 released the following statement:

\If we're going to settle in the Colonia Nebula then we need to know more about it, which is why we're currently offering highly competitive rates for exploration data. After all, pilots will be making the trek out to Jaques anyway \u2013 might as well make some credits en route.\

80 DD-D 774-CE-2 has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 25th of August 3302 and will run for four weeks.

* Galactic News: Explorers Urged to be Cautious
In his keynote speech at a recent conference, Karl Devene, head of the Federal Astrocartography Department, warned would-be explorers of the dangers of venturing into the void:

\While there are some very well-organised expeditions, many are poorly prepared and have no goals beyond pursuing ridiculous myths echoing back from the edge of inhabited space. It is dangerous and irresponsible to venture into uncharted areas without proper discipline.\

\What we need is sound astrocartographic data \u2013 not a bunch of amateurs traipsing all over the place and making a complete mess of the whole situation.\

\I will be making deputations to various authorities to curtail these activities and leave exploration in the hands of the professionals.\

\If humanity finds itself in a first-contact position, do we really want some grubby, ill-prepared spacer to be our envoy? I think not.\

* Galactic News: Enigmatic Message Received
News feeds throughout the galaxy have received a mysterious message from an as-yet undetermined source.

The message, which is reprinted in full below, appears to contain an oblique reference to a particular location, but the nature of the communiqu\u00e9 makes it hard to determine exactly what it refers to.

\We've found something. Something incredible. Something the whole galaxy will want to see. The truth.\

\We could show it to you, but that wouldn't be much fun. So instead we're going to play a little game.\

\It begins on the 28th. We'll be waiting for you.\

The Federal Security Service, aware that the message will pique the interest of the galactic community, said:

\Frankly, I suspect this is some kind of hoax, but there will inevitably be some who attempt to unravel the mystery. All we can do is urge them to exercise caution.\


* Galactic News: Problems at MetaDrive?
Independent auditor BigSix has reported various anomalies in the accounts of MetaDrive Inc., a company based in the Chi Orionis system specialising in hyperdrive research.

\It's a big mess,\ said the senior auditor of BigSix. \The company is being placed in receivership. It needs a buyer, and quickly.\

Femi Dakarai, the chairman of MetaDrive Inc., was not available for comment.

Following the news, shares in MetaDrive Inc. plummeted. But a short time later, Sirius Corp unexpectedly volunteered to prop up the company.

\We've been interested in collaboration for a while,\ said the marketing manager of Sirius Corp's hyperdrive research division, \and were in talks over licensing MetaDrive's exciting new technology. We have no desire to see them go under.\

* Galactic News: Prospects for Malfunctioning Starports Improving
Technical personnel at New Dawn Station in the Ceos system have announced a breakthrough in the ongoing fight against the so-called technological plague.

Tag Arthurs, head of the starport's technical team, released the following statement to news feeds:

\Although our understanding of meta-alloys remains incomplete, we are now able to apply them much more efficiently. Consequently, we now need much smaller quantities of meta-alloys to return a malfunctioning starport to functionality \u2013 half as much as we used to, in fact.\

\We've also determined that the week immediately following the first signs of Unknown Artefact-related interference is a critical one. If an affected starport can be supplied with meta-alloys within that week, it is far less likely that the situation at the starport will worsen.\

* Galactic News: Mysterious Wreckage Discovered
A pair of independent pilots by the names of Noctrach and Ihazevich has discovered the remains of what appears to be a starship on planet 9a of the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system. The discovery represents the culmination of a galaxy-wide hunt coordinated by the 'Granger Gang' \u2013 a band of miscreants led by the smuggler and bounty hunter Otto Granger.

The event began with a cryptic message delivered by Granger to news feeds throughout the galaxy. This was followed by a series of enigmatic clues, inserted into news channels at a number of starports.

Solving these clues led pilots to the three members of the Granger Gang: Otto Granger, Mahina Dillon and Logan Khol. When confronted, Granger and his companions claimed to have made a discovery of profound importance, but they refused to reveal the nature or location of this discovery.

Instead, each member of the gang said they would issue a request for a specific commodity, promising to reveal further information if they received what they asked for. Logan Khol's subsequent request for narcotics was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, and when his targets were met, a further clue was released:

\The latitude was -26 and it was a cold moon in the Pleiades sector with the letters 'AB' in its name.\

Although the Granger Gang planned to release further clues, they were quickly rendered redundant. Within hours of Khol releasing his information to the public, Commanders Noctrach and Ihazevich discovered the mysterious wreckage.

Commentators throughout the galaxy have been quick to offer their opinions on this remarkable discovery.

\I'm familiar with every starship design of the past fifty years, and most of the older ones, too,\ said Augustus Sym, an Imperial veteran and former test pilot based in the Achenar system, \and I've never seen anything like it. There's no doubt in my mind \u2013 that is an alien ship.\

Others have adopted a more cautious stance, while acknowledging that the find could be significant. Professor Ishmael Palin, a leading authority on xeno-biological research, said:

\I have always been open to the possibility of intelligent non-human life, and this wreck may indeed be an alien vessel. But I will withhold judgement until further evidence is released, or at least until I have an opportunity to inspect the site myself!\


* Galactic News: Imperial Initiative Comes to an End
Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the Imperial appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. A spokesperson for the Morai Nobles, which helped to coordinate the campaign, confirmed that scores of Imperial pilots supported the initiative to construct three new Majestic-class Interdictors by delivering supplies to van de Hulst Vision in the Morai system.

As the campaign concluded, Admiral Patreus issued a statement:

\Once again, the galaxy's Imperial pilots have shown themselves to be industrious and resourceful.

It is individuals like you who make the Empire what it is.\

\Construction of the new ships will begin at once.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from de Hulst Vision.


* Galactic News: Colonia Campaign Concludes
The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has announced that its campaign to establish a new outpost in the Colonia Nebula has received the unqualified support of the galactic community. Hundreds of independent pilots responded to the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Jaques Station, the organisation's base of operations.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:

\Future generations will look back on this day as the dawn of a new era. An era defined not by conflict, but by unity. An era in which we made the Colonia Nebula our home.\


* Community Goal: LFT 133 in Need
The AEF Legion of LFT 133 has issued an appeal to the galactic community for help in compiling an order of gold. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the LFT 133 system to ensure that those delivering gold can do so safely.

Pilots who deliver gold to Sullivan Dock, and who help neutralise the agitators operating in the LFT 133 system, will be rewarded.

The campaign begins on 1st of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Freelance Report: Mysterious Wreck could be an Artefact of the Past
The discovery of what appears to be the remains of a non-human spacecraft has sent ripples of fear and curiosity through the galaxy.

\Many are speculating that this is evidence of recent Thargoid activity,\ said Professor Steven Eisler of the Okinura Xenobiology Institute, \but it's more likely that the wreckage dates from our first encounters with the Thargoids.\

\What I find disturbing are the messages and clues that led to this xeno-archaeological find. Someone is deliberately preying on mankind's fear of the unknown, and they need to be held accountable for their actions.\

* Galactic News: United Research Council Announces New Programme
The United Research Council, one of the galaxy's largest independent scientific organisations, has announced an ambitious new research programme.

The programme, which is expected to last approximately six weeks, will initially encompass all systems within a 30 light-year radius of the Coritab, Darian, Freng and Lunduwalaya systems. Other systems may be added to the list as the programme progresses.

The Alliance, the Empire and the Federation have all agreed to grant the Council exclusive access to these systems for the duration of its research programme. Civilian and military traffic will be free to traverse the region, but pilots pledged to one of the galaxy's major powers will be unable to lay claim to these systems while the project is active.

Professor Ray Miller, director of the organisation, elaborated on the nature of the exercise:

\The programme is in most respects unremarkable \u2013 we will be monitoring radiation levels, recording the positions of celestial bodies, and so on \u2013 but it is also highly sensitive. The passage of a single ship will not disturb our experiments, but large-scale activity could prove highly disruptive.\

\We thank the galactic community in advance for its understanding.\

Sources in the Achenar system have revealed that an individual identified only as 'a senior member of the Imperial hierarchy' has been arrested in connection with the recent assassination attempt on Admiral Denton Patreus.

Although the individual's identity is not known, a security officer let slip that the person in question is \no stranger to controversy\. The suspect is believed to have been placed under house arrest.

Speculation abounds as to the identity of the individual and to the evident instability within the Imperial power base.

\A house divided against itself cannot stand,\ quipped one Imperial patron, who asked not to be identified. \History teaches us that much.\

Six months have elapsed since Doctor Elana Lorax warned against the exploitation of the non-human structures commonly called barnacles. In her plea, she noted that aggressive harvesting could jeopardise efforts to produce a viable synthetic alternative to meta-alloys.

Despite President Zachary Hudson's claim that the purpose of the Federal deputation in the Merope system is to protect the non-human structures, independent pilots report that the system's barnacles have been entirely depleted.

Commander Vindicator Jones shared his observations:

\Just went to Merope 5c to check out the barnacles. They've been destroyed. I've tried visiting several, but they're all barren.\

It is not known why the Federation has acted inversely to its stated objectives, particularly given President Hudson's acknowledgement that the barnacles may possess some form of sentience.

Doctor Lorax could not be reached for comment, but it is becoming increasingly clear that we should have heeded her warnings.

* Freelance Report: Out of Reach, Not Out of Mind
Following recent reports of a possible alien wreck in the Pleiades, the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released further information about the Unknown Probe.

Shortly after planetary data was found in the Probe's tight-beam transmission, a message was sent to the Canonn from a pilot by the name of Commander Wace. It read: \The headerless octal number - it is distance compared to Merope!\

A list of data followed, obtained by monitoring the Unknown Probe in different systems. The octal number was shown to steadily decrease as Commander Wace neared the permit-locked Col 70 Sector.

In an impressive display of field mathematics, Commander Wace pin-pointed the Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 system as the Probe's 'zero point'. Unfortunately, the Canonn is prevented from further investigation of the system by the permit lock of the Col 70 Sector.

LHS 140 Jet Universal Company

Revolutionary Ross 878 Resistance

Liberty Party of Bodedi

Kuukese Hand Gang

Ququve Silver Life Organisation

Ququve Gold Drug Empire

Zhonvenk Jet Transport and Co

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

Tewinicnii Vision Corporation

LHS 3564 Conservatives

BD-20 2665 State Organisation

Progressive Party of Nawait

Black Aegis

Civitas Dei

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Eol Prou Campaign Concludes
Last month, the 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction launched an ambitious four-week initiative to amass material for a new planetary outpost in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign was a resounding success, attracting pilots from across the galaxy and resulting in the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of osmium for use in the construction.

In a statement, the organisation's spokesperson said:

\We're real pleased with the response, and we're going to start work on the outpost just as soon as we can.\

The spokesperson was asked why he thought the galactic community was so eager to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.

\Well the way I see it, people are getting tired of the superpowers and their petty disputes. As a species, we've come a mighty long way \u2013 it'd be a real shame if all that progress amounted to was a fight over territory and resources.\

\People want to make a fresh start, and they're thinking Eol Prou could be just the place to do it.\


* Galactic News: Galactic Leaders Respond to Discovery
The leaders of the galaxy's major powers have responded to the discovery of a mysterious shipwreck in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system.

Speaking from the Imperial Palace on Capitol, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

\This is a potentially momentous discovery that could signify the dawn of a new era. I speak for all Imperial citizens when I say that the Empire faces this new era with optimism.\

Meanwhile, Federal President Zachary Hudson released a statement from his office at the White House on Mars:

\Like many of you, I have watched this story unfold with mounting astonishment. I want to assure all Federal citizens \u2013 and, indeed, all members of the galactic community \u2013 that the Federation is ready for whatever lies ahead.\

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon struck a more measured tone in his statement:

\The discovery is unquestionably a remarkable one, but at this stage it would be irresponsible to speculate on its implications. I will say only that, at this point in time, the need for solidarity has never been greater. It is my sincerest wish that the human race moves forward as one, united in purpose and philosophy.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

BD-20 2665 State Organisation

Progressive Party of Nawait

Guincans Legal PLC

Quaaybuwan Partnership

Bidiono Independents

Tewi Guardians of Tradition

Elite German Commanders

New BD-18 394 Autocracy

Raba Solutions

Dukes of Lepchaimyu

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Social Savii Confederacy\t

New Arexack Law Party

LTT 617 Regulatory State

Surmati Limited

Olurung Blue Legal PLC

Pa Para Partners

LAWD 8 Major Corp.

61 Ursae Majoris Liberals

Nuakea Republic Party

Democrats of Ruwachis

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Aditi Jet Universal Interstellar

Kikapu Stakeholders

CdE Corporation

Traditional Chamunda Nationalists

Revolutionary Nemehi Future

Vortex Continuum

Values Party of Nervi

Nebula Goat Appreciation Society

Chamunda Crimson Travel Exchange

Tun Dynamic Corp.

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Much Ado about Nothing?
Recent statements from Professor Steven Eisler of the Okinura Xenobiology Institute appear to have frustrated large sections of the scientific community.

Darius Maddox, presenter of weekly science broadcast The Face of the Universe, said, \Eisler isn't a field scientist \u2013 he's an academic \u2013 and to throw around the T-word every time humanity encounters something it doesn't understand is irresponsible.\

Eisler responded to the criticism:

\I'm not leaping to the conclusion that the object in the Pleiades is of Thargoid origin. I only meant that if it is Thargoid, it's likely to be a relic of the past.\

\It's true that I haven't done much field science recently, but I plan to visit the site soon, and I'll be looking for indications of whether this is a recent find or something that has been sitting on the surface for a while.\

* Freelance Report: Buckyball Presents Heavy Metal Megadeth
Following the success of the Total Recall 2 event, the Pilots Federation has asked the Buckyball Racing Club to help it investigate a pressing safety issue.

Since the start of the year, the Pilots Federation has noticed a sharp increase in the number of crash landings on high-gravity planets. To assess whether or not ship thrusters require an across-the-board power increase, the organisation has asked the Buckyball Racing Club to organise an event that pushes ships to their maximum tolerance during high-gravity landings.

To this end, the Buckyball Racing club invites pilots to gather at Cook Gateway in the Medzistha system. After departing from Cook Gateway, pilots must perform a single hyperspace jump to Omicron Capricorni B, land on planet A4 - anywhere - and return to Cook Gateway.

Pilots are warned that Omicron Capricorni B A 4 has a surface gravity of 4g, so extreme caution should be exercised when exiting orbital cruise.

The event will run from 00.00 UTC on the 6th of September until 23.59 UTC on the 11th of September.

* Freelance Report: Weird Science
As the scientific community grapples with the discovery of mysterious wreckage in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system, controversial naturalist Ulla Burton believes she has the answer.

In her most recent broadcast, Ulla said:

\The answer is staring us in the face \u2013 it's a form of giant space crab. I'm surprised the Canonn Institute hasn't considered it. The creature was obviously confused by frame shift emissions, and beached itself while looking for food.\

While answering viewers' questions, Ulla dismissed suggestions that the remains were dangerous or indicative of the existence of intelligent life.

\The chances of anything coming from the Pleiades, or beyond, are a million to one. Other than the space trees the Federation is guarding, there's nothing in that remote, forbidding area. The Unknown Probes are nothing more than space fungi. The Canonn should stop misleading people with its pseudo-science.\

* Galactic News: United Research Council Programme Begins in One Week
The United Research Council has announced that its postponed research programme will begin on the 15th of September 3302. The announcement comes a week after political lobbying prompted the Council to temporarily delay the programme.

The Council's experiments, which are understood to involve monitoring radiation levels and recording the positions of celestial bodies, will encompass all systems within a 30 light-year radius of the Clayakarma, Nauo, Gyhldekala, Boga and Kpaniya systems. Due to the sensitive nature of these experiments, pilots pledged to one of the galaxy's major powers will be unable to lay claim to these systems while the project is active. Pilots should also be aware that any preparatory activity conducted in these systems will be negated when the programme begins.

The United Research Council will make a final announcement shortly before the programme starts.


* Community Goal: Federal-Imperial Conflict in Mu Koji
Security operatives in Mu Koji have reported that the Empire and Federation have launched rival military operations in the system.

Both superpowers have fleets stationed in Mu Koji, and both have launched attacks against these convoys with the aim of securing valuable enemy intelligence.

The Xuangu Crimson Major Network has been authorised to coordinate the Imperial operation, while rival organisation the Mu Koji Resistance is directing the Federal campaign. Both factions have asked independent combat pilots for support, promising to reward those who come to their aid.

The rival operations are scheduled to run for one week from the 8th of September 3302.

A spokesperson for the AEF Legion of LFT 133 has announced that its appeal for gold has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Sullivan Dock, the organisation's base of operations. The spokesperson also confirmed that the agitators disrupting operations in the region have been neutralised.

The AEF Legion of LFT 133 has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.


* Galactic News: Imperial Ships Deployed to Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4
For much of the past week, the galactic community has been captivated by the mysterious shipwreck discovered in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system. The wreck, which was found on one of the system's moons, is believed by many to be the remains of a non-human starship.

Given the magnitude of the discovery, it was only a matter of time before one of the superpowers took action. That action has come in the form of an Imperial deputation, which was despatched to the system within the past twelve hours. Eyewitness reports indicate that a Majestic-class Interdictor has taken up position directly over the shipwreck site.

The Empire has not commented on the deployment, but Federal President Zachary Hudson was quick to condemn the act.

\It is no surprise that the Empire is attempting to control the site, but the fact is that they have no authority in AB-W B2-4, and no right to lay claim to this discovery. If the Empire makes any effort to prevent access to the site, be assured that the Federation will respond appropriately.\


* Freelance Report: The Alien Wreck
As independent pilots flock to the mysterious wreckage in the Pleiades, many have been speculating on the meaning of the discovery. Some believe the wreck is of Thargoid origin, but that rumour has little evidence to support it.

One pilot who visited the site shared his opinion:

\While the alien wreck is worthy of further study, I doubt it's recent. Judging from the lack of heat signature, I think it's been dead for a while \u2013 maybe even centuries. It's hard to tell how old something is with a simple visual inspection, especially on a planet with no atmosphere.\

\I suspect it won't be long before the Federation or the Empire tries to claim the wreckage, so we probably don't have much time to study it.\

Independent pilots are still flocking to the site, but many questions remain. Possible links to the barnacles, Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probes have been suggested, but no evidence of a connection has been found.

* Galactic News: We Have a Winner!
A pilot by the name of Commander Falchion has won the Melee Masters arena competition.

In a tense final bout, Commander Falchion appeared to give up right on the cusp of victory, but it was revealed to have been a ruse designed to bring his opponent into firing range.

A reporter from Sports Zeta Weekly commented: \I had no fingernails by the end of that one. The sheer moxie of Commander Falchion, to sucker in his opponent like that! Big risk, big payoff. The crowds loved it! A worthy winner.\

Commander Falchion was not available for interview and appears to maintaining a cloak of anonymity, although it is known that he or she is from the Chi Orionis system.


* Galactic News: Otto Granger Demands Credit
Otto Granger, the smuggler who involved the galactic community in an elaborate search for the mysterious debris in the Pleiades Nebula, has demanded that he receive credit for the discovery.

In an interview with The Federal Times, Granger made his feelings clear:

\Look, I admit it \u2013 when we found the wreck, we saw it as an opportunity to make some money. But we never planned to keep the discovery from the public.\

\The point is that we found it \u2013 me and my friends. But now the discovery has been credited to someone else! It's outrageous!\

Commentators have been quick to point out that Granger's efforts to profit from the discovery, and his reluctance to share it with the galactic community in a spirit of altruism, are sufficient grounds to deny him credit.

* Community Goal: The Colonia Connection
Latugara PLC, an independent organisation based in the Latugara system, has announced plans to construct a series of outposts between the core of human-inhabited space and the rapidly expanding Colonia Nebula community.

In a statement, the organisation's spokesperson said:

\Given the relatively remote nature of the Colonia community, there's a clear need for a series of resupply outposts to support ships travelling to and from the colony. These new bases will bridge the gap between the burgeoning Colonia community and the core systems.\

In support of this ambitious initiative, Latugara PLC has placed an open order for titanium, computer components and power generators, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to its base of operations at Love Orbital in the Latugara system.

The campaign has been provisionally scheduled to run for four weeks from the 15th of September 3302, but the Latugara PLC has said it will run the campaign until its targets are met.


* Community Goal: The Fight for Thoreau Orbital
Federal intelligence operatives have uncovered an Imperial plot to destabilise the Thoreau Orbital outpost in Obotrima. The starport is a major manufacturing centre for autonomous defence drones, more commonly known as skimmers.

According to a leaked report, the Imperial organisation Chimechilo Empire League plans to disrupt skimmer production at Thoreau Orbital by flooding it with explosives. The Chimechilo Empire League has asked Imperial pilots to support the operation by delivering explosives to Thoreau Orbital.

To counter this threat, the Obotrima Organisation has asked Federation-aligned pilots to deliver skimmer components and robotics to the outpost in order to manufacture new skimmers.

Both operations are scheduled to run for one week from the 15th of September 3302.


* Galactic News: Imperial Operation Succeeds
The Xuangu Crimson Major Network has announced that the Imperial operation to recover valuable intelligence from Federal convoys in the Mu Koji system has been a success.

But although the Empire achieved its primary goal, victory came at a cost. Independent correspondents, reporting from Mu Koji, have confirmed that the Empire lost considerably more ships than the Federation.

In the wake of the victory, a spokesperson for Xuangu Crimson Major Network thanked those who supported the campaign. Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Aksyonov Hub in Mu Koji.

* Galactic News: Kahina Loren Implicated in Patreus Assassination Attempt
Sources close to the Imperial Senate have released a statement indicating that Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, erstwhile senator of the Prism system, has been charged in connection with the attempted assassination of Admiral Denton Patreus.

Prior to this development, Lady Kahina had not been heard from since mid 3301. Details of her recent activities are shrouded in mystery, although under the alias Commander Salom\u00e9 she has been linked to various revolutionary organisations, including the Children of Raxxla, the Phoenix Group, the Dark Wheel and now Emperor's Dawn.

After Lady Kahina went missing in the Cemiess system last month, the Children of Raxxla attempted to destabilise the system's economy to force system authorities to reveal her whereabouts.

\Her intentions are clear,\ said a reporter for The Imperial Citizen. \She hates Patreus for his takeover of the Prism system \u2013 which I might point out was entirely legal \u2013 and harbours ridiculous delusions of becoming Emperor. She's been sowing seeds of discontent everywhere she goes. As we reported last month, she is dangerously unstable and an irresponsible warmonger. Now that she's been caught, she should be dealt with harshly. The same applies to the factions loyal to her.\

Princess Aisling Duval also addressed the arrest, saying: \I was always suspicious about her. Now her true colours have been revealed. I hope she receives a just punishment for her atrocious crimes. I wouldn't be surprised to discover she was behind the instability of the past year. My thanks go to our loyal Imperial security services for their diligence.\

Lady Kahina has reportedly been moved to the Achenar system to await trial.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Order of Ethgreze

Zeessze Clan

Yimanbin Industries

Kitche Citizens' Forum

LHS 1110 Patron's Principles

Stafkarl Stakeholders

New Belenja Defence Party

HIP 296 Purple Bridge Systems

Velnians Revolutionary Party

Lalande 10797 Comms Holdings

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Kraurno Blue Brothers

Kamadhenu Netcoms Corporation

Salibi Mafia

Namniez Free

Ross 209 Fortune Organisation

Revolutionary 5 G. Apodis Values Party

Yuror Crimson Drug Empire

Movement for Pipi Free

Independent HR 8526 for Equality

Co-operative of HIP 113113

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Galactic News: Halsey Shares Her Vision
Since leaving the Clearwater psychiatric centre in July, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has maintained a relatively low profile. But now the former leader has broken her silence to share news of \a compelling vision\ with the galactic community.

In a public address at Gotham Park in the Alioth system, Halsey described the nature of her vision:

\I saw a place of extraordinary beauty. A paradise. It was truly wonderful.\

\This was no dream \u2013 it was a glimpse of something very real.\

 \We must find this place. It could be our future.\

Halsey's peculiar statement will no doubt disappoint those who believed she had made a full psychological recovery.

* Community Goal: Federation Appeals for Exploration Data
The Federation has issued a public appeal for exploration data as part of its ongoing operation in the Pleiades Nebula. The appeal is being coordinated by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which released the following statement to the media:

\Given the recent discovery of possible non-human wreckage in the Pleiades, it is essential that we have comprehensive and up-to-date information on the entire region. We are therefore asking pilots to sweep the Pleiades and deliver any resultant exploration data to Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system. Commanders who contribute to this initiative will be generously rewarded.\

The announcement comes in the midst of animated debate over recent Federal and Imperial action in the Pleiades.

The campaign begins on the 22nd of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: New Imperial Base in Pleiades Sector Ab-W B2-4
The Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been tasked with constructing a new forward operating base in the Pleiades Sector Ab-W B2-4 system on behalf of the Empire. The new outpost will support the Empire's ongoing operations in the Pleiades Nebula.

A spokesperson for the Merope Expeditionary Fleet released a statement:

\I realise some might perceive this as an attempt to assert Imperial dominion over the Pleiades Nebula, but establishing a strong military presence in the Pleiades is the only way we can oppose Federal attempts to establish a monopoly on meta-alloys.\

In support of this initiative, the Merope Expeditionary Fleet has placed an open order for Power Generators, Tantalum and Auto Fabricators, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to its base of operations at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.

The campaign begins on the 22nd of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Services Suspended at Thoreau Orbital
Personnel at Thoreau Orbital in the Obotrima system have been forced to suspend various services \u2013 a direct result of an Imperial campaign to destabilise the starport by flooding it with explosives.

As a major manufacturing centre for autonomous defence drones, more commonly known as skimmers, the station was considered a priority target by the Empire.

A member of startport personnel, who chose to remain anonymous, said:

\The Federal Navy knew this attack was coming, but they did nothing. The independent pilots who delivered skimmer components did a great job, but without military support, how could they hope to foil the Empire's plan? Now Thoreau Orbital is in dire shape. Who knows how long it'll be before things are back to normal.\

* Galactic News: Chairman of MetaDrive Inc. Passes Away
Sad news from the Chi Orionis system this morning with reports that Femi Dakarai, chairman of the hyperdrive-research company MetaDrive Inc., has passed away following a short illness.

Dakarai was taken ill last week after working tirelessly to secure financial backing for the company. Board members reported that he was working long hours and had been showing signs of stress for several months. An assessment of MetaDrive Inc. by an independent auditing firm appears to have been the final straw.

\We should have acted sooner, but we were working extremely hard,\ said Rosaline Merden, company secretary. \With the company set to deliver on some very exciting technology in the coming year, it's particularly tragic. We will carry on in his memory.\

Board members were quick to pay their respects, and according to unofficial sources have made a generous payment to the Dakarai family on behalf of MetaDrive Inc.

In related news, Raan Corsen, a junior employee of MetaDrive Inc., was recently suspended from the company after auditors detected account irregularities. Security forces in the Chi Orionis system, recently brought under the control of the Earth Defense Fleet, have asked the public to report any sightings of Corsen.

MetaDrive Inc. has become something of a poster child for the depression currently affecting stock markets. Economic forecasts remain gloomy, with little prospect of improvement on the horizon.

* Galactic News: Imperial Appeal Comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Merope Expeditionary Fleet has announced that its appeal for construction materials was enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of independent pilots responded to the organisation's request, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Obsidian Orbital, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to construct a new Imperial operating base in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system.

The spokesperson released a statement.

\I know there are some who decry the Empire for its part in this conflict. They believe that if we simply walked away, the conflict would end. But sometimes the only way to achieve peace is by opposing the tyrannical.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Galactic News: Enthusiastic Response to Federal Appeal
A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has announced that its appeal for exploration data was enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by sweeping the Pleiades Nebula and delivering the resultant astronomical data to Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.

The organisation's spokesperson released the following statement:

\The Federation extends its gratitude to those who supported this operation. If there are other crash sites like the one discovered in AB-W B2-4, it is imperative that we know. That's why this data is so important.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.


* Community Goal: Aid for the Mu Koji Refugees
Earlier this month, the Mu Koji system was engulfed in the ongoing conflict between the Empire and the Federation, as the superpowers staged rival operations to secure enemy intelligence.

Although the battle only lasted a few days, the collateral damage was severe, resulting in the displacement of thousands of civilians. System authorities have responded by establishing a refugee centre at the Bujold Enterprise starport, but have found themselves unable to provide the many refugees with medicine and shelter.

The Kalana Independents have therefore offered to fund a coordinated relief effort. The organisation has placed an open order for basic medicines and evacuation shelters, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Bujold Enterprise in the Kalana system.

The campaign begins on the 29th of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Imperial Prima Donnas Flash their Claws
Princess Aisling Duval has clashed with former Imperial senator Lady Kahina Loren in an impromptu debate organised by The Imperial Citizen. Unbeknownst to either Princess Duval or Lady Kahina, parts of the altercation were broadcast live.

Princess Duval was heard to say: \You really thought you could swan in here from your provincial little system and get away with murder? You even had designs on being Emperor. Have you any idea how ridiculous you look?\

\I'm not the one wearing a stupid wig,\ Loren retorted.

\You're finished,\ said Princess Duval. \Everyone knows you're guilty. You'll be stripped of your rank and title, and no fancy speech can save you!\

\At least I don't need someone to write my speeches for me,\ Loren replied. \Anyone with half a brain can see this is a set up. Ask yourself this \u2013 who has the most to gain from this ridiculous charade?\

\Nice try. You'll pay for what you've done \u2013 Patreus will see to that. I know you hate him!\

\Oh, I despise the man,\ said Loren, \but if I wanted him dead, he'd be dead.\

Lady Kahina Loren's trial will take place in two weeks' time.


* Galactic News: The Martian Relic
The discovery of mysterious wreckage in the Pleiades Nebula has rekindled interest in the so-called Martian Relic, an object discovered beneath the surface of Mars over one thousand years ago.

Very little is known about the Relic except that it was discovered in 2280 and is relatively small, measuring no more than a few centimetres square. Indeed, there is so little concrete information in the public sphere that some have questioned the Relic's very existence. But leaked Federal records confirm that the object, which was sequestered by the Federal government shortly after its discovery, is very real.

The discovery of the Unknown Artefacts, Unknown Probes and the mysterious wreckage in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system has prompted many to wonder anew at the Relic's origin.  Naturally, some have speculated that it could be a Thargoid artefact, but with access to the Relic restricted, this theory can be neither proved nor disproved.

Only one thing is for sure \u2013 until the Federal government decides to release information into the public domain, we have little option but to speculate.

Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Acrimony on Achenar
An anonymous source has indicated that the scandal surrounding former senator Kahina Tijani Loren has awoken latent animosity within the Imperial powerbase.

The source claims that recent events have brought the affairs of Admiral Denton Patreus, Princess Aisling Duval and even Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval into the spotlight, and that much intrigue and politicking is taking place behind closed doors.

Princess Duval, following an embarrassing story from The Imperial Citizen, said: \Isn't it interesting that this happens just as a crisis is developing on our borders? While the media is preoccupied with that psychopathic Loren woman, the real stories are being ignored!\

Neither Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval nor Admiral Denton Patreus deigned to comment on the matter.


* Galactic News: Curious Transmission Partially Decoded
In early August, an antique Cobra Mk III was interred at the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard. Shortly before the ship was laid to rest, a beacon aboard the vessel transmitted a repeating sequence of curious characters.

The sequence was picked up by several listening and relay posts in the Tionisla system, and it has now been determined that it contains content obscured with an unknown encryption. The encrypted data is followed by an apparently meaningless clear-text phrase: 'The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero.'

Intelligence services within the Alliance, Empire and Federation are said to be investigating the message, but no official statements have yet been made. Both the sender and intended recipient of the message remain a mystery.


* Freelance Report: Basking for Refugees
A group of well-connected Imperial Commanders has descended on the Kalana system carrying medicines and evacuation shelters. The loosely organized 'Cutter Club', as the group calls itself, has pledged to meet the needs of the Mu Koji refugees.

The Cutter Club has also organised a fundraising event in support of various other charitable efforts. The event, Basking for Refugees, will be streamed from Moore Prospect on the 2nd of October 3302 at 22:00 galactic standard time. The main event will feature daredevil SRV jumps over rows of Imperial Cutters. The public is invited to participate in the event, and to consider supporting a charity of their choice.

Commander PeachSlicesV summed up the event:

\War creates significant numbers of displaced, vulnerable and needy people. Whatever you can give will improve their lives. Who knows \u2013 one day they might save yours.\

* Galactic News: Federal Appeal Comes to an End
The Federation has announced that its campaign to construct a new outpost in the Maia system has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal for construction materials by delivering auto fabricators, titanium, and power generators to Obsidian Orbital in Maia.

A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which coordinated the campaign, released a brief statement:

\The potential value of the meta-alloys \u2013 to say nothing of the barnacles themselves \u2013 is enormous, and it is essential that Imperial efforts to control them be opposed. This new outpost will help us achieve that aim.\

\I would like to personally thank those who supported this initiative. Remember \u2013 the stars shine brightest on the Federation.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.

* Galactic News: Exploration or Surveillance?
A spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation has revealed that the mega-corporation has deployed hundreds of deep-space probes and signalling technologies throughout the galaxy.

The spokesperson said: \Sending pilots into the void is fraught with danger. These probes can go further and faster than a human pilot, at much reduced cost and with, I daresay, more reliability. We've been working closely with the Mars High Astrocartography department on the probes' design.\

\Human pilots are interested in sightseeing, chasing myths and 'making their mark' on the galactic stage. They get sidetracked. Our probes are immune to such distractions. At present, galactic exploration is conducted in a sporadic and improvisational way. Soon we will have far better coverage of the galaxy.\

One independent pilot, who opted to remain anonymous, said: \There's something odd about this. I'd hazard a guess these probes have self-defence capabilities. I'll be giving them a wide berth.\

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

LHS 3437 Coalition

LHS 293 Corp.

LHS 1393 Services

Workers of Nebtete Resistance

Yawa Commodities

Partnership of Li Cha

Pleiades Resource Enterprise

Independents of Lie Yupik

Black Omega

Kacomam Empire Group

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.

Pleiades Resource Enterprise

Independents of Lie Yupik

Black Omega

Kacomam Empire Group

LHS 411 Advanced Incorporated\t

Paeling Blue Life and Co

Vadimo Patrons of Law

Browncoat Uprising

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Labour of 64 Arietis

Law Party of Umaitis

Partnership of HIP 19147

Nuevo Orden de Comandantes Imperiales

CD-87 103 Imperial Society

* Galactic News: Anti-Piracy Campaign Concludes
Authorities in Slink's Eye have announced that the operation to clear the system of pirates has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the operation, taking to their ships to eliminate the agitators operating in the system, and providing local security forces with deliveries of reactive armour.

Jaylon Hart, head of local security, thanked those who supported the initiative.

\There are some damn good pilots in my team, but we just don't have the resources to counter offensives of this scale. By providing us with combat support and much-needed supplies, the galactic community played an essential role in protecting the people of Slink's Eye. We're hugely grateful to both the public and the Revolutionary Slink's Eye Liberals.\

Rewards for those who contributed to the operation can now be collected from Kelleam Ring.


* Community Goal: The Gathering
Each year, the Annual Galactic Games Organisation holds an elaborate gaming tournament known as the Gathering, enticing the rich and famous to a chosen system for a week-long party.

This year's event will take place at the Norman \u2013 Mavis's Bingo Palace starport in the Aramzahd system, chosen for its proximity to the lush planet of Guardinia. In addition to the games, there will be historical flight displays and presentations from many of the galaxy's premier ship manufacturers. System authorities have welcomed the event, which is expected to attract thousands of guests and bring in millions of credits.

In anticipation of the event, the Aramzahd Empire Party has placed an open order for Centauri Mega Gin, Giant Irukama Snails, Lavian Brandy, Tanmark Tranquil Tea and Witchhaul Kobe Beef. Pilots who deliver these commodities to Norman - Mavis's Bingo Palace in the Aramzahd system will be generously rewarded. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Aramzahd, to ensure the safety of those attending the event.

The campaign begins on the 13th October 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Alliance Outpost in the California Nebula
Last week, the Alliance deployed a flotilla to the California Sector BA-A E6 system in the California Nebula. The act proved controversial, prompting accusations that the Alliance was attempting to lay claim to the organic structures on California Sector BA-A E6 4 of the California Sector BA-A E6 system.

In the wake of this development, the Alliance has announced plans to construct a new outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4. According to an Alliance spokesperson, the station will serve as \a centre for scientific study, supporting our ongoing research into the organic structures and meta-alloys\.

In support of this initiative, the Alliance has placed an open order for geological equipment, hazardous-environment suits and pesticides. 160 SOAR, which is coordinating the appeal, has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.

The campaign begins on the 13th of October 3302 and will run for two weeks. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Colonia Appeal Concludes
It has been four weeks since the Latugara PLC announced plans to establish a series of outposts between the burgeoning Colonia Nebula community and the core of human-inhabited space.

Since then, the galactic community has delivered huge quantities of materials to Love Orbital for use in the construction.

A spokesperson for the Latugara PLC released a statement, thanking those who contributed to the campaign:

\We are hugely grateful to the many Commanders who supported this initiative. You have done a great deal to facilitate travel to and from the nascent Colonia community. Construction of the new outposts is expected to begin within the next few weeks.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Love Orbital in the Latugara system.

* Galactic News: Kahina Loren Stripped of her Rank
Kahina Tijani Loren has been stripped of the rank of senator for delegating her responsibilities in respect of the Prism system to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney in 3301.

An aide for Admiral Denton Patreus said: \Loren gave up her senatorial responsibilities, so it's unreasonable that she continue to be protected by the title. Frankly, she shouldn't be described as a 'lady', either, but we will let the courts make that determination.\

This means Loren will now be tried based on the laws of her nominated home system, which is of course the Prism system. Loren has been moved from Achenar and is presumed to be en route to Prism, under guard.

While Prism remains under the supervision of Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, it is heavily exploited by Admiral Patreus. Patreus's aide said: \Those without a proper appreciation of due process might believe there is a conflict of interest, given Admiral Patreus's influence in Prism, but we can ensure the galactic community that Imperial law will be followed to the letter.\


* Galactic News: Location of Colonia Outposts Announced
Latugara PLC, which recently launched a successful campaign to establish a series of outposts between the Colonia Nebula and the core systems, has announced where the new outposts will be built. The name of each outpost has also been revealed.

Construction is expected to begin within the next few weeks.


* Freelance Report: The Cassiopeia Expedition
The Earth Expeditionary Fleet has announced plans to mount a bold expedition beyond the Perseus Arm to find two stellar objects in the Cassiopeia constellation first noted by Earth astronomers in the distant past.

\The Cassiopeia Project differs from other expeditions,\ said Commander Finn McMillan. \We will attempt to locate two supernova remnants, which have yet to be found despite numerous attempts from independent explorers. Our targets are Cassiopeia A and Tycho's Star.\

\This is not space tourism. The expedition to Cassiopeia A will take us into an area of space referred to as the Formidine Rift, which before the advent of the frame shift drive had a reputation as a kind of Bermuda Triangle. Few who venture into the Rift return to tell the tale.\

The expedition is expected to depart from Chi Orionis in the first week of November 3302.

* Community Goal: Strengthening the Colonia Community
The Colonia Council, the governing body of the Colonia system, has launched a campaign to expand infrastructure and manufacturing facilities in the region. The initiative is intended to support future colonisation of the Colonia Nebula, and address the needs of the growing Colonia community.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Council elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

\Colonia is expanding rapidly, and with an official colonisation initiative due to start soon, we need to make sure we can meet our citizens' needs.\

\The colony has received a lot of support from the galactic community, but if it's going to become a fully fledged society, we need proper infrastructure.\

* Galactic News: Patreus Rails against London Treaty
Commentators have reacted with surprise and dismay to a speech from Admiral Denton Patreus at a military tattoo on Achenar, in which he spoke in strident tones about the London Treaty. The treaty, established in 3278, imposes limits on capital-ship construction in order to prevent possible arms races.

\This treaty was foisted on us by overzealous Federal lawyers,\ said Patreus. \Now it is used to limit our ability to defend ourselves. This I cannot accept.\

\I am proud to announce that henceforth the Empire will build as many ships as it needs, treaty restrictions be damned!\

Federal representatives were quick to denounce Patreus's proposal, saying it would have severe repercussions. But stock markets in the core systems reacted favourably to the news, with reports indicating that the Empire had already secured several construction contracts.

Admiral Patreus will soon depart for the Prism system to oversee the trial of Kahina Loren.


* Freelance Report: The SHEPARD Mission
In honour of Alan Shepard, the second human being to enter space, a group of independent pilots has announced a galactic endurance expedition.

The SHEPARD Mission will consist of five legs covering 37 waypoints and 12 base camps in the Centaurus Reach, the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, the Styx and the galactic core. The mission will also include an SRV planetary-circumnavigation endurance race and a climb to the galactic ceiling using newly discovered Pulsar-FSD boost technology.

Still accepting pilots, SHEPARD will last six months and depart from the Sol system on the 5th of November 3302.

* Galactic News: MetaDrive Acquired by Sirius Corporation
Board members of MetaDrive Inc. today announced the sale of MetaDrive Inc. to the Sirius Corporation. Rosaline Merden, acting Chair of MetaDrive, was clearly pleased with the outcome. At a press conference, she said:

\The board of MetaDrive wholeheartedly welcomes the security this acquisition brings. As part of the Sirius Corporation, the MetaDrive brand will continue to go from strength to strength.\

Reporters asked about the ongoing audit of MetaDrive, and also the fate of former employee Raan Corsen, who was reported missing a couple of weeks ago.

\The audit has been successfully completed and all assets are in the hands of Sirius Corporation,\ said Merden. \Raan Corsen's employment was terminated prior to the takeover.\

Merden was challenged by a representative of the Earth Defence Fleet, who alleged that Raan Corsen had in fact fled from Sirius security forces and been killed in the Alioth system.

\Mr Corsen's business in the Alioth system was his own,\ said Merden. \It has nothing to do with the Sirius Corporation.\

The press conference closed with outstanding questions, but reporters managed to get a final word from Commander MoonWeb of the Earth Defence Fleet.

\According to our intel, Corsen was pursued before crash-landing on a planet in the Alioth system. This was observed by Commander Ashley Wilkinson, a Canonn representative working with the Earth Defence Fleet.\

\The specifics surrounding Corsen's demise are not known, but we have a transcript of his final transmission that points a finger squarely at the Sirius Corporation.\

* Galactic News: Loren Trial Begins
The trial of Lady Kahina Tijani Loren has begun at the Prism Hall of Justice.

Earlier this week, several flotillas of heavily armed ships arrived in the Prism system. The vessels docked at the Hiram's Anchorage starport amid tight security enforced by Imperial forces and local organisation Loren's Legion, which controls the Prism system.

Much of Hiram's Anchorage has been off limits to civilians during the week because of fears that Loren's presence, and that of Admiral Denton Patreus, would lead to renewed instability. Loren's return to her home system is controversial in itself, as she has not been there since she ceded executive power to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney.

Loren was briefly seen in conversation with Ambassador Delaney, who embraced Loren before she was moved to a secure holding area. Admiral Patreus arrived a few hours later. Media representatives have not been allowed to speak to either Loren or Patreus, and it is understood that the trial will be conducted behind closed doors.

The mood in Prism is sombre. Support for Loren is muted, with few willing to publically support her ahead of the trial. But it is clear there is little enthusiasm for Admiral Patreus, either.

* Galactic News: Palin Announces Development
Professor Ishmael Palin, founder and former director of the Palin Institute, has released a statement concerning his ongoing research into meta-alloys.

\I have discovered previously unidentified properties that could make the meta-alloys ideally suited to the development of robust new materials \u2013 materials that could be used to great effect in combat starships.\

\My research is still at an early stage and I am far from developing a working prototype, but the early signs are very encouraging. This discovery could herald a major step forward in the development of defensive technologies.\

Professor Palin has been researching meta-alloys from his personal research base on Maia A 3 a since he resigned from the Palin Institute in April. He closed his statement with a promise to share his progress with the galactic community.


* Galactic News: Federation Blockades Maia A 3 a
Independent reports from the Maia system indicate that a Farragut-class Battlecruiser has taken up position over Maia A 3 a, not far from the personal research base of Professor Ishmael Palin. The Federal vessel is apparently redirecting pilots who stray too close to the site.

The news comes only a day after Professor Palin announced a breakthrough in his research into meta-alloys.

The purpose of the deployment is not immediately apparent, but rival political powers have been quick to condemn the act. Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon described it as \an egregious act of oppression\ while Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said, \The Federation has an obligation to immediately curtail any restriction of Professor Palin's personal freedoms.\

Attempts to contact Professor Palin have been unsuccessful.


* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the 160 SOAR has announced that the Alliance appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion.

Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Tshang City, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to construct an outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4.

In a statement, the spokesperson said:

\We are immeasurably grateful to the galactic community for its support. The outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4 will serve as a base for research into the barnacles, allowing us to further our understanding of these fascinating structures. Construction will begin in a matter of weeks.\

But the campaign has not been without controversy, with some asserting that the outpost represents an attempt to claim ownership of the organic structures on California Sector BA-A E6 4.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.


* Galactic News: Walter Waldo Appeal Concludes
A spokesperson for Gyvatices Crimson Advanced Holdings has announced that its appeal for fish and coffee was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Walter Dock in the Gyvatices system. The commodities will be used in a special fish and coffee festival to honour the late entrepreneur Walter Waldo.

Gyvatices Crimson Advanced Holdings has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Walter Dock in the Gyvatices system.


* Community Goal: Trouble in Maia
Earlier this month, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise entered Maia and rapidly started cementing its presence in the system. In response, the Ant Hill Mob \u2013 Maia's current controlling faction \u2013 has launched an offensive against Pleiades Resource Enterprise.

With the Federation having recently stationed a Farragut-class Battlecruiser at Maia A 3 a, there is speculation that the appearance of Pleiades Resource Enterprise represents an effort to bring Maia under Federal control.

A spokesperson for the Ant Hill Mob gave a brief statement:

\The Pleiades Resource Enterprise is clearly trying to pave the way for a full Federal takeover of the system. Well, if they want Maia, they're going to have to fight for it.\

The Ant Hill Mob has appealed to the galaxy's Imperial pilots for help, promising to generously reward those who support their operation. The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has issued a similar request to Federal pilots.

Both organisations have set out week-long operations, which are scheduled to run from the 27th of October 3302.


* Galactic News: Yuri Grom Takes the Stage
The Dangerous Games dominated headlines earlier this year, as some of galaxy's most powerful minor factions took part in a brutal battle for supremacy.

After weeks of fierce competition involving hundreds of independent pilots, it was the EG Pilots who emerged victorious. Having spent the intervening months consolidating their assets, the EG Pilots are now ready to enter the galactic stage. Consequently, the temporary restriction on preparatory activity in systems within 30 light years of the Clayakarma, Nauo, Gyhldekala, Boga and Kpaniya systems \u2013 imposed by the United Research Council partly to allow the EG Pilots an opportunity to secure their position \u2013 has now been lifted.

Like all powers, the organisation will seek the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, who will play a central role in its fate.

Very little is known about the group's leader, Yuri Grom, although he is understood to have started his career in the Federal Navy, reaching the rank of Admiral before parting with the Federation and entering politics. Following a brief conflict in the Euryale system, in which Grom clashed with his former Federal allies, the ex-admiral emerged as the leader of his own independent power.

Propaganda distributed by the EG Pilots offers a succinct description of Grom:

\Yuri is idolized by his supporters and respected throughout his controlled systems. His support among the populace is absolute, his dominion unshakable.\

One thing is for sure \u2013 Grom's career, and the future of the EG Pilots, promises to be anything but boring.


* Galactic News: Weekly Democracy Report

* Galactic News: Kahina Loren Found Guilty
Today, an announcement was made outside the Prism Hall of Justice confirming that Kahina Tijani Loren had been found guilty of the attempted assassination of Admiral Denton Patreus. The announcement was met with cries of dismay from a crowd of Loren's supporters, who had turned out to hear the verdict.

\Ms Loren has been sentenced to life imprisonment at Koontz Asylum in the Daibo system,\ said a court clerk.

A leaked recording from the press room showed Loren talking with two unidentified men. Their conversation ran as follows:

\And what do you want in return for your...favour?\ one man asked.

\Patreus's head on a platter,\ responded Loren.

Having already been stripped of the title of 'senator', Loren's status as a Lady of the Empire was similarly revoked. She was taken to a secure holding facility after the verdict was announced.

Princess Aisling Duval spoke to The Imperial Citizen about the trial:

\The woman is clearly deranged. She tried to kill Patreus, but justice has been served. The galaxy is now a safer place.\

Admiral Denton Patreus, emerging from the courtroom, smiled and said: \They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind.\

Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, administrator of the Prism system, spoke briefly to The Imperial Herald.

\We cannot deny the verdict, but we are dismayed by the outcome. We remain convinced that Kahina Loren is innocent. We will leave no stone unturned in our search for the truth.\

Meanwhile, an anonymous source affiliated with the Imperial justice system said: \It's a de facto death sentence. No one returns from Koontz Asylum.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report
This report presents the latest data on conflict among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience a civil war:

HIP 94905 Power Partners

Nagii Autocracy

Law Party of LHS 3776

LHS 3776 Co-operative

Freedom Party of Sirius

CD-63 201 Empire Pact

United Redoneangi Autocracy

United Teaka First

Values Party of BD+26 2184

Sokariang Empire League

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

G 165-13 Commodities

Manian Co-op

Partnership of Draualang

Barons of Ba Nari

Andhi Liberals

NLTT 8653 Empire Assembly

Menero Kimi Empire Group

Alioth Independents

BD+03 515 Ltd

Haritana Dynamic Group

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Andhi Liberals

Kuo Zhi Partnership

Regulatory State of Kausan

1 G. Caeli Empire League

Earth Defense Fleet

Syndicate of Tiburi He

Justice Party of Anekaliti

Values Party of BD+43 2989

HIP 27371 Empire League

Values Party of Gliese 9204

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Samen Crimson General Services

Munshin Allied PLC

Union of 6 Ceti Free

Narantan Nationals

Tz'utuls Progressive Party

Wolf 1051 State Industry

LTT 9810 Citizens' Forum

Workers of Kakas Free

Wei Chang Empire League

V857 Centauri Coalition

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Galactic News: Ancient Ruins Discovered
Four days ago, the galaxy was stunned by news that mysterious ruins had been discovered in the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system.

The discovery was made by an independent pilot known by the callsign 'xdeath'. Once the find was made public, pilots from across the galaxy flocked to investigate the site.

Although a formal survey of the ruins has not yet been conducted, speculation is rife that they are of non-human origin. Images of the site, which show mysterious structures and a series of complex earthworks, appear to support this hypothesis.

The discovery of the ruins is only one of a number of remarkable finds made over the past few years. The Unknown Artefacts, Unknown Probes, the so-called organic structures and the crash site in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system have piqued the curiosity of the entire galactic community. But the relationship between these discoveries \u2013 if any \u2013 has yet to be determined.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Eravate Life Services

LTT 700 Silver Federal Exchange

Dragons of Tepertsi

Liberty Party of Tau Ceti

LFT 1834 Corp.

Clan of LHS 1110

Independents of IL Aquarii

LFT 133 Exchange

Movement for Tetek Future

Textovices Universal Corp.

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

E.X.O

Progressive Party of Bolg

Independent Guan Zaihe League

Co-op of Mbokokumal

Integrated Shu Babassi

Revolutionary 5 G. Apodis Values Party

Hojin Blue Dragons

Dukes of LTT 2893

Sorbacoc Society

Namniez Free

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.


* Freelance Report: Fungi Discovered on Airless Worlds
The Colonia Citizens Network has reported that fungal growths have been discovered on the airless world of Colonia 3 C A.

There appear to be four distinct species, which grow on silicate geysers. Mycologist Dr James Morel had this to say about the discovery:

\Based on the visual telemetry, I can say the shelf and puffball-like specimens fall under the basidiomycota phyla of fungi. The other two cannot be identified without studying physical samples.\

\I urge explorers to handle the specimens with care, and to follow basic hazardous-material handing protocol. We don't know how these species might interact with living tissue.\

The first data on the fungus was recorded by Commander Alesia of the Pilots Federation.

Julian McCoy of the Colonia Citizens Network Alien Research Division issued the following statement:

\The discovery of life, particularly in a remote region like the Colonia Nebula, is a remarkable achievement. I believe this find places new emphasis on the importance of colonization and expanding human knowledge of the galaxy.\

* Freelance Report: Irresponsible Independents Ransack Ruins
Following the discovery of ancient ruins on planet 1 B of Synuefe XR-H d11-102, hundreds of independent pilots have plotted a course to the system. Many scientifically-minded Commanders have begun the painstaking task of deciphering the secrets of the ruins.

Unfortunately, the cataloguing and excavation has been disrupted by piracy, profiteers and general pandemonium.

Jeremy Grant, an archaeologist who has been working at the site for several days, expressed concern at the prevailing conditions:

\It's not safe out here. The ruins have been significantly damaged by SRV racing. Priceless artefacts have been shattered and weapons fire has scarred several obelisks, destroying markings.\

\Independent pilots have made a lot of noise about the Empire and Federation cordoning off major research sites, but if this is an indication of how independents treat sites of value, perhaps the superpowers are doing the right thing.\

* Galactic News: Pleiades Resource Enterprise Victorious
Recent reports from Maia indicate that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has successfully overcome resistance from the Ant Hill Mob to gain a foothold in the system.

A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise released a brief statement:

\The Ant Hill Mob believes our expansion into Maia was orchestrated by Federal officials, but I think they're just looking for a way of explaining their defeat. In war, it's the stronger side that wins. Simple as that. We may be aligned with the Federation, but we were acting on our own behalf.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Maia Point in the Maia system.

* Galactic News: Colonia Council Initiative Concludes
The Colonia Council has announced that its appeal for palladium was a resounding success, with hundreds of pilots delivering materials to Jaques Station in response to the request. The materials will be used to support further colonisation of the Colonia Nebula, and address the needs of the growing Colonia community.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:

\This material will help us bolster infrastructure in the system, and support the forthcoming colonisation programme. But more than that, it will help us lay the foundations of a better, brighter future.\

\The future is here, and its name is Colonia.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Jaques Station in the Colonia system.


* Community Goal: Mysterious Organisation Releases Message
In November last year, a mysterious organisation known as Revolution Incorporated placed an open order for explosives in commemoration of the Gunpowder Plot \u2013 a historic incident dating from Earth's distant past.

The request attracted the attention of security officials who feared it might presage a terrorist attack, but ultimately no such attack took place. It is now believed that if the group did have nefarious intent, its plans were foiled.

But despite this apparent setback, the organisation itself has endured, having issued the following message to media outlets and social networks throughout the galaxy:

\Last time, they stopped us. This time, they will not. The powers-that-be must accept their fate, and pay the price for their misdeeds.\

\They will be taught a lesson in power \u2013 the power of the people.\

\If you are a true believer, be at the following location at 16.05 UTC on the 5th of November 3302.\

\Novas A 6, Novas system.\

Security forces in the Novas system have urged the public to ignore the message.


* Community Goal: Appeal for Ancient Data
Since the mysterious ruins in the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system were discovered last week, the site has become a hotbed of activity, with hundreds of explorers attempting to uncover the ruins' secrets.

Now the engineer Ram Tah has announced plans to conduct a comprehensive research programme with the aim of learning more about the site.

At a press event, Ram Tah made the following statement:

\The discovery of the Synuefe ruins is hugely significant, and the site is unquestionably worthy of further study. Fortunately, United Meene Labour has graciously agreed to fund a comprehensive research project.\

\I am therefore in the privileged position of being able to devote myself to studying data from the site. It is my hope that by decoding this data, we can learn more about the civilisation responsible for the ruins.\

\Having conducted a preliminary survey of the site, I have determined that Pattern Delta Obelisk Data would of great value at this stage.\

United Meene Labour has promised to reward pilots who bring Pattern Delta Obelisk Data from the Synuefe ruins to Felice Dock in the Meene system. The campaign begins on the 3rd of November 3302 and will run for two weeks.

Following accusations of recklessness from archaeologist Jeremy Grant, noted SRV racer Stanley Steamer has released the following statement:

\Has Grant actually seen the site? It's already a pile of rubble! And we believe that rubble is the remains of an ancient racetrack. So by racing around it, we're actually honouring the memory of those who built it.\

\If one of those highfalutin science nerds can definitively prove I'm wrong, I'll stop driving. But until then, don't go insulting us with your superpower rhetoric, professor!\

* Galactic News: Patreus's Flagship Attacked
Eyewitness reports from the Eotienses system indicate that an attack has taken place on Admiral Denton Patreus' flagship, the INV Imperial Freedom. The Majestic-class Interdictor was heavily damaged in the altercation and was ignominiously forced to withdraw from the field of combat.

An organisation known as the Children of Raxxla has claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement, the organisation said it had been '\backed into a corner\ after diplomatic entreaties regarding Kahina Loren \u2013 whom it referred to as Salom\u00e9 \u2013 had gone unanswered.

The attack appears to have been a response to the 'guilty' verdict passed on Loren last week, and based on the assumption that she was aboard the INV Imperial Freedom. Vessels bearing Children of Raxxla markings were witnessed intercepting escape pods ejected from the beleaguered Interdictor.

The Children of Raxxla spokesperson said the group \harboured no ill will towards Patreus\ and that \the guilty parties continue to lurk in the shadows\.

Imperial security forces have condemned the attack, saying:

\This group has shown its true colours. Kahina Loren was known for inciting violence, and these terrorists are clearly intent on continuing her legacy.\

The damage to the INV Imperial Freedom represents a blow to Admiral Patreus' ambitions to strengthen the Imperial fleet, exposing these battleships' vulnerability to attacks from well-organised independent forces.

* Freelance Report: The Christmas Carriers Convoy
The Colonia Citizens Network has invited the galactic community to support Colonia by delivering much-needed food and equipment to the region and by transporting new settlers, as part of what is set to be one of the largest freight convoys in human history.

The Christmas Carriers Convoy will depart on the 2nd of December 3302, stopping at each outpost on the so-called Colonia highway, and arrive in Colonia in the first week of January. So far, nearly 150 pilots have signed up.

The Earth Defense Fleet, the 9th Legion, the Iridium Wing, SEPP and the Prismatic Imperium have all pledged pilots to protect the freighters for the duration of the trip.

Dalilah William, a citizen of Colonia Hub, said:

\We need more of the essentials that those in the core systems take for granted, which is why we're calling on traders and haulers to join the Christmas Carriers Convoy, and appealing to combat pilots to protect them.\

* Galactic News: Second Mysterious Wreck Discovered
A shipwreck bearing strong similarities to that recently found in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 has been discovered in the HIP 17862 system.

The wreck was found by one Commander Denneb on the airless planetoid 6 C A.

Images of the site, shared by the many independent explorers and scientists who flocked to investigate it, show an unconventional-looking vessel with a distinctly organic quality. Like the shipwreck found in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4, the wreckage encompasses a number of vaguely wing-like elements roughly arranged around an octagonal core.

The discovery has stimulated considerable debate among scientists and xenobiologists. So far, as with the previous shipwreck, no concrete information about the vessel's origin has emerged.

Commentators have observed that the ship bears no apparent signs of weapons damage, and that the concentrated debris field suggests the vessel was still intact when it hit the planet's surface.

* Freelance Report: Hapless Explorer Returns Home
A number of newsfeeds have reported that amateur explorer Commander Lewis has finally returned to human-inhabited space. After following the Distant Worlds Expedition into the void, the unfortunate traveller found himself alone in a damaged Asp Scout some 65,000 light years from civilisation.

A freak accident during the return trip resulted in the loss of most of Commander Lewis's food supplies, leaving him with only tea and an assortment of biscuits for the six-month journey home. After being treated for malnutrition and diabetes, Commander Lewis spoke to the media about his ordeal:

\The journey was a nightmare. I kept getting lost, and was haunted by images of long-dead 21st century actors. If it wasn't for my 1,000 friends on social media, I would have gone insane. I don't think I'll ever eat another biscuit.\

* Galactic News: Appeal for Ancient Data Concludes
A spokesperson for United Meene Labour has announced that its appeal for data from the Synuefe ruins has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Felice Dock, the organisation's base of operations.

Engineer Ram Tah, who is leading research into the ruins, has extended his gratitude to the many independent explorers who responded to the appeal.

In a statement, Ram Tah said:

\I can't wait to start analysing the data. With luck, this will be the first step towards unlocking the ruins' secrets.\

Ram Tah went on to say he would do everything in his power to ensure the site was protected from \irresponsible agencies seeking to capitalise on the site for personal, political or military gain.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.


* Galactic News: Anarchist Organisation Closes Starport
Recent reports indicate that Wright City in the Elli system has fallen prey to a chemical-weapon attack.

The attack is believed to have been executed by the anarchist organisation Revolution Incorporated, which recently placed orders for a quantity of Toxandji Virocide, a rare pesticide. It is understood the group used the pesticide as the basis for a potent chemical weapon.

The impact on the starport has been catastrophic. Over a dozen individuals have lost their lives, and hundreds more are in critical condition. As a result, the starport has been closed until further notice.

System security forces have already started hunting for Revolution Incorporated, but with little physical evidence and few leads, the chances of bringing the culprits to justice are slim.


* Community Goal: The Battle for Maia Continues
Two weeks ago, conflict erupted between the Ant Hill Mob and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise in the Maia system. But this was no ordinary inter-factional dispute. According to various sources, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise was acting under direct orders from Federation officials eager to bring Maia under Federal control.

With both sides bolstered by Pilots Federation Commanders, the battle was intense and wide ranging. After several days of conflict it was the Pleiades Resource Enterprise that emerged victorious, successfully gaining a foothold in Maia.

But it seems the battle for Maia is far from over. Recent reports indicate that the Ant Hill Mob is about to launch a retaliatory assault with the aim of pushing the Pleiades Resource Enterprise out of Maia.

The organisation has devised a two-pronged strategy to regain control, and has appealed to the galactic community for support. In addition to targeting Pleiades Resource Enterprise fighters, the Ant Hill Mob has asked pilots to deliver battle weapons to system security forces, who will be supporting the Ant Hill Mob during the conflict.

Pilots who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on the 10th of November 3302 and will run for one week.


* Zosi Major Corporation Issues Request
The Zosi Major Corporation, an independent organisation based in the Zosi system, has placed an open order for thermic alloys, chemical manipulators and industrial firmware. According to the organisation's spokesperson, the resources will be used in an unspecified research and development project.

Dr Arkady Cole, the organisation's chief research scientist, released the following statement:

\We want the resources, yes? Very useful to us. Process is simple. Deliver the resources and be paid. Yes.\

Despite the opaque nature of the request, it is likely the generous reimbursements offered by the Zosi Major Corporation will ensure its orders are met. Participating pilots have been instructed to deliver the requested commodities to Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system.

The campaign begins on the 10th of November and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Weekly Democracy Report

* Community Goal: Conflict Continues in Maia
Early reports from the Maia system indicate that the Ant Hill Mob has delivered a significant blow to the Pleiades Resource Enterprise. The news comes less than 24 hours after the criminal organisation launched an operation to push the PRE out of Maia.

It is understood the Ant Hill Mob leveraged its connections in Maia's criminal network to achieve its aims in a remarkably short amount of time.

But the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is not out of the fight yet. The organisation has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Maia and the surrounding systems, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Obsidian Orbital.

The campaign will run from the 11th to the 17th of November 3302. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Appeal for Resources Ends
Dr Arkady Cole, chief research scientist for the Zosi Major Corporation, has announced that the organisation's request for resources has been warmly received by the galactic community.

The organisation has confirmed that it has received sufficient quantities of thermic alloys, chemical manipulators and industrial firmware to proceed with its proposed research project, the exact nature of which has not been publicly disclosed.

In a characteristically succinct statement, Dr Cole thanked those who had responded to the request:

\Many resources received. Everyone get their money. Now go away and leave me alone! Very busy. Much work to do.\

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system.


* Galactic News: Order Temporarily Restored in Maia
The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has announced that its operation to weaken Maia's criminal network has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's appeal for support, taking to their ships to eliminate the agitators operating in the system.

The victory may give the Pleiades Resource Enterprise the time it needs to recover its strength, and prepare for the next phase in its fight against the Ant Hill Mob.

Pilots who contributed to the operation can collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital.


* Galactic News: Ant Hill Mob Wins
Media outlets in Maia have reported that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has once again emerged victorious from a conflict with the Ant Hill Mob. The battle, instigated by the Ant Hill Mob, was designed to weaken the Enterprise's position in Maia.

Hundreds of independent pilots supported the campaign by targeting Pleiades Resource Enterprise fighters and delivering battle weapons to system security forces. But ultimately it was not enough to defeat the PRE.

A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise released a brief statement:

\Clearly, the galactic community supports our position in Maia. The Ant Hill Mob needs to accept that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is here to stay. We're not going anywhere.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Community Goal: Competing Appeals for Exploration Data
The Federal astrocartography department has issued a public request for exploration data. Mark Devene, head of the department, elaborated on the nature of the appeal:

\We are looking for data from three specific zones in order to verify certain hypotheses. We want high-quality information on system configurations, planet types, spectral classes and compositions.\

\We are looking at the following coordinates: PLAA AEC IZ-N C20-1, PRU AESCS DL-W C15-37 and EAFOTS EU-R C4-1. Explorers might be more familiar with the colloquial names for these areas \u2013 Hawkin's Gap, the Conflux and the Formidine Rift. Pilots should travel to one of these locations and investigate out to a radius of 200 light years.\

The Tau Ceti Crimson Legal Solutions has volunteered to coordinate the Federal operation. Meanwhile, mysterious organisation The Children of Raxxla has issued an identical request, claiming the data will be used to prove the innocence of the group's leader, Kahina Loren.

Both campaigns begin on the 17th of November 3302 and will run for two weeks.


* Community Goal: Aid for D'Arrest Station
In February this year, Princess Aisling Duval established a repatriation centre for former slaves at D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. Since then the centre has gone from strength to strength, successfully emancipating thousands of slaves and rescuing hundreds from the horrors of illegal slavery.

When the initiative launched, many of Princess Aisling's detractors dismissed it as a publicity stunt, but her ongoing commitment to the centre has silenced even her most ardent critics. It is understood that she receives daily updates from D'Arrest Station, and makes personal visits once a month.

It therefore comes as little surprise that, following news of an outbreak at the starport, Princess Aisling has secured funding for a relief effort. In a statement, the princess expressed concern for those affected:

\It is extremely important that the unfortunate people at D'Arrest Station receive help as soon as possible, and I implore the galactic community to come to their aid. The Uibuth Empire Party has graciously offered to coordinate the relief effort.\

The Uibuth Empire Party has promised to reward pilots who deliver basic medicines to D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. The campaign begins on the 17th of November and will run for one week. If targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Construction Convoy Assembled
A large convoy of heavy construction ships and associated support vessels has been assembled by Wreaken Construction in the Zearla system.

Wreaken does not have an exclusive contract with any of the galaxy's superpowers, and there has therefore been significant speculation over the purpose of the convoy.

Requests for information have been met with blank rebuttals, and recent press statements from Wreaken make no mention of the convoy. Long-range reconnaissance has revealed a well-defended operation, and approaches are greeted with patrol ships and warning shots.

Meanwhile, shares in Wreaken have gone up by five per cent as speculation grips the financial markets. Some commentators believe this is directly linked to Admiral Denton Patreus's recent comments concerning the London Treaty.

* Galactic News: MetaDrive Audit Complete
The independent audit of defunct technology company MetaDrive Inc. has now reached an end and, other than a few minor items, the acquisition of all remaining assets has been completed.

One such item is the Imperial Eagle of the company's late chairman Femi Dakarai, which was owned by MetaDrive. In a strange turn of events, the ship was stolen by former MetaDrive employee Raan Corsen, who disappeared shortly after the audit began.

A number of files relating to Dakarai's affairs are also believed to be missing. A junior member of the audit team reported that a series of so-called 'exodus documents' could not be located. The employee was unceremoniously removed from the audit team shortly afterwards.

A spokesperson for BigSix, the auditor, provided a statement:

\The audit of MetaDrive is now complete, and contrary to previous misleading reports, we have all the documentation we need. It transpires the Eagle spacecraft stolen by Raan Corsen crashed somewhere in the Alioth system while fleeing security forces. The vessel was fully insured, so BigSix is not unduly concerned by its loss.\

The Buckyball Racing Club is back with a new race, and this time it's taking on the aliens.

Kick the Alien (and Run like Hell) is a 26-kilometre roundtrip SRV race. The event starts at the Noctrach-Ihazevich Research facility and involves driving to the nearby crash site, 'kicking the alien', and then driving back to the research facility as fast as possible.

A representative for the Buckyball Racing Club said: \All other methods of interaction with the crash sites have failed to get a response \u2013 perhaps this will wake them up\.

The race starts on Saturday the 26th of November and is expected to last for two weeks. Competitors can make their run at any time during this period, and can run as many times as they like.

For many retailers, this Friday is one of the busiest days of the year, as prices are slashed and consumers compete to take advantage of a range of one-day offers.

As the fateful day draws near, Tchernobog Free, a retail conglomerate based in the Tchernobog system, has placed an open order for various commodities to help it meet demand. The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver domestic appliances, clothing and consumer technology to its base of operations at Vancouver Ring.

A spokesperson for the organisation gave a brief statement to the media:

\Half of my suppliers have let me down and I've got investors breathing down my neck. I don't care how you do it \u2013 just get me those goods!\

The campaign begins on the 24th of November 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: A Bright Future for D'Arrest Station
The Uibuth Empire Party has announced that its appeal for basic medicines has received the unconditional support of the galactic community. Over the past week, huge quantities of medication have been delivered to D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system, which will be used to control the outbreak currently plaguing the starport.

Princess Aisling Duval, who funded the relief effort and whose repatriation centre is based at the starport, released a brief statement:

\I would like to extend my most sincere gratitude to those who supported this campaign. Medical personnel at D'Arrest Station have assured me that the situation will soon be in hand.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system.

* Galactic News: Ram Tah Releases Statement
Earlier this month, engineer Ram Tah announced a research programme designed to uncover the secrets of the Synuefe ruins. The engineer asked pilots to deliver data from the site to his laboratory in the hope that he would be able to decipher it.

But Ran Tah's silence has prompted some to speculate that the engineer might not be up to the task of decoding the data, and that his attempt was nothing more than the naive dream of a backwater mechanic.

When approached with these criticisms, Ram Tah said:

\These things take time. I believe I have made a breakthrough, but I will not be pressured into offering untested claims. As soon as I have results, the galaxy will know.\


* Galactic News: Prisoner Convoy Destroyed
A prisoner convoy has been interdicted and destroyed in the Daibo system while en route to Koontz Asylum. Wreckage found in Daibo has been positively identified as belonging to the Imperial Cutter 'Diadem' and the Imperial Clippers 'Cypripedium', 'Velum', 'Monile' and 'Vestimenta'.

\Completely wiped out,\ said one pilot, who was one of the first to respond to the distress call. \By the time I arrived there was nothing but floating debris. We even found wreckage from escape pods. Someone wanted to make sure there were absolutely no survivors. Even the black boxes were blasted.\

It has been confirmed that the convoy was carrying various political dissidents, convicted murderers and terrorists. Among them was the infamous Kahina Loren, recently found guilty of the attempted assassination of Admiral Denton Patreus.

\Maybe someone wanted to give her a merciful death,\ said the chief editor of The Imperial Citizen. \Better that than what awaited her at Koontz Asylum, for sure.\

Plans to hold a memorial service for Loren in the Prism system have already generated angry responses. Princess Aisling Duval was quoted as saying, \A service for her? She was a murderer and a convicted felon! Her name should be struck from the record and never spoken again.\

Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Freelance Report: Record-Breaking Tourist Trip
Since the Pilots Federation endorsed passenger flights and the Beluga luxury liner entered the market, the tourism industry has boomed. Commander Duck of Death, a seasoned explorer, took this reporter on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the far side of the galaxy.

Our journey took us to the Black in Green Nebula, Sagittarius A* and the Red and Green Glory Nebula, as well as a planetary ring with a staggering 54 million kilometre radius. But that wasn't all.

\I've been planning to go to Beagle Point for a few months,\ said Duck of Death. \Since I'm on the original roster, I feel I have an obligation to complete the expedition.\

Spirits were high as we traversed the abyss and entered the Solitude Void, but as the bright lights of the core dwindled, I could sense the primordial fear building. Finally, we reached Beagle Point. Before us was the entire Milky Way, farther away than ever, and behind us...the rest of the universe. We were standing on the edge of infinity.

If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Freelance Report: Guardian Archangel
Last week, the galaxy witnessed a truly audacious rescue.

While returning from Beagle Point, Commander Felix Macedonica found himself without sufficient germanium to synthesise an FSD injection and continue his journey home. Faced with the choice of spending the rest of his life 65,000 light years from home or destroying his beloved Lakon Type-6E and riding the escape capsule back to civilisation, Felix was in dire straits indeed.

At that moment, Commander Chiggy Vonrictofen was exploring the Zunou sector. When Chiggy picked up a weak sub-ether distress signal, he quickly established a private link with Felix before appraising the system for asteroid belts and ringed planets that could potentially yield germanium. He then departed for Colonia to fit a mining laser and larger fuel tank.

With his ship appropriately equipped, Chiggy proceeded to cover the first 30,000 light years from Jaques in less than 13 hours, a wraith of speed and purpose. Stopping only to sleep, he finally arrived less than 48 hours after receiving Felix's first transmission.

The pair travelled to the nearest belt and Chiggy spooled up the mining laser as Felix watched the scanner. Nickel, iron, sulphur, manganese, phosphorus \u2013 the elements kept coming, but not the one they needed.

Despair started to creep in. Then it appeared, a word that brought with it a cascade of emotions: germanium. Felix swooped in and secured his freedom.

\Chiggy's efforts have left me speechless,\ said Felix. \His perseverance shows that the indomitable human spirit has no bounds.\

* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion
Ever since Jaques Station arrived in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 in June, thousands of galactic citizens have migrated to the system in search of a new way of life. The migration movement has resulted in a number of new outposts in the region, as well as a chain of stations connecting the burgeoning community with the core systems.

With the colony now firmly established in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 \u2013 recently renamed Colonia \u2013 the system's governing body, the Colonia Council, has announced plans to colonise the surrounding systems.

In keeping with the spirit of egalitarianism that has characterised the colonisation movement, the Council has announced plans to run a series of appeals that will determine which organisations will occupy the systems surrounding Colonia.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:

\With the help of the galactic community, we have been able to establish a secure presence in the Colonia system. Now it's time to open up the rest of the sector for colonisation.\

\It is very important that those coming to the Colonia Nebula be committed to the area's ongoing development. That's why we're asking organisations that want to join the Colonia community to demonstrate their dedication by contributing to a resource drive.\

\At the start of each month, we will announce which systems have been targeted for colonisation. To earn a migration visa, pilots must deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation. The nature of the commodity will be specified at the start of the month. Naturally, pilots will be reimbursed for their efforts.\

\At the end of the month, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation's sole use.\

\We should point out that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will be considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction.\

\Furthermore, the successful organisations will be responsible for working with other like-minded organisations to make the Colonia Nebula a beacon of civilisation.\

The first campaign begins on the 1st of December 3302 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Exploration Data Appeals Conclude
A spokesperson for The Children of Raxxla has announced that its appeal for exploration data has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community, which delivered large quantities of astronomical data to Sereborv Terminal over the past two weeks. A competing initiative from the Federation proved less popular with the galactic community.

In a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked those who had contributed to the initiative, and continued to say:

\We know there are secrets buried in this data. We only hope we can unlock them in time.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Sereborv Terminal in the HR 6421 system.


* Galactic News: Retail Appeal Ends
A spokesperson for Tchernobog Free has announced that its appeal for consumer goods has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge quantity of deliveries to Vancouver Ring, the organisation's base of operations.

The support of the galactic community allowed Tchernobog Free to keep up with the incredibly high demand ushered in by last Friday's competitive one-day deals.

In a statement, the spokesperson said:

\I'd all but given up. I just couldn't see how we'd get the goods in time. But then a ship docked at Vancouver Ring, groaning under the weight of its cargo. And then another, and another.\

\To the pilots who came to our aid, I just want to say \u2013 you saved my life!\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vancouver Ring in the Tchernobog system.


* Community Goal: People's Tutumu Confederacy Appeal
As the end of the galactic year draws near and people throughout the galaxy start preparing for their end-of-year celebrations, the People's Tutumu Confederacy has announced a special seasonal event.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement.

\We have placed an open order for gold, pyrophyllite, and mineral oil, and in keeping with the spirit of the season we are offering generous premiums for these items. Additionally, every pilot who brings us these goods will be automatically entered into a prize draw, giving them the opportunity to win a range of fantastic prizes.\

\The more you contribute, the better your chance of winning!\

The campaign will run from the 1st to the 16th of December 3302. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Ram Tah Laboratory Attacked
A few days ago, the research centre at Felice Dock in the Meene system was severely damaged in what has been described as 'an act of vandalism'. Authorities at the starport have confirmed that the attack left many of the facilities irreparably damaged.

Readers will no doubt recall that Ram Tah's research project into the ruins of the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system is based at Felice Dock.

When asked about the delay in investigating the crime, system security forces said it was considered 'low priority', and that it was \probably the work of opportunists.\

Ram Tah released the following statement:

\This is clearly an attempt to undermine my research into the Synuefe ruins. Since my investigations began, a number of agencies have made clear their desire to capitalise on the site for personal, political or military gain. The knowledge contained in the ruins does not belong to one individual or organisation \u2013 it belongs to everyone.\

\My research programme has relocated to Phoenix Base. Strict security protocols have been instated, and anyone approaching without invitation will be fired upon.\

Since this statement was made, the research facility at Phoenix Base has been operating in total radio silence.


* Galactic News: Amateurs Partially Decrypt Signal
A small group of EM-transmission technology enthusiasts in the Tionisla system claims to have partially decoded the encrypted message transmitted from the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard by an antique Cobra Mk III a few months ago.

A spokesperson for the group, which calls itself The Hamsters, said:

\So exciting! It was an EM frequency using phase modulation. Really quite clever. It contains a string of numbers, but we don't know what they mean, so we've decided to share it with the galactic community in the hope that someone might be able to decode it. The sequence is: 01 07 10 * 20 22 25 * 01 05 23 03 23 * 10 27 - 23 * 02 03 01 - 02 * 03 04 * 01 * 43 33 31 23 * 07 21 25 27.\

Unfortunately The Hamsters' broadcast abruptly stopped at this point, and only static has been received since. When asked about the sudden silence, authorities in Tionisla made the following statement:

\We had no choice but to take them offline as they hadn't renewed their broadcasting licence. We will restore their broadcasting privileges once the appropriate charges have been paid.\

* Freelance Report: Protesters Gather at Buckyball Events
In response to the Kick the Alien (and Run like Hell) race, which began on the 22nd of November, huge numbers of protesters have started attending Buckyball Racing Club events throughout the galaxy. Identifying themselves as members of a religious order called the Apocolyptican Faith, the protesters claim the crash site is sacred to their faith and should be protected by law. A spokesperson for the organisation said it would continue to protest at Buckyball events until the club issued a formal apology.

Primus Timothy Dalen, a representative of the organisation, said:

\We are very disappointed with Buckyball Racing Club for treating the cultural and religious practices of others so lightly. We are working towards having these sites protected by local and territorial law, and hope to have something in place by the end of the year.\

* Freelance Report: Pilot Completes Extensive Survey
Commander MissingSea of the Deep Recon X exploration team has completed an extensive survey of the Eol Prou GG-X d1 sub-sector, located between 260 and 370 light years from Colonia.

The region contains a total of 858 solar systems, only four of which were logged in the Universal Cartographics database prior to Commander MissingSea's expedition.

In total, Commander MissingSea scanned 1,676 stellar bodies, 5,088 planets and most of the sub-sector's 8,705 moons. Of the planets scanned, 332 contained some form of life and a further 333 were found to be candidates for terraforming.

The survey began on the 30th of August and finished on the 3rd of December 3302. The survey overview data is available on request.

LHS 3479 Interstellar

LTT 377 Purple General Corp.

Ross 754 Universal and Co

Luyten 674-15 Industries

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

Cemiess Commodities

Yakabugai Exchange

Kini Drug Empire

Order of Ethgreze

United LHS 3479 Green Party

Crimson State Group

GCRV 4654 State

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

HR 8170 Brotherhood

Djabe Order

Jaques

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats

Partnership of Triviatii

Lampade Empire Party

HIP 27371 Empire League

Wolf 718 Comms Solutions

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Crimson State Group

Iptera Allied Corp.

* Community Goal: Putting LP 339-7 on the Map
Dr Lewis Chapman, CEO of the Starship Enterprises Corporation, has announced plans to transform the LP 339-7 system into a popular tourist destination.

To achieve this, the Starship Enterprises Corporation intends to establish a wildlife reserve on the planet LP 339-7 4 A. The reserve will be occupied by various cloned Earth animals, genetically tailored to suit their environments, created by the Starship Enterprises Corporation.

In support of this project, the corporation has placed an open order for progenitor cells, animal monitors, aquaponic systems, atmospheric processors, land enrichment systems and advanced medicines. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in LP 339-7, to ensure that those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 15th of December 3302 and will run for one week.

* Galactic News: Federal Exploration Programme in Disarray
Last month, the Federation launched an appeal for exploration data from a number of remote locations. A competitive appeal was simultaneously launched by a mysterious group known as the Children of Raxxla, which succeeded in completely derailing the Federal initiative. Karl Devene, head of Astrocartography at Mars High, was forced to resign as a result.

Federal exploration projects are currently on hold as a result of the failed initiative, and Devene's successor has not been announced. Meanwhile, the Children of Raxxla has yet to reveal any findings from the data it received, leading some to speculate that the organisation never intended to.

\I believe it was a cynical attempt to sabotage Federal research,\ said a spokesperson for Mars High Astrocartography. \It was never about exonerating Salom\u00e9 \u2013 they just used her plight to gain the data at the expense of the Federation. Unfortunately, the galactic community proved itself easily manipulated.\

Other commentators have concurred with the analysis. Jackson Trent, associate editor of The Imperial Citizen, said:

\I don't understand the allure of Raxxla. They attacked Patreus's flagship and have proved themselves to be criminals of the worst kind. Patreus dealt with Emperor's Dawn \u2013 perhaps it's time for him to deal with the Children of Raxxla.\

Salom\u00e9, known in Imperial circles as Kahina Loren, was killed when the convoy transporting her to Koontz Asylum was interdicted and destroyed. She had been convicted of the attempted assassination of Denton Patreus.

Meanwhile, independent pilots returning from the expedition have reported a series of curious beacons in deep space, but few details have surfaced.


* Freelance Report: Allitnil Shatters Fuel-Economy Records
A new record has been set by Commander Allitnil, who successfully travelled from Sol to Jaques Station in Colonia without making any stops...or equipping a fuel scoop.

The impressive feat took nine days, 5,489 hyperspace jumps and 383 tonnes of hydrogen fuel. Although Commander Allitnil travelled mostly in economic mode, providing regular updates and efficiency calculations, many doubted the trip was possible. But it soon became clear that the amazing efficiency of Allitnil's Anaconda would get him to Jaques with plenty of fuel to spare.

Rumours have surfaced that Commander Allitnil's next challenge might involve travelling from Sol to Beagle Point, but nothing has yet been confirmed.

* Galactic News: Festive Appeal Concludes
Clauss Incorporated has announced that its festive appeal received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community, with hundreds of pilots taking to their ships to transport personal gifts from Frost Dock in the Njambalba system to Clauss Port in the Santa Muerte system. Nicolas St Clauss, CEO of Clauss Incorporated, released a brief statement:

\We're delighted with the response. We'd like to thank the galactic community for helping us spread joy through the galaxy.\

In addition to offering generous remuneration, Clauss Incorporated has promised to reward those who made the largest contributions with special festive prizes.


* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes
The Alliance has announced that its campaign to build a planetary outpost in the California Nebula has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal for construction materials by delivering geological equipment, hazardous environment suits and surface stabilisers to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.

The campaign also received the support of hundreds of combat pilots, who protected those delivering commodities by neutralising agitators in Furuhjelm III-674.

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon released a brief statement:

\I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to those who supported this campaign. Remember \u2013 the Alliance means freedom.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.


* Community Goal: Balones Gold Touch Systems Appeals for Materials
Balones Gold Touch Systems has placed an open order for materials for use in a forthcoming project. A bulletin from the organisation confirms that pilots who deliver mined osmium, praseodymium and methanol monohydrate crystals to Tiedemann Dock in the Balones system will be generously rewarded.

A spokesperson for the organisation elaborated on the nature of the project:

\The purpose of this programme is to develop a number of advanced deep-space probes \u2013 ones that will reveal more about what lies beyond the borders of our galaxy.\

\We at Balones Gold Touch Systems believe galactic civilisation is on the cusp of a paradigm shift. The alien shipwrecks and the Synuefe ruins leave no room for doubt: we are not alone in the universe.\

\Knowledge is the currency of the future. Not money. Not weapons. Knowledge. And how best to acquire this knowledge? With the instruments that Balones Gold Touch Systems is developing.\

The campaign begins on the 5th of January 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion
Last month, the Colonia Council launched the first in a series of initiatives to determine which organisations would join the rapidly expanding Colonia community. The Council has now launched a second initiative, once again giving the galaxy's minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:

\We were delighted with the response to the first initiative, which demonstrated a clear commitment to the Colonia community.\

\For this appeal, we are once again asking pilots to deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation in order to earn a migration visa.\

\At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation's sole use.\

The campaign begins on the 5th of January 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Thargoids Sighted?
Media outlets throughout the galaxy are abuzz with news of an event that many are interpreting as an encounter with non-human life.

According to reports, an independent pilot by the name of Commander DP Sayre was interdicted en route to the Aries Dark Region XU-O b6-3 by a highly unusual ship bearing no resemblance to any known human craft.

As the Commander's ship was plucked from hyperspace, all their systems were completely disabled. The mysterious craft subjected the pilot's vessel to some kind of scan before departing, at which point the hapless Commander's ship returned to life.

Commentators reviewing the pilot's recording of the event have noted strong similarities between the mysterious craft and the shipwrecks found in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 and the HIP 17862 system.

Is the ship a Thargoid vessel? This is the question many are asking.

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute updates on this story.


* Galactic News: Weekly Conflict Report

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Hyperspace
Continuing our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the development of the hyperdrive.

\Hyperspace technology originated in the early 22nd Century, but it wasn't until the 2800s that consumer ships began to take advantage of it.\

\The first commercially available hyperspace system was known as the 'Faraway Jump'. The Faraway system was far from perfect, however, depending on a complex network of monitoring satellites, branch lines, stop points and rescue stations \u2013 which took hundreds of years to establish \u2013 to operate smoothly.\

\It was around this time the phrase 'witch-space' first appeared, reflecting the inherent dangers of early hyperspace technology and the strange 'corridor' a ship travelled through during a hyperspace jump. Some even believed witch-space was haunted by 'ghosts of ships that went into Faraway and didn't come out again'. It is certainly true that a number of ships never reached their destinations.\

\The original hyperdrives were powered by a fuel known as quirium, the formula for which was a closely guarded secret. When this formula was lost, the hyperspace industry suffered a major setback. A number of different drives strove to fill the void left by the quirium drives, but it was the Type 2b that proved most popular. Unfortunately, ships equipped with a 2b left behind a hyperspace 'cloud' at their entry and exit points, making it all too easy for malcontents to track and ambush these vessels.\

\In the late 3290s, a new hyperspace system emerged that immediately rendered the Type 2b obsolete. Jump times were reduced to mere seconds, as they had been with quirium drives, without any loss in jump range. Journeys that had hitherto been considered unfeasible were now within the realms of possibility.\

\Even today, hyperspace remains poorly understood. Many pilots have reported glimpsing inexplicable lights, and even structures, within the witch-space tunnels. It may be centuries before all of its mysteries are unravelled.\


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Fawaol Patrons of Law

Durius Dominion

Allied Herthans Front

Betel Free

Lao Gobe Coalition

Sui Xenates Indie Union

Jaques

Labour of Kalads

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats

Styra Empire League

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Ross 754 Labour

* Freelance Report: Imperial Factions React to Discovery
In recent days, a number of pilots have reported being pulled from hyperspace by alien-looking ships. Reactions have ranged from shock and fear to curiosity and excitement.

Influential Imperial groups the Chapterhouse of Inquisition, Lavigny's Legion and the 9th Legion have issued strict no-fire orders to their pilots in the event that they are confronted by these mysterious vessels. The orders follow reports that the ships are not acting aggressively and are simply scanning ships they encounter.

\Under no circumstances should any of our pilots engage these vessels,\ said Governor Shelby Ortega, speaking from Chapterhouse of Inquisition headquarters in Kamadhenu.

\We do not know their motivations, so to act rashly could have dire consequences. Be mindful that these vessels can seemingly disable ship systems on a whim. We should avoid making enemies of beings we know nothing about.\

* Galactic News: Engineers Reduce Requirements
The galaxy's independent engineers have announced a joint accord designed to make enhancements for civilian spacecraft more affordable. A spokesperson confirmed the accord was intended to ensure the safety of independent pilots traversing the space lanes.

As a consequence, independent engineers will no longer require commodities in order to upgrade modules and weapons \u2013 only materials will be needed.

Meanwhile, in a fortunate turn of events, analysts have reported that the market value of a number of commodities has risen. Consequently, pilots seeking to offload commodities can do so profitably.

* Galactic News: Appeal for Materials Concludes
A spokesperson for Balones Gold Touch Systems has announced that its appeal for materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Tiedemann Dock, the organisation's base of operations.

A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement:

\Balones Gold Touch Systems extends its deepest gratitude to the galactic community for its support.\

\We know you have questions, but we make you no promises. It will take time to develop these devices. And even when the probes are despatched, we may find nothing. But anything we do discover, we will readily share with the galactic community.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tiedemann Dock in the Balones system.


* Community Goal: Conflict in Parun
It has been several weeks since conflict was reported between the Empire and the Federation, following months of hostility between the two superpowers. The last incident connected to the Empire-Federation rift was a clash between the Pleiades Resource Enterprise and the Ant Hill Mob in November. Since then, there have been no reports of conflict.

But intelligence recovered from the Parun system indicates that Laksmii Jet Power Industries, an Empire-aligned organisation, has devised a plot to smuggle quantities of personal weapons, explosives and reactive armour into Underwood Port. It is understood that Imperial agents based in the system will use these items to conduct guerrilla attacks against the Independents of Parun, the system's controlling faction.

Having received word of this plot, the Independents of Parun has placed bounties on all Laksmii Jet Power Industries ships operating in Parun in the hope of thwarting the operation. Both factions have appealed to the galactic community for support, promising to reward pilots who support their campaigns.

The rival operations begin on the 12th of January 3303 and will run for one week. If either organisation achieves its aims earlier than planned, the operations will end immediately.


* Freelance Report: Fuel Rats Complete 20,000th Rescue
On the 7th of January 3303, the Fuel Rats successfully completed their 20,000th rescue since their foundation in June 3301. The milestone was reached during a busy weekend that saw the group complete a total of 230 rescues. Sources at Fuel Rats headquarters in the Fuelum system linked the spike in cases to curiosity surrounding reported sightings of non-human spacecraft.

The Fuel Rats Mischief, an auxiliary wing of the Fuel Rats, revealed that the 20,000th rescue took place in the Alrai Sector, with Commanders Esxste, FightingCookie and Hillbillypolenta flying out to rescue the stranded pilot. The group also paid tribute to Commander Termite Altair, who has completed an unprecedented 750 successful rescues.

When asked about reports of alien ships, a Fuel Rats spokesperson said the group would remain true to its policy of neutrality and give fuel to non-human vessels if requested.

* Galactic News: Superpowers Respond to Strange Sightings
Following several sightings of mysterious spacecraft, the leaders of the galaxy's three superpowers have released official statements.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, currently undertaking a tour of Imperial systems, exhibited reservation:

\To surmise that these encounters constitute proof of the existence of non-human intelligence would be rash in the extreme. We cannot rule out the possibility that these ships could be experimental human spacecraft, or even the product of an intricate hoax. I urge all Imperial citizens to remain calm, and not to leap to conclusions.\

Federal President Zachary Hudson, meanwhile, struck a characteristically strident tone:

\I have reviewed the footage submitted by the galactic community. Granted, the evidence is not conclusive. But tell me this: would you rather prepare for an attack that may not come, or be met by an attack you did not prepare for? We know nothing about the true nature or purpose of these vessels. It would be in our best interest to prepare for any eventuality.\

By contrast, Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was diplomatic:

\Like the Emperor, I believe it would be premature to conclude that these are non-human spacecraft. But it is clear to me that these encounters warrant further investigation. We must gather more evidence and keep an open mind. Knowledge, not ignorance. Proof, not speculation. That is the way forward.\

* Galactic News: Independent Scientists Comment on Sightings
Professor Ishmael Palin, independent scientist and leading authority on xeno-biological research, has added his voice to the debate over sightings of mysterious spacecraft.

In a statement, Professor Palin said:

\I have no wish to be alarmist, and I can understand why the galactic superpowers have issued a somewhat noncommittal response. But suggesting that these craft may be of human origin, or the product of a hoax, rather stretches plausibility.\

\To my mind, there is a clear visual connection between these mysterious vessels, the shipwrecks found in HIP 17862 and the Pleiades, the Unknown Artefacts and the Unknown Probes. And I believe we can draw only one conclusion: we are sharing the galaxy with an intelligent non-human species. We therefore have an obligation to discover as much about this species, and its intentions, as possible.\

Independent engineer Ram Tah, who has been leading research into the Synuefe ruins, also commented:

\I share Professor Palin's view that these reports are of great significance. But attempts to communicate with these vessels have proved fruitless, as have efforts to discern their point of origin. We must learn more about these ships and whoever \u2013 or whatever \u2013 is piloting them.\

The operation centred on smuggling various items into Underwood Port so Imperial agents could use it to conduct guerrilla attacks against the  Independents of Parun, the system's controlling faction.

After learning of the plot, the Independents of Parun placed bounties on Laksmii Jet Power Industries ships operating in the Parun system. The strategy resulted in the destruction of hundreds of Laksmii Jet Power Industries vessels, severely undermining the organisation's plan.

A spokesperson for the Independents of Parun thanked those who supported the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Underwood Port in the Parun system.


* Community Goal: Sirius Corp. to Address Unknown-Artefact Issue
It is widely understood that Unknown Artefacts have the ability to extract materials from their immediate environment as part of a complex self-repair process. Unfortunately, this can have disastrous effects on starships and other forms of machinery.

Perhaps the worst affected by this phenomena have been the galaxy's starports, many of which have had to suspend services as a result of Unknown Artefact-related disruption. The high prices offered for Unknown Artefacts on the black market means many starports have been flooded with the mysterious objects. And although meta-alloys can be used to counter Unknown Artefact-related interference, the scarcity of the material means this potential salve has had little impact.

But a recent announcement from the Sirius Corporation indicates that the company intends to tackle the issue by funding a major new research and development project. The purpose of the project is to make starports and other outposts more resistant to Unknown Artefact-related interference through the application of specific microresources.

In support of this programme, the Sirius Corporation has placed an open order for unknown fragments, untypical shield scans and aberrant shield pattern analysis, and promised to reward pilots who deliver these materials to Cormack Hub in the Procyon system.

The campaign begins on the 19th of January 3303 and will run for two weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

A spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation has announced that its appeal for microresources has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the corporation's appeal by delivering unknown fragments, untypical shield scans and aberrant shield pattern analysis to Cormack Hub in the Procyon system.

As the campaign drew to a close, Li-Yong Rui, CEO of Sirius Gov, released a statement:

\While irresponsible fortune hunters continue to destabilise the galaxy's starports by selling Unknown Artefacts on the black market, the galaxy's superpowers stand idly by, mired in bureaucracy and paralysed by indecision. Well, we say: no more.\

\I will do everything in my power to put an end to the technological plague and restore the galaxy's starports to functionality. The effort to conquer this epidemic starts now.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cormack Hub in the Procyon system.


* Galactic News: Clandestine Federal-Imperial Negotiations?
Animosity between the Empire and the Federation has been growing for months, but leaked communications suggest that clandestine negotiations may be taking place between the two superpowers.

Jason Nygaard, a reporter for The Federal Times, said:

\We believe the Federation is meeting with Imperial dignities behind closed doors. The nature of these meetings isn't clear, but we have noted unusual ship movements around the historic Cambridge space port.\

Cambridge, once of the few ancient Earth cities preserved in its historic form, is notably free from surveillance. It has been associated with many remarkable events in its long history.

* Galactic News: Ram Tah Discovers New Sites
Following his recent appeal for data from the Synuefe ruins, engineer Ram Tah has released a statement:

\Using the data contributed by the galactic community, I have succeeded in accessing the monolith network. But although I have detected a number of further Guardian sites \u2013 which is very exciting \u2013 I have not been able to divine their precise locations. All I have been able to do is narrow the field to a handful of systems \u2013 specifically Synuefe ZL-J d10-119, Synuefe XO-P c22-17, IC 2391 Sector ZE-A d101 and IC 2391 Sector GW-V b2-4.\

* Community Goal: Alliance Appeals for Help
The Alliance Council of Admirals has announced that an Alliance convoy has been attacked in the Fedmich system.

According to a statement, the convoy was transporting personnel and military equipment to a secure Alliance outpost. It is understood the attack was executed by criminals operating in Fedmich.

Most personnel were safely evacuated, but many of the ships comprising the convoy had to be abandoned. Furthermore, a number of occupied escape pods remain among the wreckage.

A spokesperson for the Council of Admirals released a statement:

\It is imperative that all personnel and material carried by this convoy be recovered as soon as possible.\

\To that end, we have authorised Fedmich Electronics Partners to coordinate a rescue operation, and will gladly reward those who deliver occupied escape pods and wreckage components to Roberts Port in the Fedmich system. Combat pilots are also needed to neutralise agitators operating in Fedmich and thus ensure the safety of those recovering material from the convoy.\

* Community Goal: Halsey to Build Refugee Centre
Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has announced plans to establish a rehabilitation centre for victims of war \u2013 specifically those affected by the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict. In a statement, Halsey said:

\The centre will of course provide victims with food and shelter, but it will also serve to reunite families and friends, and where necessary will help those affected by war relocate to new systems.\

Humanitarian groups were quick to applaud Halsey, who since being discharged from the Clearwater Clinic in July last year has repeatedly expressed her commitment to peace.

The campaign has received financial support from the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry, which has placed an open order for Power Generators, Tantalum and Polymers for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver these commodities to Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on the 2nd of February 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Children of Raxxla Release Report
The Children of Raxxla, based in the HR 6421 system, have released an analysis of the exploration data recovered by the galactic community in November last year.

A spokesperson for the organisation said:

\There was a vast amount of data to sift through, but our analysis led to some notable discoveries in the Formidine Rift, the Conflux and Hawkin's Gap. There are indications that some kind of covert mission took place in these regions back in the 3270s. So far we have found shipwrecks, beacons and abandoned settlements dating from that time, and logs and records relating to this strange mission.\

\It appears that a fleet was despatched, over 30 years ago, to install a series of beacons in the region. None of the ships returned to their point of origin. It seems that this mission was called 'the Dynasty Project'. The purpose of the mission isn't yet clear, but it was evidently a massive undertaking, particular given the technological limitations of the time \u2013 it would have taken a year to complete that journey 30 years ago.\

The spokesperson was asked if the data supported the organisation's belief that Kahina Loren was innocent of the attempted assassination of Admiral Denton Patreus.

\Unfortunately there is nothing in the data that throws new light on Salom\u00e9's demise. But before she was arrested, she indicated that these three sectors were significant. We now believe that that is why she was killed.\


* Galactic News: Galactic Leaders Trade Blows
The leaders of the galaxy's three superpowers have released further statements concerning reports of mysterious spacecraft.

Emperor Arissa-Lavigny Duval, responding to the recent statement from Federal President Zachary Hudson, said:

\Once again, President Hudson has shown himself to be little more than a warmonger. I say again: we must not jump to conclusions. We have not yet acquired any reliable information about these vessels. We must be patient.\

No sooner had the Emperor made her statement than President Hudson responded. Speaking at a rally on Mars, he said:

\Some believe that aliens have infiltrated the Empire. An improbable claim? Maybe. But then again, maybe not. After all, we are almost certainly dealing with an extremely advanced species. Who knows what they are capable of?\

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon did not release a statement, but former Federal president Jasmina Halsey, who has become one of Mahon's most trusted advisors, made an announcement in which she seemed to address the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict as much as the mysterious ships:

\Understanding. Cooperation. These must be our watchwords. We have to go beyond party politics and petty point scoring. Only by working together can we hope to avoid bloodshed.\


* Galactic News: Second Colonia Appeal Concludes
The second Colonia Council migration appeal has come to an end. Hundreds of organisations took part in the campaign, delivering huge quantities of material to Jaques Station in the hope of earning a place in the Colonia Nebula.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Colonia Council said:

\We are immensely grateful to those who contributed to this appeal, which has demonstrated the galactic community's ongoing commitment to the Colonia community. The material we have received will be used in various infrastructure projects throughout the region.\

\I am aware that some pilots believe the new sites are identical to the one in Synuefe XR-H d11-102, but deeper analysis reveals that while the structures follow a set architectural pattern, the configuration of the codex-data pillars is different. This means there is probably unique data at each site, and I urge explorers to investigate the codex layouts to ensure no data is missed.\

Ram Tah also urged independent explorers to deliver any recovered data promptly, as his deciphering software can be applied to Guardian codices for only a few weeks.

* Galactic News: Halsey's Campaign Reaches Successful Conclusion
Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has announced that her campaign to establish a rehabilitation centre for victims of war has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering construction materials to Dirichlet Orbital, the campaign's centre.

As the campaign drew to a close, Jasmina Halsey released a statement:

\It is clear to me that, in the current political climate, peace cannot be achieved without practical effort. It feels so good to do something that will have a measurable impact.\

\My sincere thanks go to the many pilots who supported this campaign, and to the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry for its generous financial support.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.


* Community Goal: Peacock Patrons of Law Issue Appeal
The Peacock Patrons of Law have placed an open order for Robotics, Ion Distributors and Emergency Power Cells. The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Phillips Dock in the Peacock system.

The campaign begins on the 9th February 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Valentine's Day Appeal
Human civilisation spans hundreds of star systems and encompasses a wide range of cultures, but many people still share a number of traditions. One such tradition is Valentine's Day, a celebration of romantic love dating from the 5th Century.

With many choosing to mark the occasion by giving gifts to their significant other, retailers throughout the galaxy are preparing for a busy week. One of these retailers, Vestani Conservatives, has placed an open order for various commodities in anticipation of this hectic period. A spokesperson for the organisation said:

\We won't be able to fulfil our commercial obligations without the support of the galactic community, so we're offering generous premiums to pilots who deliver  Thrutis Cream, Deuringas Truffles and Esuseku Caviar to our headquarters at Rose Terminal in the Vestani system.\

* Galactic News: Intriguing Expedition Record Surfaces
A curious record has surfaced, detailing an apparently clandestine expedition to find relics from the lost civilisation known as the Guardians.

The record, which takes the form of a series of personal logs, indicates that the expedition was led by one Professor Melville, an authority on xeno-biology who disappeared a few months ago.

The record has attracted a considerable amount of attention, and is reprinted in full below.

13th January 3303

\I'm not just going to sit here while that jumped-up mechanic Ram Tah spoon-feeds us information.\

That's what Professor Melville said. He wanted to know more about the Guardians \u2013 maybe even figure out where they came from. So off we went, with little to go on beyond the professor's belief that there were more ruins out there.

He claims to have information that will help us find more sites, but he's keeping it close to his chest. Only he and the pilot know where we're going. It's like he's afraid someone will take credit for his discovery. We've been scanning lifeless planetoids for days, eyeballing the ground for locations.

He keeps reciting the same little speech: \Xeno-achaeology has moved on. The days of exploring the outer reaches, only occasionally finding something of value, are behind us. I have found the key.\

But I'm not an archaeologist. Professor Melville is just a means to an end. I signed up for the money.

24th January 3303

We received an update today \u2013 apparently Ram Tah has found some new sites. Melville scoffed when he heard the news. \Scraps from an amateur,\ he said. \We'll find the real secrets. Trust me.\

Trust. That's an interesting thing. Why should we trust someone who doesn't trust us? Well, maybe he has reason not to: I took a look at his records while he was talking to the pilot. I don't like being kept in the dark.

Melville thinks there could be hundreds of sites out there. His hypothesis is that the Guardians occupied an area of space similar in size to that currently inhabited by humans, but that for some reason they were forced to migrate. He believes he can find that region of space and the Guardians' point of origin.

The Guardians could well have had a huge civilisation, with hundreds of sites \u2013 maybe thousands \u2013 in this part of space. The similarities across different sites are comparable to the way we reuse certain structures. After all, how many Coriolis stations are there in the galaxy?

2nd February 3303

Melville thinks the Synuefe XR-H D11-102 system represents some kind of end point or 'last colony'. Beyond that, the sites appear in clusters, with the number of sites in each cluster getting increasingly larger. We discovered a cluster of sites only a few days ago before finding a location with an entirely unique layout. So far we've found three sites in each of the following systems: Synuefe LY-I b42-2, Synuefe NL-N c23-4 and Synuefe TP-F b44-0.

There are basically three different types of site, most of which have a different codex layout. Melville thinks that each type of site fulfilled a different function. He also thinks the Guardians were the dominant species in this region of space. But he's not content with this discovery. He wants to keep going.

Are we ever going back to turn back?

8th February 3303

This isn't a research vessel anymore \u2013 it's a prison. All means of communicating with the rest of the galaxy have been disabled. Melville has taken control of ship. His obsession has doomed us all.

I'm transmitting these records in the hope that someone finds them and comes to our rescue. But the chances of that are slim.

Ruchbah Industry

Junga Patron's Principles

Junga Interstellar

Liberty Party of Zeessze

Zeessze Clan

Luyten 674-15 Industries

People's Changthini for Equality

Civil wars occur when minor factions compete for control of major assets such as starports. When a faction is involved in a civil war, the standard of living, development level and security level in the system it controls are temporarily reduced. Combat activities can bring a civil war to an end.

Here are the latest factions to experience war:

AG+21 1754 Citizen Party

Kini Drug Empire

Labour of Ethgreze

Kokary Liberals

GCRV 4654 State Interstellar

Ross 754 Labour

Mother Gaia

Independents of Mildeptu

Quator Ring

Wars occur when a minor faction invades a star system controlled by another minor faction. For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report
This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions.

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State

Brotherhood of Caerete

Jaques

HIP 5712 Guardians of Tradition

Friends of Kotigen

Defence Party of NLTT 57668

League of Ross 1015

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal:

Limapa Blue State Commodities

Coquim Industry

Zugen Incorporated

Durius Dominion

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party

HR 8170 Brotherhood

HIP 13269 Silver Drug Empire

Regulatory State of Kausan

Lao Zi Blue Fortune Corp.

Imenhit Limited

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.


* Galactic News: Ram Tah Makes Breakthrough
Since the Synuefe ruins were discovered in October, hundreds of explorers, archaeologists and relic hunters have scoured the site for information about the race that created it. When engineer Ram Tah started researching the ruins, hundreds more joined the search, motivated either by a thirst for knowledge or by the promise of reward.

Now, Ram Tah claims to have made a significant breakthrough. In a statement, he said:

\Thanks to the hard work of many dedicated pilots \u2013 and in particular Commander Noodlz05 and his wingmates \u2013 I have isolated a signal in the Guardians' monolith network that will allow scanners to identify sites within 1,000 light seconds. This should make finding further Guardian ruins considerably easier.\

\I would like to thank all those involved for their help. This was not an easy task, but together we have learned a great deal about the Guardians' fascinating culture.\

* Galactic News: United Sutekh Future Operation Succeeds
A spokesperson for United Sutekh Future has announced that the organisation has triumphed over the Adad Exchange in the Sutekh system.

The conflict began when the Adad Exchange attempted to plunder the remains of a Federal convoy for sensitive military intelligence. When United Sutekh Future learned of the plan, it launched an offensive against the Adad Exchange, eager to prevent the intelligence from falling into enemy hands.

Both campaigns received the support of hundreds of independent pilots, but ultimately it was United Sutekh Future that emerged victorious. A spokesperson for the organisation thanked those who supported its operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Archemides Gateway in the Sutekh system.

An Alliance spokesperson has announced that a Naval convoy has been attacked in the Rahu system. The spokesperson also confirmed that criminals have begun targeting the convoy with the intention of taking escape pods from the wreckage. They went on to say:

\These criminals have just one aim: to abduct Alliance personnel and sell them into illegal slavery. We cannot allow these vile opportunists to take our comrades captive.\

\We are therefore asking pilots to recover escape pods from the wreckage and deliver them to Acharya Station in Rahu. We have also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, in support of the rescue operation.\

The race, which is between Leopold Heckmann Ring in the Malaikudi system and Evans Port in Parutis, requires competitors to navigate a series of tunnels at various scientific and military installations en route. Bonuses will be awarded depending on ship size, meaning some very large ships will be squeezed through some very tight spaces.

The Buckyball Racing Club refused to address rumours that the race will use Federal and Imperial capital ship docks as gates.

The event starts on Saturday the 25th of February and will run until Monday the 6th of March.

For the duration of the war, the standard of living, wealth level and security level in the disputed system are reduced. Combat activity between the two warring factions determines the outcome of the conflict. If neither faction succeeds in dominating the other, the war ends in a ceasefire.


* Galactic News: Theft at Darnielle's Progress
A carefully orchestrated heist, involving the theft of a large quantity of meta-alloys, has taken place at Darnielle's Progress in the Maia system.

Security personnel at the starport confirmed that an unidentified Cobra-class vessel was involved in the robbery. After the ship docked at the starport, the pilot and four other passengers disembarked before the ship was serviced and refuelled.

Later, the pilot requisitioned the largest available quota of meta-alloys, whereupon the automated units inexplicably loaded it to maximum capacity. The Cobra immediately departed, breaking speed limits and ignoring hails.

Attempts were made to track the ship, but no trace of it was found.

Investigations are ongoing. Pilots are asked to report any sightings of a Cobra with the callsign 'lima uniform charlie'.


* Galactic News: Asteroid Destroyed in HIP 16497
Earlier this week, automated stellar probes in the HIP 16497 system picked up an unusual heat signature. Local explorers promptly launched an investigation, only to discover that an asteroid had inexplicably disappeared from the system.

\It's most peculiar,\ said Kate Panamen of the Mars High Astrocartography Institute. \Given the asteroid's orbit, it shouldn't have come into contact with anything in the system for aeons. Nevertheless, the investigators found an expanding cloud of dust in the asteroid's supposed location. We're at a loss to explain how it could have been destroyed.\

Both Federal and Imperial sources denied rumours that the destruction of the asteroid was a result of experimental weapon testing.

* Galactic News: Rahu Operation comes to an End
An Alliance spokesperson has announced that its operation to the crew of an Alliance convoy from opportunistic slavers in the Rahu system has reached a successful conclusion.

Hundreds of independent pilots supported the campaign by recovering escape pods from the remains of the convoy and delivering them safely to Acharya Station. Meanwhile, combat pilots neutralised slavers who were attempting to take escape pods from the wreckage.

As the operation drew to a close, an Alliance spokesperson made a brief statement:

\We are immeasurably grateful to the galactic community for its support. Countless members of Alliance personnel have been spared a lifetime of enforced slavery, and we have you to thank for it.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Acharya Station in the Rahu system.


* Community Goal: Loren's Legion Issues Request
Loren's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Prism system, has placed an open order for tantalum.

The organisation has a wide range of business interests, and regularly supplies commercial entities with raw materials and other commodities. On this occasion it has turned to the galactic community for help fulfilling its commitments.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a statement to the media.

\We have experienced a huge spike in demand, and our facility at Hiram's Anchorage is already running at full capacity, so to satisfy our clients we will need the help of the galactic community. Fortunately we are in a position to offer generous premiums to pilots who deliver tantalum to Hiram's Anchorage in the Prism system.\

The campaign begins on the 2nd of March 3303 and will run for two weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

\We need two resources to start construction \u2013 military grade fabrics and platinum \u2013 and we encourage all able and willing Commanders to assist us.\

\Resistance is expected, but the Military Militia and its allies stand at the ready. We will be patrolling the shipping lanes in order to keep criminals at bay and ensure no crime goes unpunished.\

The proposed installation, which will be known as Soldiers' Respite, will boast state-of-the-art communication relays, high-tech weapon systems and a combat training facility.

* Galactic News: Perpetrators of Darnielle's Progress Heist Identified
Three of the five individuals responsible for the recent theft of meta-alloys from Darnielle's Progress have been positively identified, following analysis of starport security footage. Remarkably, one of the perpetrators has been acknowledged as Commander Salom\u00e9, also known as Kahina Tijani Loren.

Loren was sentenced to life imprisonment last year for the attempted murder of Admiral Denton Patreus, but when her convoy was destroyed en route to Koontz Asylum it was assumed she had been killed.

Responding to the news, Imperial authorities promptly placed a galaxy-wide bounty on Salom\u00e9 to the tune of 500,000 credits.

Meanwhile, Princess Aisling Duval released a brief statement:

\Commander Salom\u00e9 is a disgraced senator and a convicted murderer. She incites violence wherever she goes, and in the interest of public safety she must be stopped. I urge all those loyal to the Empire to deliver justice to this criminal.\

Salom\u00e9's accomplices have been identified as former MetaDrive employee Raan Corsen \u2013 previously believed deceased \u2013 and former Junior Alliance operative Tsu Annabelle Singh. The Empire has placed sizeable bounties on both individuals.

Imperial military sources issued the following advice to those interested in pursuing these bounties:

\These individuals should be considered armed and dangerous. Make no attempt to communicate with them. Shoot on sight. Visual evidence of a target's death will guarantee the relevant bounty.\

Salom\u00e9's current location is unknown, but she is believed to have fled the core systems.

* Galactic News: Empire Expands into the Pleiades
Recent reports indicate that the Empire has expanded into the Pleiades star cluster, having established a number of outposts in the HR 1185 system.

Katherine Ryder, a freelance journalist and seasoned war correspondent, commented on the development:

\Things might have been quiet recently, but that doesn't mean the situation with the Empire and the Federation has improved. This is a cold war, after all.\

\Regardless of claims to the contrary, this conflict is about one thing: meta-alloys. Both sides want Maia and Merope because of the barnacles they contain, and both sides will keep pushing into those systems.\

\Eventually, one of two things will happen: one side will withdraw...or neither side will. In the latter scenario, war seems inevitable.\

Politicians on both sides of the divide have urged the superpowers to engage in amicable talks and establish some kind of agreement over the meta-alloys, but such entreaties have so far fallen on deaf ears.

The pilots pledging to support the disgraced senator are offering escort services and fuel, and have even promised to reward other Commanders willing to help.

\The issue is that we are not in possession of the facts,\ said Commander Jayridium, who is offering up to 50 times the listed bounty to anyone who can arrange a meeting with Salom\u00e9. \I am joining the effort to protect her. The truth must be heard!\

* Galactic News: Halsey's Campaign Concludes
Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has announced that her campaign to provide relief for those at Dirichlet Orbital has been a resounding success. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating agitators in Yum Kamcabi and delivering supplies to the starport.

As the campaign drew to a close, Jasmina Halsey released a statement:

\This was a huge humanitarian effort on behalf of thousands of refugees caught in the crossfire of war. I cannot thank the contributing pilots enough. I know they have the gratitude of every man, woman and child at Dirichlet Orbital.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.


* Community Goal: The Colonia Expansion
The Colonia Council has launched its fifth migration appeal, giving the galaxy's minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula.

A spokesperson for the council explained the nature of the initiative:

\Once again we are asking pilots to deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation, in order to earn a migration visa.\

\At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for each organisation's sole use.\

The campaign begins on the 6th of April 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Gandii in Chaos

This is not the first time the Gandii Justice Party has traded blows with the Hand Gang of Gandii, although the scale of the conflict dwarfs that of previous skirmishes.

Security forces in Gandii released the following statement:

\Our operatives have confirmed that both factions are offering privateer bonds to combat pilots who support their cause. But naturally we do not condone any course of action that could escalate, or perpetuate, this conflict.\

Both the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Gandii Justice Party have set out week-long operations to overcome their rivals, which will begin on the 6th of April 3303.

* Galactic News: Alien Tsar Makes Statement
It has now been several months since the galaxy's superpowers commented on the mysterious spacecraft seen throughout human-inhabited space.

Some members of the galactic community have publicly wondered why the galaxy's political leaders are keeping silent, but political commentators have been quick to point out that in the absence of concrete information, it is perhaps prudent to refrain from discussion.

But it seems that, behind closed doors, the superpowers are taking the issue very seriously.

A spokesperson for the Federal Navy has announced that Admiral Aden Tanner, a seasoned military leader with over four decades of experience, has been appointed to the newly created role of Chief of Federal Security. Although the Federation has not elaborated on Admiral Tanner's precise remit, an inaugural statement from the admiral suggests he has been ordered to investigate the mysterious ships, prompting media outlets to nickname him 'the alien tsar'.

In his statement, Admiral Tanner said:

\Having reviewed all available information, we can confirm these craft are active primarily within the Pleiades Nebula and the space in and around the Maia and Merope systems. The significance of these locations \u2013 if any \u2013 has not yet been determined. We can also confirm, despite rumours to the contrary, that carrying an Unknown Artefact does not attract the attention of these vessels.\

\A number of independent pilots claim to have seen evidence that these ships have attacked human vessels, but no empirical verification has been recovered. Nevertheless, I would urge the galactic community to treat these strange ships with extreme caution.\

Admiral Tanner declined to answer questions from media representatives, saying only, \When we know more, you'll know more\.

* Galactic News: Message Received from Col 70 Sector
A weak signal from the Col 70 Sector has been detected by listening posts in both Federal and Imperial space.

The message is incomplete, but it appears to pertain to some kind of rally point. Meanwhile, Federal and Imperial intelligence services have confirmed that thousands of covert and coded messages have recently been transmitted in the vicinity of the Col 70 Sector.

\Something is going on out there,\ said an unidentified member of the Imperial intelligence community. \We think it could be...her.\

A bounty has been issued for Commanders Salom\u00e9, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Raan Corsen, but with all three fugitives still at large, the Empire has increased the bounties to five million for Salom\u00e9 and two million apiece for Singh and Corsen. An Imperial spokesperson reiterated that pilots should not attempt to communicate with these individuals, and should shoot on sight.

Imperial intelligence services have also placed a bounty on one Commander Yuri Nakamura, referred to as 'Conformist Oboe XX' in an intelligence briefing given to the media. A two- million-credit bounty has been placed on Commander Nakamura.


* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Union of Wolf 359 Labour

Cemiess Commodities

Coquim Industry

Eravate Network

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions

AG+21 1754 Citizen Party

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Brotherhood of LP 98-132

Ngaliba Blue Camorra

Lords of Ngaliba

Potriti Gold Mafia

Morgor Crimson Pirates

Keries Camorra

Aleutes Bureau

League of 36 Ursae Majoris

Mehnemine Free

* Community Goal: Colonia Resource Drive
It has now been eight months since the first Colonia outpost was established, and since then the colony has gone from strength to strength.

With the Colonia community continuing to expand, the Colonia Co-operative has placed an open order for mined Gallite, Gold and Methanol Monohydrate Crystals for the development of infrastructure throughout Colonia and the surrounding systems.

A spokesperson for the Colonia Co-operative released a statement:

\It would be impossible to overstate how many resources are needed to sustain and grow the Colonia community. Suffice it to say that we are in constant need. Fortunately, thanks to a series of corporate donations, we are in a position to offer generous premiums to pilots who deliver materials to Colonia Dream in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-76 system.\

The campaign begins on the 13th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Utopia Research Appeal
The Utopia Commune has issued a request for various commodities to be used in a forthcoming research and development programme.

The enclave has placed an open order for zirconium, conductive ceramics and strange wake solutions, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Cenker City in the Gucumadhyas system.

Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of the Utopian movement, released a statement outlining the nature of the initiative.

\We are well aware that independent pilots accumulate large quantities of material over the course of their travels. Fortunately, Utopia is willing to pay above-market prices for these materials, which will play a central role in our forthcoming programme.\

The campaign begins on the 13th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Order Restored in Gandii

A group of EM-transmission technology enthusiasts in the Tionisla system claims to have found a message in the exploration data gathered last year as part of a campaign organised by the Children of Raxxla.

A spokesperson for the group, which calls itself The Hamsters, said:

« It was inside one of the beacon modulator wave harmonics, and it seems to be some sort of rhyme. We've studied it but have come up with nothing, so we thought we'd share it with the galactic community. »

The message is reprinted in full below.

A spokesperson for the Utopia Commune has announced that its campaign for materials has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the initiative by delivering various commodities to Cenker City, which will be used in a forthcoming research and development programme.

As the campaign drew to a close, Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, issued a brief statement.

« Those who contributed to this initiative have my gratitude. Thanks to you, this programme is off to a promising start. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cenker City in the Gucumadhyas system.

The Colonia Co-operative has thanked those who contributed to the campaign, and invited them to collect their rewards from Colonia Dream in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-76 system.


* Community Goal: Superpower Expansion
For several months, the Maia system has been a focal point in the ongoing hostility between the Empire and the Federation.

Now, the Empire and the Federation have announced plans to expand their presence in Maia by constructing new outposts. But with a shortage of reliable supply lines into the system, the superpowers are relying on the galactic community for help in compiling the necessary materials. Both are keenly aware that the finite nature of resources and support means only one will be able to proceed with its plans.

Both the Empire and the Federation have promised to reward pilots who contribute construction materials to their respective campaigns. The Federal campaign is being coordinated by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, while the Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been authorised to oversee the Imperial initiative.

The rival campaigns begin on the 20th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If either faction achieves its aims earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Alliance Continues California Nebula Expansion
Last year, the Alliance established a foothold in the California Nebula with the construction of an outpost in the California Sector BA-A E6 system.

Critics of the superpower suggested it was trying to control the system's barnacles, but the Alliance insisted the outpost was intended solely to support scientific research.

Now, fresh reports indicate that the Alliance is about to expand its presence in the region by establishing both a scientific outpost and an extraction facility in California Sector JH-V c2-12.

Kelvin Masters, a freelance journalist who regularly contributes to the Rewired news feed, commented on the development:

« Of course the Alliance wants the barnacles! They'd never admit it, of course. But that's not the point. The point is what are the Empire and Federation going to do about it. At the moment they're preoccupied with Maia and Merope, but sooner or later they're going to turn their attention to the California Nebula. And when that happens, the situation is going to escalate, I guarantee it. »

* Freelance Report: Formidine Rift Discovery
A few days ago, a curious message was discovered by the Hamsters, a group of EM-transmission enthusiasts in the Tionisla system. A short time later, a combined effort from the Children of Raxxla and several other groups decoded the message and discovered it pointed to the Syreadiae JX-F c0 system in the so-called Formidine Rift.

Travelling to the system, pilots discovered a bulk cruiser called the Zurara. The ship's logs painted a haunting picture, indicating that the ship's crew sabotaged the vessel before killing themselves. The Zurara had been adrift in the system ever since.

As the campaign drew to a close, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval released a brief statement, thanking those who supported the initiative. It is expected that work on the new outpost will begin imminently.

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Community Goal: The Gear of War
The Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces have announced plans to fortify their home system of Sitakapa by converting a mining outpost into a military settlement. The move is a response to increasing political and military instability across the galaxy.

General Ani Leonard of Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces announced:

\Our galaxy becomes more dangerous every day. Whether it's the Federation sowing unrest in the Pleiades, fringe-terrorism from Salom\u00e8 and her lackeys or hyperdictions from unknown parties, the risks are greater than they've ever been. And the frontier colonies are most at risk. We must be prepared.\

General Leonard promised that contractors who deliver military-grade weapons and chemicals to Russell Hub will earn a cut of Sitakapa's booming wealth \u2013 the result of years of economic development.

The campaign begins on the 27th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Restoring Order in Cartoq

* Galactic News: Federal-Imperial Conflict in Merope
Authorities in the Merope system have reported conflict between the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, a Federal organisation, and the Merope Expeditionary Fleet, an Imperial organisation. The clash represents the latest development in the ongoing proxy war between the Empire and the Federation.

Significantly, the two factions were until recently embroiled in conflict in the Maia system. It is understood the Pleiades Resource Enterprise withdrew from the conflict specifically so it could engage Merope Expeditionary Fleet forces in Merope. This has led to speculation that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise was ordered to enter Merope and by the Federation.

Security forces in Merope have confirmed that the fighting is localised at present, with no significant impact on civilian settlements.

Freelance journalist Katherine Ryder commented on the development:

« As long as the fighting remains contained, there's no cause for alarm. There's a world of difference between inter-faction skirmishes and all-out war between the galaxy's two largest superpowers. Full-scale conflict between the Empire and the Federation might never happen. »

* Galactic News: Generation Ship Found
Before the development of faster-than-light travel, colonising distant star systems depended on vast interstellar arks known as generation ships. There are believed to be more than 70,000 of these ships in the galaxy, the location of many of which is not known.

But now one of these 'lost' ships has been found. A transmission recovered from a listening post in the LHS 1047 system led a pair of independent pilots to the Alaunus system, where the generation ship 'Lycaor' was discovered. Tragically, it appears that the ship's crew was killed by an unidentified pathogen, no doubt many centuries ago. This was confirmed by remotely accessing the ship's medical logs.

System authorities have urged pilots not to interfere with the vessel, which is still protected by the legislature instated at the time of its launch.

* Galactic News: Terrorist Salom\u00e9 Killed
Imperial despatches have confirmed that Commander Salom\u00e9, also known as Kahina Tijani Loren, was killed in the Arumclaw system on the 29th of April by a bounty hunter known as 'Besieger'.

Salom\u00e9 was escorted by several heavily armed vessels, but her Imperial Clipper 'Seven Veils' was nevertheless destroyed by weapons fire. Three commanders were seen fleeing Arumclaw shortly afterwards.

Surveillance reports indicate that Salom\u00e9's co-conspirators \u2013 Raan Corsen, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Yuri Nakamura \u2013 remain at large.

Moments after Salom\u00e9's destruction was confirmed, a transmission was detected in the Teorge system, leading to the discovery of a series of logs. The logs, which apparently date from 3275, contain nebulous assertions regarding a scheme from an unidentified super organisation to manipulate the Empire, Federation and Alliance.

A number of factions tried to defend Salom\u00e9 and her allies as they travelled from 46 Eridani to the core systems. Imperial intelligence is reportedly trying to identify the factions that supported the conspirators, but anecdotal reports indicate that many have already fallen into disarray in the wake of Salom\u00e9's death.

« She was a force of evil who attempted to sow the seeds of conflict among those who strive for peace, » said Princess Aisling Duval. « Her warmongering is at an end, and the galaxy is now a safer place. It's just a shame that so many innocent lives were lost before she was brought down. »

Admiral Denton Patreus refused to address claims that the bounty hunter was in his employ, saying only, « Let that be an end to this sorry affair ».

Figures from the worlds of politics, commerce and culture are scheduled to convene at KatherineB for what is promised to be \an event of unparalleled opulence\.

With the event scheduled to take place next week, the Zeus Bureau has placed an open order for a range of luxury goods, promising to reward those who deliver these commodities to KatherineB in the Zeus system.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:

\Some of the most powerful people in the galaxy will attend this event, so it is of the utmost importance that our guests want for nothing. We have therefore placed open orders for Giant Irukama Snails, Kamitra Cigars and Lavian Brandy.

The Colonia region is a popular emigration destination, but entry is carefully controlled by the system's governing body, the Colonia Council. Evidently, the system's latest residents are unconcerned with the Council's processes.

With the Colonia community still at an early stage and lacking a comprehensive security force, it is relying on the galaxy's independent combat pilots for military support. The Junkyard Dogs has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in  Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Tolagarf's Junkjard.

* Galactic News: Halsey Stages Anti-War Protest
Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey held a public demonstration in the Alioth system yesterday in protest of the ongoing conflict between the Empire and the Federation.

More than 30,000 people attended the event, which lasted for several hours and occupied one of the main public plazas in Nerah City on Argent's Claim.

A number of high-profile speakers and activists addressed the crowd, although Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was notable by his absence. Political commentators were quick to point out, however, that the demonstration could not have taken place without his foreknowledge, if not his explicit approval.

In an address to the crowd, Halsey said:

« As a 20th Century historian once wrote, 'The underlying reason for war is always economic.' This conflict has nothing to do with freedom or liberation \u2013 it is about resources. And I believe enough people have died to line the pockets of already wealthy individuals in the Federation and the Empire. »

« I speak now directly to President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval: It is not too late for you to listen to reason. »

Neither the Empire nor the Federation elected to respond to Halsey's statement.

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

Brotherhood of LP 98-132

Lords of Ngaliba

Over the past few days, news feeds in the Varati system have provided extensive coverage of the maiden voyage of the Gnosis, a scientific-research vessel commissioned by the Canonn Interstellar Research Group.

The state-of-the art ship is the result of a community initiative that saw the public contribute huge quantities of material. In fact, the response from the galactic community was so positive that construction was completed ahead of schedule.

The ship has now taken up position in orbit around Varati A6, and has already begun welcoming visitors and dignitaries from the core systems.

* Community Goal: Superpower Expansion
In recent weeks, both the Empire and the Federation have accelerated their expansion plans in the Maia and Merope systems, deploying dozens of ships and establishing a number of outposts. The latest phase of these campaigns will see both superpowers constructing bases in the Pleiades region.

The Empire has authorised the Merope Expeditionary Fleet to coordinate its campaign, while the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has agreed to oversee the Federal appeal. Both organisations have placed open orders for construction materials, promising to reward pilots who deliver tantalum, building fabricators and thermal cooling units to their respective bases of operation \u2013 PRE Logistics Support Gamma for the Federal campaign and Moni's Hub for the Imperial initiative.

Both campaigns begin on the 25th of May and will run for one week. If either the Empire or the Federation meets its targets earlier than planned, its campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Order Restored in Colonia
A spokesperson for the Colonia Council has announced that the agitators causing discord in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 system have been eliminated. Hundreds of pilots supported the operation, taking to their ships to tackle the criminals that had taken root in system. The Junkyard Dogs have also confirmed that security personnel have been stationed at the agitators' outposts to prevent reoccupation.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Junkyard Dogs released a statement:

« Colonia is more than just a system \u2013 it is a symbol. It cannot be allowed to fall into a quagmire of criminality and corruption like so many of the core systems. It must be protected. The pilots who purged Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 of the criminals infesting it have our everlasting gratitude. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Tolagarf's Junkjard.


* Galactic News: Zeus Bureau Appeal Concludes
A spokesperson for the Zeus Bureau has announced that its appeal for luxury goods has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of tonnes of commodities were delivered to KatherineB over the week, following an enthusiastic response from the galactic community.

As the initiative drew to a close, the organisation released a statement:

« Every pilot who responded to our appeal has our sincerest gratitude. Thanks to you, the event was an unalloyed triumph. »

Reports indicate that the event's success has already had a positive impact on the economy of Zeus, as evidenced by the fact that The Midas, a Wells-class carrier, has relocated to the system. It is hoped that the vessel will remain in the region to serve as a commercial hub.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from KatherineB in the Zeus system.

* Community Goal: The Battle for Jotunheim
Recent reports from Jotunheim indicate that the Autocracy of Jotunheim, an Imperial-aligned organisation, has entered the system with a remit to bring it under Imperial control.

Regional authorities have opposed the incursion, and have authorised the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim from the system. The Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance has also issued a call to independent combat pilots for support, promising to reward those who lend their aid. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has issued a similar plea.

Meanwhile, peace activist Jasmina Halsey has surprised commentators by placing an open order for performance enhancers, armour and military grade fabrics, which she has pledged to donate to the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance in support of its operation. The Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry is coordinating Halsey's appeal.

Anticipating the furore her decision would cause, Halsey released the following statement:

« I know I will be criticised for intervening in this conflict. But if those who oppose this war believe it can be stopped through peaceful protest alone, they are mistaken. If we do not help the people of Jotunheim, they will lose their homeland. We cannot stand idly by. »

All three campaigns begin on the 1st of June 3303 and will run for one week. If any of the factions involved meets its targets earlier than planned, its campaign will end immediately.

Over the past year, the Qa'wakana system has become a focal point for the Knights of Karma, a rapidly expanding organisation that has attracted support from across the galaxy. Now the group has announced plans to establish a new mining facility among the rings of Qa'wakana 6.

A spokesman for the organisation released a statement regarding the proposal.

« Plans for the facility are underway, but we will need the support of the galactic community if the project is to succeed. We are therefore offering generous remuneration to pilots who deliver construction materials to Carpini Terminal in the Qa'wakana system. »

The spokesperson added that the organisation had placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list.

« The construction of this new facility is sure to aggravate those who want to preserve the status quo, and we are expecting resistance. So we're asking combat pilots to help us protect innocent traders from persecution. »

The campaign begins on the 8th of June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Conflict in Jotunheim Draws to a Close
Authorities in Jotunheim have announced that the operation to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim from the system has succeeded.

Both factions issued calls for support, and hundreds of independent combat pilots responded, but ultimately the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance emerged victorious. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has now withdrawn from the system.

The success of the resistance operation was due in no small part to the support of Jasmina Halsey. Scores of pilots responded to her request for commodities, which were then donated to Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance.

As the conflict drew to a close, representatives of the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance and the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry thanked those who supported their operations.

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Big Harry's Monkey Hangout in the Jotunheim system.

* Community Goal: Further Superpower Expansion
As the Empire and Federation continue to consolidate their presence in the Pleiades star cluster, both superpowers have announced new expansion initiatives centred in the region.

The Empire has declared its intention to bolster its Navy with a new Well-class Carrier, one of the largest vessels of its kind, while the Federation has announced plans to establish an asteroid base among the rings of HIP 17692 A4 in the HIP 17692 system.

Both superpowers have placed open orders for construction materials, promising to reward those who support their respective campaigns. The Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been authorised to coordinate the Imperial campaign, while the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has agreed to oversee the Federal initiative.

Both campaign begin on the 15th of June 3303 and will run for one week. If either superpower meets its targets earlier than planned, its campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Knights of Karma Appeal Concludes
The Knights of Karma have announced that their plan to establish a new mining facility in the Qa'wakana system has been warmly received by the galactic community. The organisation's targets for materials have been met, and work on the new facility is expected to start soon.

A spokesman for the Knights of Karma released a statement:

« This is a landmark day for the people of Qa'wakana. The cost of the construction materials will be recouped from the minerals mined at the new facility, and local markets will be able to realise their full potential. The pilots who assisted us have our everlasting gratitude. »

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Carpini Terminal in the Qa'wakana system.


* Galactic News: The Thargoids have Returned
Over the past few days, media streams have been abuzz with news that the so-called Unknown Ships are in fact Thargoid vessels, as many had speculated. The Federal Times, having spent several days confirming sources and authenticating reports, has now published an in-depth account of the events that led to the revelation.

It is understood that Professor Ishmael Palin, a leading authority on xenobiological research, determined the vessels' origin by comparing data from the Unknown Ships with older Thargoid samples. Palin's experiments resulted in conclusive proof that the Unknown Ships were Thargoid.

A short time later, Palin's data was seized by Federal agents, who attempted to convey it to a Federal research facility. But in a shocking turn of events, the ship carrying the data was attacked en route to its destination. There is strong evidence to suggest the attack was executed by Thargoid vessels.

The incapacitation of the Federal vessel resulted in the information entering the public domain. But the cryptic nature of the data meant that The Federal Times was compelled to conduct further research before publishing its report.

In its story, The Federal Times also posited that the barnacles may be of Thargoid origin, given their relationship with the Thargoid ships. But it stopped short of suggesting a link between the Thargoids and the Unknown Probes and Artefacts, which many also believe to be nonhuman objects.

Meanwhile, the public mood was best summarised by Kelvin Masters, a freelance journalist, who contributed the following to the Rewired news feed:

« Look at the history books. Every time we've met the Thargoids, there's bloodshed. We need to prepare for the worst. I mean, they've already attacked human ships! What kind of contingencies do the superpowers have in place? And what do we know about the Thargoids' capabilities? What kind of weapons do they have? What kind of defences? And why did the Federation take Palin's data? Were they trying to keep it quiet? These questions need to be answered! »

The leaders of the galaxy's three superpowers are expected to make statements shortly.

* Galactic News: Galactic Leaders Address Thargoid Discovery
The leaders of the galaxy's major powers have responded to news that the mysterious ships seen in the Maia system and Pleiades Nebula are Thargoid vessels.

Federal President Zachary Hudson released a characteristically forthright statement.

« Earlier this year, I said I would rather prepare for an attack that may not come than be met by an attack I did not prepare for. Well, the Federation has not been idle. For months, we have been expanding our Navy in preparation for just such a day. Some, such as Edmund Mahon, believe this is unnecessary. But perhaps Mr Mahon has not read the reports of Federal ships being attacked by Thargoid vessels. If the Thargoids want a fight, it's a fight they'll get. »

Addressing the media from the Imperial Palace on Capitol, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

« The facts are these: the Thargoids have highly sophisticated starships, they have a relationship with the organic constructs, and they have the means to remotely disable human spacecraft. In some quarters, these facts have given rise to concern. But I urge you not to panic. The human race has surmounted countless challenges in the past, and created a civilisation that spans hundreds of star systems. Do not be too quick to discount the human race. »

Finally, Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon released the following statement:

« Our next steps must be taken with great care. Despite President Hudson's claims to the contrary, there is no proof that the Thargoids have attacked Federal vessels. We must not assume the Thargoids are hostile. Theirs is clearly an intelligent and technologically sophisticated race. There is a great deal we could learn from them. »

Doctor Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has issued a statement from the Gnosis concerning the recent discovery that the so-called Unknown Ships are in fact of Thargoid origin.

« Finally, the Thargoids have revealed themselves, moving from the shadows into the starlight. We cannot predict where this road will lead, but surely there is no way back. We stand at a precipice, staring into the abyss...yet we can take some comfort from the fact that humanity has faced this threat before and prevailed. »

« The first reports of Unknown Artefacts \u2013 riddles in space \u2013 now seem so long ago. How could we have known it would come to this? »

« Rest assured that should the worst happen, should governments fall and our civilisation be shaken to its very foundations, Canonn will stand against the darkness. »

* Galactic News: Superpower Campaigns End
Last week, the Empire and the Federation launched initiatives designed to bolster their presences in the Pleiades star cluster.

Both superpowers placed open orders for construction materials for use in their respective campaigns, and the response from the galactic community was overwhelmingly positive. Huge quantities of material were delivered to Obsidian Orbital for both the Federal campaign and the Imperial initiative.

It seems that despite widespread opposition to the Federal-Imperial conflict, both superpowers still enjoy considerable support among the galactic community.

The Merope Expeditionary Fleet, which coordinated the Imperial initiative, and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which oversaw the Federal campaign, have extended their gratitude to their supporters.

Pilots who contributed to the initiatives can now collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Community Goal: Colonia Expansion Initiative
As the Colonia community continues to grow, the Junkyard Dogs have placed an open order for various commodities to support another wave of expansion.

A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed the materials would be used to construct new outposts in the region. The amount of materials received will determine exactly how many outposts are built.

The Junkyard Dogs have promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum, power generators and silver to their base of operations at Tolagarf's Junkyard.

The campaign begins on the 22nd of June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Renowned Chef Issues Appeal
Celebrated chef and culinary scholar Dr Cordelius Swainn has issued an appeal to the galactic community for rare goods for one of his famous celebrity soir\u00e9es

« I create unique dining experiences for the wealthiest patrons and most important dignitaries to visit the Lave system. I will be hosting another of these events in a few weeks for one of my most important clients, and am therefore seeking rare commodities from across the galaxy. But it is not only food I require \u2013 I am in need of a wealth of exotic goods, all of which will contribute to overall ambience. »

The appeal is being financed by Dr Swainn's corporate partner, Lave Incorporated, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested commodities to Lave Station.

* Galactic News: Colonia Population Boom
The latest census data from Colonia indicates that the system has seen a massive influx of immigrants in recent weeks. Although precise details have not been made public, it is understood that many of the region's new citizens are from the core systems.

The spike follows the introduction of a migration subsidy from the Colonia Council, which has made it much cheaper for potential immigrants to reach Colonia. Sources close to the Council have confirmed that the move was designed to stimulate economic growth by attracting skilled workers to the region.

The Colonia colony was founded almost a year ago, and since then it has expanded rapidly. For some, it represents an alternative to the violence and political disharmony they believe has come to characterise life in the core systems.

Social and political experts have predicted that as long as the Federal-Imperial conflict persists, the Colonia community will continue to grow.

* Galactic News: Thargoid Structures Discovered
As the galaxy reels from the revelation that the Thargoids have returned to human space, reports have been received that a number of independent pilots have discovered huge Thargoid structures in the Pleiades Sector OS-U c2-7, Col 285 Sector CV-Y d57, Aries Dark Region DB-X d1-63, HIP 19026, and HIP 14909 systems.

Initial reports indicate that the structures are many hundreds of metres in diameter, and consist of a number of organic-shaped elements surrounding a central edifice. There is a clear visual relationship between the structures and the Thargoid vessels sighted in the Pleiades star cluster.

Even more remarkable are reports that the structures encompass large subsurface complexes, accessed via the central edifice. Drone-like machines have also been seen roving the sites.

Professor Ishmael Palin, who played a central role in identifying the so-called Unknown Ships as Thargoid, commented on the discovery:

« This is a remarkable development, and one that raises many questions. What is the purpose of these structures? Are there others out there? And what about the drones? Are they being controlled remotely, or are they autonomous? »

« With each new discovery, we revise our perception of humanity and its place within the cosmos. »

A spokesperson for the Pilots Federation has announced a new peacekeeping initiative centred on the LHS 3447, Eravate and Asellus Primus systems. The purpose of the initiative is to minimise criminal activity in these regions and thereby ensure the safety of inexperienced pilots.

The spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

« Many of the galaxy's independent pilots start their careers in these systems, and we believe they should be able operate without fear of being targeted by opportunistic aggressors. »

« Of course, pilots will not be the only beneficiaries of this initiative \u2013 the people of LHS 3447, Eravate and Asellus Primus will also benefit from the increase in security. »

Authorities in the pertinent systems have responded positively to the proposal, with Governor Mandelbaum, administrator of Cleve Hub, describing it as « a boon to our people ». They have also expressed hope that the success of the initiative will allow peacekeeping forces to maintain order once the campaign is over.

The Pilots Federation has called on the galaxy's independent combat pilots for support, and has authorised Adle's Armada, LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co, and Asellus Primus Gold Legal Ind. to reward those who support the initiative.

* Freelance Report: Fragile Unity in Federal Congress
Following disturbing reports of attacks on Federal ships in the Pleiades Nebula, the partisan rancour that often characterises Federal Congress has faded into the background as both Republican and Liberal members of congress rally around President Zachary Hudson. Rumours that the attacks were perpetrated by the Thargoids abound, prompting calls for increased military spending.

Emerging in the wake of the no-confidence vote that resulted in the expulsion of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey, the bellicose Hudson administration was seen by many as emblematic of the Federation's uncertain path into the 34th century. But the possibility of an alien incursion is rapidly smoothing over the political sore points.

Shadow President Felicia Winters has been careful to neither endorse nor condemn Hudson's militaristic rhetoric. Meanwhile, both the Republican and Liberal parties have remained silent on the post-presidential career of Jasmina Halsey, whose advocacy for galactic peace contrasts sharply with the hawkish leader who ordered planetary bombardments against onionhead growers in the Kappa Fornacis system. In the political press, attention has focused on the fact that Halsey has become a close confidante of Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon \u2013 another moderate voice on the intergalactic stage.

Professor Ishmael Palin, leading authority on xeno-biological research, has commented on the discovery of functional technology at the Thargoid structures.

« This revelation is significant not only because it gives us an insight into Thargoid technology, but because it confirms the long-posited connection between the Thargoids and the Unknown Artefacts and Probes. Unfortunately, we still do not know the exact purpose of these pieces of technology. Reconnaissance, surveillance, cartography? The specifics elude us, even while fresh discoveries are made. »

Meanwhile, Ram Tah, the engineer leading research into the lost civilisation known as the Guardians, has commented on reports of interaction between Guardian and Thargoid technology:

« The fact that Guardian artefacts react to the Thargoid device certainly seems to suggest some kind of prior contact, and although we know very little about Thargoid history, interaction between the two races is entirely possible. But the negative nature of the reaction could be a sign that the relationship was not entirely peaceful. »

* Galactic News: People's Rakapila Progressive Party Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the People's Rakapila Progressive Party has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering domestic appliances, consumer technology and clothing to Stone Enterprise in Rakapila, and by eliminating agitators in the system so traders could deliver commodities in safety.

The organisation has thanked those who supported the campaign. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system.


* Galactic News: Pilots Federation Initiative Concludes
The Pilots Federation has announced that its campaign to clear the LHS 3447, Eravate and Asellus Primus systems of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of combat pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the systems.

The purpose of the initiative was to secure the systems for inexperienced pilots, many of whom start their careers there. As the campaign drew to a close, authorities in the pertinent systems reiterated their hope that the success of the initiative would allow peacekeeping forces to maintain lasting peace.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cleve Hub in the Erevate system, Beagle 2 Landing in the Asellus Primus system or Dalton Gateway in the LHS 3447 system.


* Community Goal: New Federal Outpost
The Federation has announced plans to construct a new survey outpost in the HIP 17692 system. Federal sources have confirmed that the outpost is designed to give the Federation a vantage point, close to the Pleiades, from which to monitor Thargoid activity.

A Federal spokesperson gave the following statement:

« To date, Thargoid vessels have been encountered in the Maia system and around the Pleiades Nebula, so we feel it is important to have a reconnaissance outpost as close to this region as possible. »

The Federation, in coordination with the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, has placed an open order for power generators, geological equipment and meta-alloys for use in the campaign, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system. The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering material to Blackmount Orbital can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 6th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: New Superpower Bases in the Pleiades
Last month, the Empire and the Federation launched initiatives to bolster their presences in the Pleiades star cluster. Following the successful conclusion of both campaigns, the superpowers set to work on their respective construction projects. These projects have now come to an end.

In the HR 1185 system, Imperial Senator Zemina Torval presided over the maiden voyage of the Indra, a massive Wells-class Carrier. She concluded the launch with a brief statement, saying « Space is by nature hostile. The Indra will make this particular system less so. »

Meanwhile, the Federation announced the completion of Blackmount Orbital, an asteroid base sited among the rings of HIP 17692 A4 in the HIP 17692 system. A Federal spokesperson confirmed the outpost would offer a wide range of services to independent pilots.

As the number of newly discovered Thargoid structures continues to grow, reports from the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 indicate that the Oracle, an Ocellus starport, has relocated to the system in order to study the region's Thargoid structure.

Governor Ahmed, the starport's principal administrator, released the following statement:

« The Oracle has long been a hub for scientific research, and in recent years many of our researchers have started focusing on Unknown Artefacts and Probes. The Thargoid structures are ripe for further study, and I therefore believe it is essential that we have a dedicated research centre at one of these sites. »

« We need to know more about the Thargoids \u2013 what they want, why they're here and ideally how to communicate with them. My hope is that the Oracle will help us answer some of these questions. »

The Oracle is expected to arrive in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 within the next few days.

* Community Goal: Pleiades Research Outpost
The recent revelation that the Thargoids have returned to human space has sent shockwaves through the galaxy.

Some, such as Federal President Zachary Hudson, have reacted defensively, promising to protect humanity from what they believe is an aggressive alien race. More moderate voices have underscored the need for further information, since so little is known about the Thargoids.

One such voice belongs to Abroin Universal Plc, which has announced plans to establish a research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula \u2013 one of the centres of Thargoid activity.

A spokesperson for the organisation said:

« The Thargoids are active principally in the Pleiades Nebula, so we are eager to establish a research outpost there. As Edmund Mahon said, there is potentially a great deal we could learn from them. Hopefully this new outpost will let us do just that. »

Abroin Universal Plc has placed an open order for Semiconductors, Lithium and Energy Grid Assemblies for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Campbell Horizons in the Abroin system. The organisation placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those delivering material to Campbell Horizons can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 20th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Community Goal: Harma Silver Cartel Appeal
The Harma Silver Cartel has announced that it intends to bring back a beverage that has been lost for several hundred years: rum.

Reports indicate that the organisation recently discovered a time capsule from the 24th century containing a recipe for the drink, as well as the log of one Captain Smolenski. Although the Cartel is keeping the recipe secret, it has placed an open order for a range of rare alcohols that will be used to create the new beverage.

The Cartel has promised to reward those who deliver the requested commodities to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. The organisation has also promised to bring the drink to the market under the name Harma Silver Sea Rum, assuming the campaign is successful.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:

« We will create the finest rum since the days of piracy on the seas of Earth. After all, a pirate isn't a pirate without rum! »

But the announcement has antagonised other pirate organisations in the Harma system, many of which have threatened to blockade the Cartel's base of operations and attack pilots delivering alcohols to Gabriel Enterprise.

To counter this threat, the Harma Silver Cartel has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Gabriel Enterprise.

The two-pronged initiative begins on 27th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the organisation gave a brief statement:

« We have been brought into contact with an intelligent, space-faring species. Just think of what we could learn from them! With luck, this outpost will herald a whole new era of scientific research. »

* Community Goal: Conflict in Hehe
Authorities in the Hehe system have reported that conflict has erupted between Hehe Federal Interstellar and Hehe Camorra. System security forces have confirmed that the fighting began several hours ago and has escalated rapidly since then.

The conflict is understood to be territorial in nature, with both factions eager to take control of Hehe. Both sides have issued calls for support, and have pledged to reward combat pilots who rally to their respective causes.

A representative of system security forces commented on the development:

« Inter-faction conflict of this sort tends to be quite focused, and we believe that the probability of civilian casualties is low. Nevertheless, we're advising anyone living or travelling in the system to exercise caution. »

The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 3rd of August 3303.


* Galactic News: Harma Silver Cartel Appeal Concludes
A spokesperson for the Harma Silver Cartel has announced that its appeal for rare alcohols has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering rare alcohols and eliminating agitators so traders could reach Gabriel Enterprise safely.

* Galactic News: Joint Superpower Initiative Announced
In recent weeks, a number of programmes have been launched to gather further information about the Thargoids. While the Federation has established an outpost in HIP 17692 to monitor Thargoid activity, independent organisation Abroin Universal PLC recently completed a campaign to amass material for a research centre in the Pleiades Nebula.

But not everyone believes such initiatives represent the best way to proceed, with a growing number of voices calling for an inter-superpower initiative that consolidates existing knowledge and resources.

Now these individuals are about to have their wishes granted. At a hastily convened press conference in the Sorbago system, Professor Alba Tesreau of the Achenar Research Council announced that a confederacy of scientists from the Empire, Federation and Alliance has united to establish a new organisation: Aegis. The organisation's remit will be to gather further intelligence on the Thargoids and coordinate all future research.

Professor Tesreau said:

« While I applaud recent efforts to learn more about the Thargoids, we can achieve far more by working together. It is imperative that we coordinate our efforts, and share our knowledge and expertise. That is what Aegis has been created to achieve. »

« Naturally, the cold war between the Federation and the Empire has complicated efforts to make this initiative a reality. Fortunately, while there may be antagonism between our governments, there is a strong desire for collaboration and cooperation within the scientific community. »

Having received substantial funding from all three superpowers, Aegis will soon establish its first research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula.

Authorities in the Hehe system have reported that the conflict between Hehe Federal Interstellar and Hehe Camorra has ended in a victory for Hehe Federal Interstellar .

Both factions issued calls for support, promising generous rewards to pilots who lent their aid, but ultimately it was Hehe Federal Interstellar that emerged victorious. Hehe Camorra has now withdrawn its forces from the system.

As the last Hehe Camorra ships left the field of battle, a representative of Hehe Federal Interstellar released a statement:

« The brave pilots who rallied to our cause have our everlasting gratitude. And to the people of Hehe, I say this: we're going to do everything in our power to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for our system. »


* Community Goal: Alliance Research Initiative
The Alliance has launched a new research initiative designed to enhance human understanding of the Thargoids. The primary aim of the initiative is to build a range of state-of-the-art instruments expressly designed to analyse Thargoid material.

To this end, the Alliance has placed an open order for unknown ship signatures, unknown organic circuitry and unknown technology components. The Kaushpoos Pro-Alliance Union has been authorised to oversee the campaign, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested resources to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering resources to Neville Horizons can do so safely.

In a statement, an Alliance spokesperson said:

« Although humanity has had prior contact with the Thargoids, our knowledge remains limited. It is essential that we expand our understanding. We therefore intend to build a range of specialised tools and analytic instruments with which to study Thargoid material. »

The campaign begins on the 10th of August 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Galactic News: Sirius Corporation Enters Merope
A number of media outlets have reported that the Sirius Corporation has entered the Merope system, establishing two new outposts.

Although the mega-corporation has asserted that the outposts will support mining operations in the region, commentators have speculated that Sirius is positioning itself to take control of the system's barnacles.

Daxton Sung of the Imperial Herald commented:

« Right now, the Federation controls Merope. But Sirius is playing the long game. They've positioned themselves close to the barnacles so that if the Federation pulls out of the system, they can swoop in and start hoovering up meta-alloys. »

The new outposts will no doubt be a boon to independent pilots in Merope, giving them access to a wide range of services.

* Galactic News: Alliance Defends Research Initiative
The Alliance has been criticised for its recent appeal for Thargoid data, which began only days after a joint-superpower initiative was established to study the Thargoids.

A number of independent factions, including the Federal Republican Command, have censured the Alliance for its apparently contradictory stance.

A spokesperson for the Alliance was quick to respond:

« Aegis emerged from a spirit of unity, so we can understand why an independent initiative could be seen as undermining that philosophy. The simple truth is that it takes a long time to plan a campaign of this sort, and in this case our preparations began long before Aegis was established. Cancelling the campaign would have had dire repercussions for our partners, the Kaushpoos Pro-Alliance Union, to whom we have a contractual obligation. Rest assured that the instruments we plan to develop will be made available to Aegis, to which the Alliance is fully committed. »

* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes
The Alliance has announced that its new research initiative has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Huge quantities of resources were delivered to Neville Horizons over the past week, allowing the Alliance to start constructing a range of instruments expressly designed to analyse Thargoid material. The campaign also received the support of hundreds of independent combat pilots, who took to their ships to protect the spaceways and defend the traders contributing to the initiative.

As the campaign drew to a close, an Alliance spokesperson said:

« With the aid of the galactic community, we are now in a position to embark on a detailed study of Thargoid technology and other material. I hasten to add, however, that analysis of this kind is a slow process. The public should not expect profound revelations in the immediate future! But rest assured that our scientists will be working tirelessly to deepen our understanding of the Thargoids. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.

Figures from the worlds of finance, politics and entertainment are expected to attend the event, which this year will be held in the Secoya system.

The Summit is not without its detractors, with political commentator Sal Riley recently condemning it as \a grotesquely opulent and outmoded display of self-congratulation\. Nevertheless, the number of influential figures in attendance has prompted suggestions that more policy making is concluded at the Summit than in the Senate.

As the event approaches, Secoya Emperor's Grace has placed an open order for a range of luxury commodities, promising to reward pilots who delivering master chefs, Kamitra cigars and Sanuma decorative meat to Joy Port in the Secoya system.

Reports have surfaced that Admiral Aden Tanner, Chief of Federal Security and so-called 'alien tsar', is now liaising with Aegis, the inter-superpower initiative established to investigate the Thargoids.

News of Admiral Tanner's involvement has already prompted speculation that the cold war between the Empire and the Federation could be thawing. Contrasting voices have suggested that Tanner's association could divert Aegis from its scientific agenda and set it on a more militaristic course.

In the wake of this development, Admiral Tanner made the following statement:

« It is my sincere pleasure to support Aegis in its mission and contribute to what I hope will be a new era of collaboration. I know there are those who have questioned my involvement with Aegis, but I can assure you that after forty years in the military, I am ready for some peace. »

« Our current priorities are determining the scale of the Thargoids' presence in human space and confirming their intentions regarding humanity. We have no concrete information to share with the galactic community at this time, however. »

* Galactic News: Order Restored in Kaal
The Kuk Silver Fortune Company has announced that its campaign to clear the Kaal system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Authorities in the Kaal system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vercors Station in the Kaal system.


* Galactic News: Imperial Appeal Concludes
Secoya Emperor's Grace has announced that its appeal for luxury goods has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal by delivering commodities to Joy Port for this year's Sigma Summit, a conference attended by some of the Empire's most powerful individuals.

Censure of the event failed to deter traders or intimidate this year's guest of honour, Imperial Senator Zemina Torval, who responded to criticism by saying simply « The Summit is an institution. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Joy Port in the Secoya system.


* Community Goal: The Path to Colonia
The Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition has announced plans to establish a series of starports between the core systems and Colonia to make the daunting voyage a little easier. A total of three starports have been planned, which the Chapterhouse hopes will expedite the creation of a freight and passenger service known as the Blue Star Line.

The Chapterhouse has placed an open order for gold, robotics and auto-fabricators for the first of these starports, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system. System authorities have also pledged to issue generous rewards for Chapterhouse-issued bounties, to ensure safe delivery of goods to the starport.

Announcing the campaign, Governor Shelby Ortega said:

« The growth of Colonia has been astounding, but its continued success depends on developing more substantive infrastructure. Having received the blessing of the Colonia Council, the Chapterhouse of Inquisition intends to realise a vision of trans-galactic commerce that will benefit all of humanity. »

The first phase of the campaign begins on the 24th of August 3303. The second phase begins on the 31st of August, and the final phase begins on the 7th of September. All three phases will run for one week unless targets are met earlier than planned.


* Galactic News: Kpelidoog Empire Assembly Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Kpelidoog Empire Assembly has announced that its plan to build a new Wells-class Carrier has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Kpelidoog Empire Assembly released a statement:

« We are immeasurably grateful to all those who supported this initiative. Having met our targets, we hope to start work on the new ship soon. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Hipparchus Terminal in the Kpelidoog system.

* Galactic News: The Thargoid Situation
Although the first hints of the Thargoid presence began with the discovery of Unknown Artefacts in 3301, the current chapter in the Thargoid story started last year with the discovery of alien shipwrecks in the Pleiades Nebula. A few months later, in January 3303, the first interdiction from a Thargoid ship was reported.

In May, accounts surfaced of attacks in the Maia system against Federal vessels. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen Thargoid ships at the sites, but the Federation refused to comment on the possibility of Thargoid involvement.

A key discovery was made a few weeks later, when massive Thargoid structures were found in a number of systems. Several of these structures were discovered to contain functional Thargoid technology.

With events unfolding at such a rapid pace, the superpowers have struggled to formulate appropriate responses. But the creation of Aegis, a joint-superpower initiative designed to coordinate research into the Thargoids, suggests that the galaxy's leaders are now taking steps to address the situation.

Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, offered the following assessment:

« We are faced with a number of pressing questions. Why have the Thargoids entered human space? Can we communicate with them? Are they hostile? Hopefully Aegis can provide us with some answers. »

Meanwhile, in an article for the Imperial Herald, journalist Kelvin Masters gave a more frank analysis:

« The barnacles seem to indicate that the Thargoids were in Maia and Merope long before we were. For all we know, humanity has expanded into what the Thargoids see as their territory. I have no interest in scaremongering, but my belief is that a Thargoid attack could be imminent \u2013 their behaviour certainly seems to suggest they are probing us for weaknesses. »

* Galactic News: Cold War Thawing?
Following news that scientists from the Alliance, Empire and Federation have united to form a new research initiative, speculation is mounting that the cold war between the Empire and the Federation could be nearing an end.

As the conflict enters its second year, a number of commentators have expressed hope that peace might be in sight. The Imperial Herald's political correspondent, Daxton Sung, offered the following analysis:

« It's inevitable that the formation of Aegis would lead to assumptions that the cold war is ending, but unfortunately there's little evidence to that effect. These are the galaxy's largest superpowers we're talking about. The fact that there's accord among certain sectors doesn't mean there's harmony at every level. »

« But what does either side have to gain from maintaining its position? Neither the Empire nor the Federation has demonstrated it can prevent the other from extracting meta-alloys, which is supposedly what this conflict is all about. The only person to have been significantly affected by all this is poor old Professor Palin, who's still languishing behind a Federal blockade. »

« Frankly, the situation is farcical. I suspect both Arissa Lavigny-Duval and Zachary Hudson know they're better off calling time on the whole thing, but neither side wants to be seen as ceding to the other. It's about pride, essentially. Shouldn't our leaders be above such things? »

Neither Federal nor Imperial sources elected to comment.

Reports that the Federal\u2013Imperial cold war could soon end have resulted in jubilation in many parts of the galaxy.

While the impact of the conflict has been relatively modest, many thousands of galactic citizens have nevertheless been disrupted. But as talk of a truce gains ground, anonymous sources have reported that influential Imperials have questioned the wisdom of withdrawing from the Pleiades.

Daxton Sung of the Imperial Herald said:

« Can the Federation be trusted? That's the question the Empire is asking. Assuming both sides agree to withdraw, the Empire is worried that the Federation will renege on the deal. But such heel-dragging is to be expected. The fact is that there's a real desire, on both sides of the fence, to end this ridiculous conflict. »

* Galactic News: Federal Blockade Ends
In October last year, the Federation was criticised for positioning a Farragut-class Battlecruiser above Maia A 3 a, not far from the personal research base of Professor Ishmael Palin.

The deployment, which came only days after Professor Palin announced a breakthrough in his research into meta-alloys, was widely interpreted as an attempt to restrict Palin's movement and curtail his research.

The condemnation of rival political powers and the efforts of a number of political campaigners did little to affect the blockade. But recent reports from Maia indicate that the Federal ships have now withdrawn, effectively ending the cordon of Maia A 3 a.

Rici Stewart, writing for The Imperial Herald, offering the following evaluation:

« The Federation knows that blockading Professor Palin was \u2013 at best \u2013 unethical, so I'm not surprised they chose not to comment on their withdrawal. They just slipped away in the night. »

« As with their efforts to control meta-alloys, the Federation's attempts to restrict access to Palin's base were far from successful. I guess the Federation has realised it can't control the galaxy. If you ask me, this is another sign that the Federal-Imperial cold war could be coming to an end. »

Naturally, Professor Palin was pleased with the development:

« We may never know exactly why the Federation blockaded Maia A 3 a. Frankly, the galaxy's superpowers have always been rather incomprehensible to me. All I can say is: I'm glad they're gone. »

But fresh reports indicate that another attack, resulting in the loss of a Farragut-class Battlecruiser and a number of other vessels, has recently taken place. In a galaxy-wide announcement, the Federation confirmed that the attack was perpetrated by Thargoid Interceptor-class vessels, as corroborated by those who survived the assault.

Chief of Federal Security Admiral Aden Tanner issued the following statement:

« Since we cannot communicate with the Thargoids, and cannot therefore determine the motive for this attack, it cannot be considered an act of war in the conventional sense. Nevertheless, I can confirm that the Thargoids are now considered an enemy of the Federation. »

Admiral Tanner's statement was swiftly followed by a public address from Federal President Zachary Hudson, speaking from the White House on Mars.

« Like many others, I hoped that the Thargoids would prove to be peaceful. Today I am forced to concede that my optimism was misplaced. What I say now, I say to every citizen of the Federation: Action will be taken. »

« I have given Admiral Tanner total authority over this matter, and extended to him the full resources of the Federal Navy. I have every confidence that he will address this threat to the Federation. »


* Galactic News: Peace Declared in Ho Hsi
Authorities in the Ho Hsi system have confirmed that the conflict between Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited and the Freedom Party of Ho Hsi has come to an end.

Ho Hsi media outlets have reported that the battle was won by Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited. The Freedom Party of Ho Hsi is understood to have withdrawn its forces.

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately it was Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited that emerged victorious.

A spokesperson for Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited issued a statement to those who rallied to their cause:

« Without your help, the Freedom Party of Ho Hsi might have got the better of us. We'll never forget it. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Hand Ring in the Ho Hsi system.


* Community Goal: Engineers Appeal for Thargoid Material
Following news that the Thargoids have attacked a Federal convoy in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system, Aegis has recruited two of the galaxy's foremost independent engineers to immediately begin developing new defensive and offensive technologies.

One of these engineers is Liz Ryder, a specialist in explosive weaponry, who spoke to The Federal Times about her involvement:

« It's not about penetrating the Thargoids' shields \u2013 we've been blowing each other up for centuries so we've gotten pretty good at dealing punishment \u2013 it's about creating weapons that are specifically calibrated to damage Thargoid hardware. »

Ryder was asked if she thought it was too late to avert all-out conflict with the Thargoids:

« That's a question for the politicians. My job is to design weapons. And if someone \u2013 or something \u2013 shoots at you, you've got two choices: run away or shoot back. At the moment, the first of those is our only option. It would be nice to have a second. »

Professor Ishmael Palin, a leading authority on xenobiology, has also been recruited to the programme. He said:

« My first task will be developing a scanner that can provide us with meaningful data on the Thargoids' ships. Of course, to properly calibrate these new technologies we will need large quantities of Thargoid material. »

Aegis has placed an open order for a range of Thargoid materials for use in the programme. Aegis Core has pledged to reward pilots who deliver unknown technology samples, unknown biological matter, ancient relics and explosives to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system for Liz Ryder. Aegis Research has promised to reimburse Commanders who deliver unknown technology samples, unknown resin, computer components and resonating separators to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system for Ishmael Palin.

The campaign begins on the 21st of September and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Aegis to Widen Remit
A spokesperson for Aegis, the joint-superpower initiative established to coordinate research into the Thargoids, has confirmed that the organisation is to widen its remit.

The development is understood to be a response to the recent Thargoid attack against Federal ships in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 system.

In a statement, the spokesperson said:

« Aegis has received sanctions from the leaders of all three superpowers to focus not only on research, but also on defence. This reflects a belief that Aegis, which includes some of the galaxy's foremost experts on non-human life, is best positioned to coordinate such efforts. »

« We understand that some will lament this development, but the decision was arrived at only after careful consideration, and all parties have agreed on its necessity. Rest assured that our research initiatives will continue. »

It is understood that the organisation's budget has been dramatically increased.


* Galactic News: Federation Addresses Rumours
Following news that a Federal convoy was destroyed by Thargoid vessels in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 system, Lieutenant Jarah Kael of the Federal Navy has addressed rumours that the Thargoids may have attacked in self-defence.

« There has been speculation that the Thargoid attack was an act of self-preservation. Nothing could be further from the truth. »

« It is true that Thargoid vessels typically scan human craft rather than attack, so I can understand how this misconception has taken root, but I assure you it is baseless. Data recovered from IR-W D1-55, including the black box from the Farragut-class Battlecruiser, proves beyond a doubt that the attack was initiated by the Thargoids. To suggest otherwise dishonours the memory of those who lost their lives in this tragedy. »

A spokesperson for Aegis, which is coordinating research into the Thargoids, confirmed the veracity of Lieutenant Kael's statement:

« We have been analysing the data from the attack site in an effort to understand the Thargoids' motives and military capabilities. While I cannot yet reveal the results of that analysis, I can confirm that the convoy was attacked without provocation by multiple Thargoid vessels. »

* Community Goal: Second Aegis Initiative
Last week, Aegis started developing weapons and technologies to address the rising Thargoid threat. While some were dismayed to see Aegis shift to a military focus, the general consensus was that the move was necessary.

Following news that Aegis is to embark on a second development initiative, Aegis' military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner released the following statement:

\The Thargoids represent a very real threat, and their hostility demands that we take appropriate action. As with our previous initiative, our intention is to collaborate with some of the galaxy's foremost engineers to develop efficient anti-Thargoid technologies.\

In support of this aim, Aegis's corporate partners Wolf 397 Independents have pledged to reward pilots who deliver tantalum, Thargoid Cyclops tissue samples and CMM Composites to Chelbin Service Station in the Wolf 397 system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of September and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Winged Hussars Appeal
The Winged Hussars have announced plans to establish a recreational installation and a tourist beacon in the HIP 110028 system, next to a little-visited Earth-like world.

The organisation has said it hopes to attract wealthy tourists from core systems such as Sol and Achenar \u2013 people who want to relax, but who also want to experience some adventure.

The Winged Hussars are providing the materials for the new installation, but to cater to the tastes of their future clients they have asked for quantities of Lavian Brandy, Eranin Pearl Whisky, Kongga Ale, Leestian Evil Juice, Indi Bourbon and Bast Snake Gin. Pilots who deliver these intoxicants to Zander Dock in HIP 110028 system will be handsomely rewarded.

A spokesperson for the group said:

\This is a great opportunity to bring new business to one of the galaxy's border colonies. We are asking independent pilots for help, and we are prepared to offer very competitive prices for the liquors we have requested.\

The campaign begins on the 28th of September 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal:  Setting up the Candy Shop
The Candy Crew Guild, an independent corporate organisation based in the Irusan system, has announced plans to establish a capital shipyard and a scientific research vessel in its home system. It has placed an open order for various commodities for use in the construction.

Commander Raijiin, head of the organisation, elaborated on the nature of the campaign.

« We need quantities of palladium, titanium and robotics, and we encourage all able and willing pilots to assist us. »

« We are expecting the initiative to attract agitators, but security in the system has been increased and many of our own wings are patrolling the trade lanes, to ensure no crime goes unpunished. »

The Candy Crew Guild has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested commodities to Bella Port in the Irusan system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of September 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Engineers' Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for Aegis has announced that its appeal for Thargoid-related materials has reached a successful conclusion. Huge quantities of material were delivered to Awyra Flirble and Obsidian Orbital over the past week, following an enthusiastic response from the galactic community. They will now be delivered to the engineers Liz Ryder and Ishmael Palin so they can start work on new technologies to address the mounting Thargoid threat.

As the campaign drew to a close, the spokesperson issued a brief statement:

« Initiatives of this kind are a mainstay of the galactic economy, but this campaign is of singular importance. Humanity is faced with a clear threat to its safety, and we must do everything we can to oppose it. »

« Furthermore, if we are to successfully resist the Thargoids, we will need to develop more advanced technologies. This will not be the last campaign of this kind. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system and Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.


* Galactic News: Report from the Front Lines
Many independent pilots have already taken to their ships to test the anti-Thargoid weaponry recently developed by Aegis. Meanwhile, Aegis has assembled a team of specialists to analyse the results of these encounters and determine the new weapons' efficacy.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's military liaison, said:

« The weapons are working as intended, but the Thargoid vessels are highly resilient. Even with specialised weaponry, it appears their ships can be destroyed only through collective efforts. »

« We have received reports of lone pilots, and even small groups, being utterly annihilated by the Thargoids. This tragic news illustrates that although the new weapons are effective, more work must be done if we are to achieve military parity. »


* Galactic News: Further Thargoid Attacks
As Aegis's first campaign to address the Thargoid threat concludes, reports have reached the core systems of further Thargoid attacks in the Pleiades.

On this occasion, a number of Imperial and civilian ships were targeted, with the strikes taking place in HIP 17225, HR 1185, IH-V C2-5 and the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55. The violence is believed to have resulted in a number of human fatalities.

As with the recent attack in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 system, data recovered from the sites indicates that the Thargoids attacked without provocation. Although some of the ships returned fire, none succeeded in destroying or damaging the Thargoid vessels.

Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute and an authority on xenobiology, commented on the news:

« If the Thargoids believe they have some claim to the Pleiades, then what we're seeing could be territorialism. But it's equally possible that they see humanity as an enemy, irrespective of where they encounter us. At this stage it's hard to draw any definite conclusions. »


* Galactic News: Thargoids Adapting Rapidly
Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis' chief military liaison, has released a statement confirming that the Thargoids have begun adapting to the weapons and tactics developed to combat them.

Admiral Tanner's statement is reprinted in full below.

« Preliminary reports indicate that although the AX missiles were inflicting significant damage on the Thargoid ships' 'heart' modules, they are now proving less effective. We believe this is due to the Thargoids developing a resistance to the compound carried by the missiles. I am optimistic, however, that the current Aegis initiative will produce weapons capable of overcoming this resistance. »

« Second, we have been informed that the Thargoids are now able to lock onto ships that have deployed countermeasures, although exactly how they are doing this is not yet understood. »

« Previously, Thargoid ships responded to strategic withdrawal by advancing towards the target, even when attacked with missiles. But recent reports indicate that they have started dodging such attacks, particularly when engaged at long range. Finally, the drones deployed by the Thargoid ships have become more accurate, which substantially increases the risk they present to smaller craft. »

« These developments illustrate that we are dealing with a highly intelligent enemy capable of rapidly adapting to our weapons and tactics, and underscore the importance of Aegis' ongoing anti-Thargoid initiative. »

* Galactic News: Candy Crew Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Candy Crew Guild has announced that its appeal for palladium, titanium and robotics was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Bella Port, the organisation's base of operations.

The Candy Crew Guild has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

« We are extremely happy to announce that our plans have succeeded. Work on the Dan Gurney Drive Yards and the Cave Johnson Memorial Science Lab has begun, and these facilities will soon be fully operational. Thank you to all those who supported this initiative. »

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Bella Port in the Irusan system.


* Community Goal: Secret Billionaires' Campaign
The Secret Billionaires, an organisation based in I Carinae, have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in their system. The organisation has responded with a system-wide operation designed to remove the agitators and restore order. They have placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list, and have promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Somerset Station.

Secret Billionaires spokesperson Commander Afterglow said:

\After one of our CFOs was pirated, the board decided that a cleanup was long overdue, and they immediately provided credit for an anti-piracy operation.\

\We're therefore in a position to offer generous rewards to pilots who help us clean up the system. With the support of the galactic community, we should be able to guarantee the safety of our fellow miners and traders.\

The campaign begins on the 5th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Winged Hussars Appeal Comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Winged Hussars has announced that its appeal for rare liquors was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Zander Dock, the organisation's base of operations.

A spokesperson for the Winged Hussars has issued the following statement:

« I would like to thank the galactic community for its help, and assure them that their work will bring new business opportunities to this remote region of space. The border colonies are grateful for your efforts, Commanders! »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Zander Dock in the HIP 110028 system.


* Community Goal: Growing Independence
When the S'jett family was driven out of its home system by Federal-Imperial conflict, it established a new an independent faction in HIP 104292 \u2013 the Kuun-Lan.

Since then, the Kuun-Lan has gone from strength to strength. But while its new home has become a haven for miners and traders, one thing is missing: a reliable source of food. The Kuun-Lan has therefore announced plans to establish an agricultural network in HIP 104292, and is calling on the galactic community for support.

The organisation has reserved generous reimbursements for pilots who contribute atmospheric processors, crop harvesters, land enrichment systems, building fabricators, animal monitors and aquaponic systems to the initiative.

A spokesperson for the group released the following statement:

\We hope the galactic community will heed our call and help us secure our independence. If we can successfully complete this campaign, we can improve living standards for millions of people.\

The campaign begins on the 5th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Second Aegis Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for Aegis has announced that its appeal for Thargoid-related materials has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver material to Chelbin Service Station, which will be used to develop new anti-Thargoid technologies.

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Aden Tanner released the following statement:

« Those who supported this initiative have my gratitude. With each new discovery, humanity becomes stronger. But we still have a long way to go. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Chelbin Service Station in the Wolf 397 system.


* Community Goal: Third Aegis Initiative
Aegis has announced the third phase of its programme to counter the Thargoid threat, and is once again turning to the galactic community for the necessary Thargoid-related materials.

As the campaign began, Aegis' Head of Research, Professor Alba Tesreau, released the following statement:

\We are facing a technologically superior enemy, and it is essential that we redress the balance. But for each new device we develop, we need huge quantities of Thargoid material so we can calibrate the technology and ensure its efficacy.\

The initiative has received financial support from the Wyrd Jet Power Industries, which has pledged to reimburse pilots who deliver Thargoid Cyclops tissue samples, micro controllers and explosives to Vonarburg Co-operative in the Wyrd system.

The campaign begins on the 5th of October and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Federation Withdraws from Pleiades
Authorities in systems throughout the Pleiades Nebula have reported that the Federation has withdrawn its ships from the region. The development follows ongoing speculation regarding the Federal-Imperial cold war.

The Federation first deployed ships to the Pleiades over two years ago, in a move that was widely interpreted as an attempt to control the region's meta-alloys. The Empire responded by positioning several Majestic-class Interdictors in the Pleiades. A period of hostility ensued, with both superpowers engaging in a number of proxy conflicts.

The Imperial Herald's political correspondent, Daxton Sung, who has repeatedly written about the conflict, said:

« There's little doubt in my mind that the formation of Aegis served as a catalyst for this development, but the current wave of Thargoid hostility was probably the main cause. President Hudson is keenly aware that to continue to oppose the Empire, when humanity is faced with an alien threat, would do him no favours politically. So I'm not surprised by this development, although I will admit that I didn't expect the Federation to make the first move. »

Neither the Federation nor the Empire has commented on the issue, but it is expected that the Empire will also withdraw its ships from the Pleiades soon.

Daxton Sung commented:

« I don't care how cynical Hudson's motives are \u2013 this is good news. And we could certainly use some right about now. »


* Galactic News: Thargoid Threat Continues to Escalate
Numerous sources have reported that Thargoid activity has escalated dramatically in recent days, with attacks from Thargoid Interceptor-class ships becoming increasingly common in the Pleiades Nebula. Reports confirm that Imperial, Federal and civilian ships have all been targeted. Images captured by survivors of these attacks show Thargoid ships scanning wreckage and gathering debris, including occupied escape pods.

As Aegis continues to analyse the results of these encounters, the organisation's military liaison, Aden Tanner, released the following statement:

« We are aware that the Interceptors have started capturing escape pods, although we currently have no way of knowing if this is a deliberate strategy or simply a symptom of curiosity. That is not to suggest, of course, that the Thargoids' motives are benign, as it is clear they are not. »

« Furthermore, the ships we have designated 'Interceptors' have started deploying clusters of attack drones, which swarm enemy ships while the Interceptor attacks from range. This significantly enhances the risk presented by the Thargoids, and I urge all pilots operating in the Pleiades to exercise caution. »

« The question is: What is the Thargoids' objective? All available resources will be directed to answering this question. »

* Galactic News: Empire Pulls Out of Pleiades
In the wake of reports that the Federation has withdrawn from the Pleiades Nebula, authorities in the region have confirmed that the Empire has followed suit. The development, predicted by many, appears to signal the end of the Federal-Imperial cold war.

The inter-superpower conflict began with the deployment of a Federal fleet to the Merope system, shortly followed by the positioning of several Majestic-class Interdictors. It was evident to observers that these manoeuvres were intended to control the region's meta-alloys.

A number of proxy conflicts took place over the following months, but it quickly became clear that the superpowers were locked in a stalemate, with neither side willing to either up the ante or withdraw.

As the conflict wore on, public opinion was perhaps best expressed by The Imperial Herald's political correspondent Daxton Sung, who noted that:

« Neither the Empire nor the Federation has demonstrated it can prevent the other from extracting meta-alloys, which is supposedly what this conflict is all about. Frankly, the situation is farcical. »

The catalyst for the Federal withdrawal appears to have been the rising Thargoid threat, coupled with creation of the tri-superpower organisation Aegis.

Neither the Empire nor the Federation has commented on the withdrawal of its fleets.


* Galactic News: Abandoned INRA Outpost Discovered
A number of media feeds in the core systems have reported the discovery of an abandoned planetary outpost in the Hermitage system.

The reports, together with images captured by independent pilots, indicate that the outpost was controlled by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a joint Federal-Imperial initiative established in the 3100s.

Very little is known about the INRA, but reports from the time assert that it was established to address Thargoid incursions into human space, and that it developed a chemical weapon designed to target Thargoid technology.

Reports that the site contains logs describing INRA research are currently being corroborated.


* Galactic News: Thargoids Continuing to Adapt
Fresh reports from the Pleiades have yielded further insights into the Thargoids' tactics.

An Aegis spokesperson summarised the latest intelligence:

« Our initial encounters with the Thargoids indicated a certain lack of strategic awareness on their part, but they have clearly been watching, and learning. The latest reports indicate that they're already operating more tactically, suggesting that their earlier lack of insight was due to unfamiliarity with our ships and weapons. »

« As noted before, we are clearly dealing with a highly responsive enemy, and we underestimate them at our peril. »


* Community Goal: Remembrance Week
Last year, a commemorative event was held for the late entrepreneur Walter Waldo in the Gyvatices system. Not only was the memorial a success, it became an event of collective remembrance, as pilots from across the galaxy convened to honour people and events of personal significance.

Following the event's popularity, the Labour Union of Kauruk has announced the first annual Remembrance Week. The event will give the public an opportunity to remember absent friends and departed loved ones.

As preparations begin, the organisation has placed an open order for a range of commodities and materials, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Moore Terminal in the Kauruk system.

A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement:

\Most of us have something we want to honour, celebrate, or remember. This event will give the galactic community a chance to do just that, in an atmosphere of mutual support.\

\I believe this is something the galaxy needs \u2013 now more than ever.\

The campaign begins on 12th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Kuun-Lan Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Kuun-Lan has announced that its appeal for commodities was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Lomonosov City, the organisation's base of operations.

A spokesperson for the group released the following statement:

« We are overjoyed that the galactic community has rallied to our cause, and we are immensely grateful to all those who participated. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lomonosov City in the HIP 104292 system.


* Galactic News: Third Aegis Campaign Concludes
Aegis has announced that the third phase of its campaign has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Huge quantities of material were delivered to Vonarburg Co-operative over the past week, which will be used to develop new anti-Thargoid technologies.

As the campaign drew to a close, Aegis's Head of Research, Professor Alba Tesreau, released the following statement:

« I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who supported this initiative. The materials you delivered are already on their way to our engineering contractor, and the resultant device should be available soon. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vonarburg Co-operative in the Wyrd system.


* Galactic News: Secret Billionaires' Campaign Concludes
The Secret Billionaires have announced that their campaign to clear the I Carinae system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Commander Ranger-One, a member of the Secret Billionaires, issued the following statement:

« We would like to thank the galactic community for cleaning up our system. The people of I Carinae can now look forward to a period of peace and stability. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Somerset Station in the I Carinae system.


* Community Goal: Fourth Aegis Initiative
Aegis's campaign to counter the rising Thargoid threat has entered its fourth phase. Once again, the tri-superpower organisation has secured financial support from a corporate partner, which has placed an open order for various commodities.

As the campaign began, The Federal Times spoke to Elvira Martuuk, one of many independent engineers contracted by Aegis, who is overseeing this stage of the campaign. Martuuk said:

\The Thargoids' ability to disable our ships is one of their most formidable weapons. For the past few weeks I've been working on a device that I hope will protect human vessels from the Thargoids' immobilising field.\

The Khun Independent Governance has promised to reward pilots who deliver Thargoid Cyclops Tissue Samples, Coltan and Beryllium to Cremona Prospect in the Khun system.

The campaign begins on the 12th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Speculation over Thargoid Ship
Some of the galaxy's leading Thargoid experts have been discussing the discovery of a new alien ship in the HIP 17125 system.

Images of the crashed vessel reveal that it is structurally distinct from the Thargoid Interceptor, while sharing many superficial similarities. The ship has been classified as a 'Thargoid Scout' by the Pilots Federation for the purposes of identification and differentiation.

Discussing the discovery on the 'Galaxy Now' programme, Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, said:

« There are clear similarities between this ship and the Interceptor, both of which appear to be made from a quasi-organic material. It would be logical to extrapolate from the ship's profile that it would be faster and perhaps more manoeuvrable than the Interceptor, but I'd be reluctant to speculate further. »

Speaking on the same programme, Professor Alba Tesreau, also of Aegis, commented:

« Recent analysis of the Thargoid shipwreck in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system indicates that it is a little over 100 years old, despite being extremely similar, if not identical, to the currently active Thargoid Interceptor. This suggests that Thargoid ship design does not change particularly rapidly, and also that the shipwreck in HIP 17125 could be equally old. »

* Galactic News: Further INRA Bases Discovered
Further abandoned Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm outposts have been discovered in systems throughout the core.

Records from the sites have shed additional light on the INRA's activities, and indicate that the mycoid fungus, which was instrumental in countering the Thargoid incursions of the 3100s, was an unplanned by-product of the organisation's research.

The records also indicate that the INRA tested the mycoid on living Thargoid specimens \u2013 a revelation that has already prompted censure from ethical groups.

The following text is taken directly from one of the INRA logs:

« I know there are some who will condemn me for my part in this project. Let them. I harbour no remorse. The Thargoids understand only one thing: destruction. They will not stop until every last one of us has been reduced to dust. We have created a weapon that can prevent such a catastrophe. We have a moral obligation to use it. »

Others employed by the organisation, including the researcher whose work led to the development of the mycoid, took a different view:

« To the public, the INRA is a symbol of all that is possible when superpowers set aside their differences and work together. Well, it might have started off like that, but it's something very different now. Progress at any cost, might makes right \u2013 all our worst impulses channelled into an unaccountable organisation focused solely on making bigger and more powerful weapons. »

Response to the accounts has been mixed. Some commentators have suggested that the INRA's actions were unethical, while others have opined that it took appropriate measures to defend humanity.

Nestor Cartesius, an Imperial Senator, said:

« It is true that the INRA operated covertly, but there is nothing in the organisation's past of which we need feel ashamed, and I see no reason for its work to remain secret. The INRA achieved the objectives it was created to fulfil \u2013 very successfully, I might add. The pertinent question is if its work can be of value to us now, in the wake of the Thargoids' return. »


* Galactic News: Remembrance Campaign Comes to an End
A spokesperson for the Labour Union of Kauruk has announced that the organisation's Remembrance Week has been resoundingly endorsed by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots flocked to Moore Terminal over the past week, taking the opportunity to pay their respects to departed friends and loved ones.

As the campaign drew to a close, the spokesperson released a brief statement:

« We would like to thank all those who supported this initiative. We hope it gave you an opportunity not only to celebrate absent friends and family, but also to form new bonds with other members of the galactic community. »

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Moore Terminal in the Kauruk system.


* Galactic News: Fourth Aegis Campaign Concludes
The fourth phase of Aegis' campaign to counter the Thargoid threat has come to an end. Hundreds of independent pilots supported the initiative by taking to their ships to deliver commodities to Cremona Prospect. The materials will be used to test and mass-produce a shutdown-field neutraliser, developed by engineer Elvira Martuuk, which will counter the Thargoids' ability to disable human spacecraft.

Martuuk released a brief statement to the media:

« I want to thank those who hauled stuff out to Cremona Prospect. I just hope the tech I've developed will make a difference to the Commanders on the front lines. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cremona Prospect in the Khun system.


* Community Goal: Conflict in Colonia
Since it was founded in July 3302, the Colonia community has become a bastion of peace, seen by many as an island of calm in a sea of conflict.

But the region is not impervious to occasional outbreaks of violence, and as Colonia's population grows, such outbreaks look likely to become more frequent.

The latest such incident involves The Nameless, a criminal faction based in the Carcosa system, which has started attacking ships in Colonia. In an effort to restore order, the Colonia Council has issued a call to aid, pledging to reward pilots who help reduce the criminals' numbers. The Nameless has responded in kind, promising generous incentives to those who help fight the Colonia Council's peacekeepers.

Both factions have set out week-long operations to achieve their aims, which will begin on the 19th of October 3303.


* Galactic News: Aegis Expanding
Following news that the Empire and Federation have withdrawn from the Pleiades Nebula, contractors in the core systems have reported that Aegis is poised to establish a number of outposts in the region.

The reports indicate that Aegis intends to establish more than twenty orbital outposts in the coming months, to support its ongoing research and defence initiative. Two of these outposts have already been built, and construction of a third is expected to begin soon.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, commented briefly on the news:

« In my view it is imperative that Aegis has a consolidated presence in the Pleiades, close to the centre of Thargoid activity. Fortunately our backers in the Alliance, Empire and Federation agree with me. »


* Community Goal: The Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094's Apple-Bobbing Blowout
While Halloween is widely thought to have its roots in harvest festivals from Earth's ancient past, in the modern era it is largely seen as an opportunity to unwind and share a drink with friends.

This year, the galaxy's biggest Halloween party is taking place in the LHS 2094 system under the auspices of the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094. A range of traditional activities has been planned, including a game known as apple bobbing, although purists have been quick to point out that, \suspending oneself upside down in a vat of Leestian Evil Juice is most definitely not apple bobbing\.

To ensure the event is a success, the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 has placed an open order for a range of commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094 system.

A spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 elaborated on the nature of the event:

\There's a risk the festivities could be overshadowed by this whole Thargoid thing, but just because there are hostile aliens in Maia doesn't mean we can't have fun. I mean, the Thargoids are all the way out there...and the party is happening right here!\

The campaign begins on the 26th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Conflict in Colonia Ends
Authorities in the Colonia system have confirmed that the conflict between The Nameless and the peacekeepers of the Colonia Council has come to an end.

Both factions received support from the galactic community, but ultimately there could only be one victor \u2013 the Colonia Council.

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Jaques Station in the Colonia system.


* Galactic News: Capital Ships Vulnerable to Thargoid Attack
Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, has addressed reports of capital ships being destroyed by the Thargoids.

« Although the shutdown field neutraliser developed by Aegis is capable of protecting small ships, we have encountered difficulties adapting the technology to larger spacecraft. Furthermore, the fact that Thargoids tend to target larger vessels with multiple shutdown beams simultaneously makes the task of protecting them more difficult. »

« The fact that capital-class ships are more vulnerable to Thargoid attack means they are an ineffective way of protecting outposts, planets and shipping lanes. Consequently, for the present, the deployment of capital ships is not considered an effective defence strategy. »


* Galactic News: Analysis from the Galaxy's Most Powerful
A number of the galaxy's most powerful figures have commented on the current galactic landscape, addressing issues such as the return of Thargoids and the recent discovery of outposts formerly occupied by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm.

At a society event in the Cubeo system, Princess Aisling Duval said:

« I read the INRA records, and frankly I was sickened. How could they treat living creatures that way? I've heard of governments inventing threats to support their military programmes. Maybe that's what the INRA was. A smokescreen. »

Duval was ushered away from reporters by her publicist before she could say any more.

Senator Denton Patreus, who has spent little time in the public eye since his defeat of the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn, made the following statement on the 'Galaxy Now' programme:

« I have reviewed much of the available intelligence on the Thargoids, and it is clear that we are facing a formidable threat. Granted, we do not know the reasons for their hostility, but in my experience such details are rarely important \u2013 what's important is knowing where and when to strike. »

« The formation of Aegis is in my view a sound strategy, and represents a sensible response to this threat. Furthermore, I know Aden Tanner well, and I wholeheartedly believe he is the right man to be guiding Aegis's military strategy. »

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of the Sirius Corporation, also offered an appraisal of the situation:

« If there's one thing these INRA logs make plain, it's that humanity is capable of defeating the Thargoids, especially when we work together. And remember, most of the galaxy is functioning exactly as it always has, despite the presence of these alien aggressors. So let's maintain some perspective, shall we? »


* Galactic News: Halsey Comments on End of Cold War
With the news that the Empire has withdrawn its fleets from the Pleiades Nebula, apparently signalling the end of the Federal-Imperial cold war, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has commented on the cessation of hostilities.

Addressing a large crowd in Nerah City on Argent's Claim, Halsey said:

« Like many of you, I rejoiced when I heard the Federation had recalled its ships. But my jubilation was undercut by the knowledge that our protests and entreaties had failed to move a single Federal or Imperial vessel. Were it not for the emergence of a greater potential threat, the Empire and Federation might still be installed in the Pleiades, squabbling over barnacles. And while the impact of the conflict could have been far greater, it was still far from a bloodless war. »

« I would like to believe that the Federation and Empire have learned from this experience, but I suspect they have not. But I promise you that I will continue to help those affected by such conflicts, for as long as I am able. »


* Community Goal: Operation Andronicus
With Thargoid attacks becoming a regular occurrence in the Pleiades Nebula, Aegis has leveraged its considerable reserves to fund a military operation in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The initiative, dubbed 'Operation Andronicus', has been expressly conceived to counter Thargoid aggression in the region.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, elaborated on the nature of the initiative:

« Personal-scale craft are particularly effective against Thargoid vessels, not least because of the comparative vulnerability of capital-class ships. I therefore believe the most effective way to address the Thargoid threat \u2013 in the short term at least \u2013 is a militia of seasoned combat pilots. Aegis has agreed to finance this initiative, which will aim to deliver a strategic blow to the Thargoids in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. »

Aegis Research has confirmed that it will reward pilots who hand in Pilots Federation Combat Bonds at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.

The operation begins on the 2nd of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Halloween Appeal Concludes
A spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver goods to the LHS 2094 system for an opulent Halloween party, and to protect those ferrying commodities to Patterson Vision.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 released the following statement:

« This is going to be one of the greatest Halloween parties of all time! Who cares if the Thargoids kill us all \u2013 at least we'll go out with a bang. And we won't have to live with the hangover! »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094 system.


* Community Goal: Rescue Operation in the Pleiades
Cooper Research Associates have launched a rescue operation to recover personal effects, data and people from Thargoid attack sites in the Pleiades Nebula.

The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver occupied escape pods, damaged escape pods, black boxes and personal effects to the search-and-rescue contact at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.

A spokesperson for Cooper Research Associates released a brief statement:

« Eyewitnesses have reported that Thargoid vessels are taking occupied escape pods from ships they have attacked. It is therefore essential that we recover any and all individuals from these attack sites before they can be similarly abducted. »

The operation begins on the 2nd of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Pleiades Rescue Operation Concludes
Cooper Research Associates have announced that their rescue operation has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of independent pilots supported the campaign, taking to their ships to recover people and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites. Many of those rescued are now recovering at The Oracle.

Cooper Research Associates have extended their gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the operation can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.


* Community Goal: Wolves of Jonai Appeal
The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced plans to expand its presence in HR 7047 by constructing a new asteroid base among the rings of HR 7047 2 C. But with a lack of reliable supply lines into the system, the Wolves are relying on the galactic community for help in amassing the necessary materials.

The Jonai Merchant's Guild has been authorised to oversee the appeal, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver titanium, beryllium, explosives, aluminium and palladium to Grant Dock in the HR 7047 system. The Wolves of Jonai have also placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 9th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Feeding California
The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has announced plans to establish an agricultural facility in the Synuefai LX-R d5-28 system, with the aim of supporting the Alliance and Turner Research Group outposts in the California Nebula.

To support this goal, the organisation has asked the galactic community to deliver terrain enrichment systems, crop harvesters and auto fabricators to Hansford's Landing in the BD+22 4939 system. Commanders who support the campaign will be generously compensated.

Saool Aledon, a senior operative in the Spinward Marches, released the following statement:

« We are well aware of the challenges involved in supporting outposts far from the core systems. We want to leverage our expertise to support the Alliance's operations in the California Nebula, and we hope we have the support of the galactic community. »

The campaign begins on the 9th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Operation Andronicus Concludes
Admiral Aden Tanner has confirmed that Operation Andronicus has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by taking to their ships to deliver a strategic blow to the Thargoids in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Aden Tanner released a statement:

« The operation's success proves that small ships, when piloted by seasoned Commanders, are our best hope of addressing the Thargoid threat, at least for the present. Every pilot who took part in this initiative has my sincere gratitude. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.


* Galactic News: Taipan AX1 Announced
A spokesperson for Faulcon DeLacy has announced that the manufacturer has teamed up with Aegis to produce a new version of its popular fighter, the Taipan. The spokesperson confirmed that the development was a direct response to the rising Thargoid threat.

Barr Winters, a Faulcon DeLacy engineer who worked on the new Taipan, elaborated on the ship's specifications:

« The new Taipan has been equipped with two AX multi-cannons, replacing the default utility mount and small hardpoints. These cannons are slightly punchier than standard, which we hope will make the ship particularly effective against Thargoid vessels. »

The new Taipan, which will be known as the AX1, is not to be confused with the existing Aegis Taipan variant. The ship will be available from the 13th of November 3303.


* Galactic News: Black Fleet Takes Control of Tiliala
The GalNet News Agency has learned that the Black Fleet, an independent organisation formerly based in Varpet, has become the dominant faction in the Tiliala system.

The news is significant because access to the system \u2013 which was previously controlled by the Conservatives of Tiliala \u2013 is dependent on the possession of a permit.

It is understood that the right to grant access to the system is now shared by both the Black Fleet and the Conservatives of Tiliala.

Lanquo Parkes, an expert in territorial disputes, offered the following assessment:

« This is a highly unusual situation, but the Black Fleet expended considerable effort to take control of Tiliala, and it is only right that it be able to control access to the system. The Conservatives of Tiliala have retained the right to issue permits, but they now have only a marginal presence in Tiliala, having relocated to a Wells-class Carrier in nearby Akandinigua. »

The Conservatives have secured the support of various corporate and political partners to ensure their new asset does not fall into enemy hands. One of these partners, who elected to remain anonymous, said:

« We do not want to see our friends suffer any further losses. We have therefore taken steps to ensure their new home, Tiliala's Lament, cannot be taken from them. »


* Galactic News: Message Found in Celaeno
A number of news feeds have reported the discovery of an intriguing message in the Celaeno system. The message, which was recovered from a listening post, apparently contains an emergency broadcast from the Aida, a Hogan-class cargo vessel.

The precise nature of the message has not been confirmed, and it is not known if security forces in Celaeno have investigated the issue.


* Galactic News: Previously Unseen Thargoid Ships in Electra
Recent reports indicate that a new kind of Thargoid vessel has been encountered in the Electra system. The previously unseen ships were encountered by independent pilots investigating the wreckage of the Aida, a Hogan-class cargo vessel that was apparently attacked by Thargoids.

The Thargoid ship has been classified as a 'Basilisk' Interceptor by the Pilots Federation.

System security forces in Electra offered the following assessment:

« The Basilisk hits harder than the Cyclops, and it's tougher too. It also deploys a denser swarm of Thargons. Interestingly, all the Basilisks we've encountered are heavily scarred, almost as if they've been around longer, taken more punishment. »

Authorities in Electra have warned those living in the system to exercise extreme caution, and not to engage Thargoid ships under any circumstances.


* Galactic News: Wolves of Jonai Appeal Concludes
The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced that its campaign to build an asteroid base among the rings of HR 7047 2 C has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering construction materials to Grant Dock, and by eliminating agitators in the HR 7047 system.

A spokesperson for the Wolves of Jonai released the following statement:

« Thanks to the Commanders who contributed materials to the Wolves of Jonai, the construction of our new asteroid base is now assured. Central Command extends its thanks to the pilots involved. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Grant Dock in the HR 7047 system.


* Community Goal: Breakfast at Tranquillity
The people of the Leesti system are not the only ones celebrating this week. The Guardians of Tranquillity have announced plans to host a food festival in the Tarach Tor system, prompting criticism from Independent Leesti for Equality, which is coordinating a similar event in Leesti. The Guardians of Tranquillity have strenuously denied that the event is an attempt to upstage Independent Leesti for Equality.

Guardians of Tranquillity spokesperson General Hunter O'Brien released the following statement:

\The 'Breakfast at Tranquillity' food festival will showcase the very best regional cuisine, together with libations from Tarach Tor's many fine vineyards and breweries. In addition to these delicacies, we are hoping to be able to offer foods from the Lave sector of space, and have placed an open order for various rare goods.\

In support of the event, the Guardians of Tranquillity have promised to reward pilots who deliver Azure Milk, Diso Ma Corn, Lavian Brandy, Uszaian Tree Grubs and Orrerian Vicious Brew to the Tranquillity starport in the Tarach Tor system.

The campaign begins on the 16th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: California Campaign Concludes
Civility Marks, the Chief Security Officer for the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern, has announced that the organisation's campaign to establish an agricultural facility in the Synuefai LX-R d5-28 system has reached a successful conclusion, thanks to support from the space-faring community. Construction of the facility is expected to begin within the next few weeks.

The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has extended its gratitude to those who supported the initiative, and invited them to try Morrina or Badfort Tea when returning to Hansford's Landing.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Hansford's Landing in the BD+22 4939 system.


* Community Goal: Lunch in Leesti
Food lovers from across the galaxy will converge on George Lucas Station in the Leesti system this week in anticipation of a one-of-a-kind gastronomic festival.

'Lunch in Leesti' is a week-long celebration of Leesti's finest restaurants and wineries, offering attendees a chance to sample food prepared by the Master Chefs of Noti.

In addition to enjoying various regional dishes, guests will have an opportunity to sample a range of intergalactic delicacies, imported at great expense by the event organisers, Independent Leesti for Equality. The organisation has placed an open order for Aepyornis Eggs, Ceti Rabbits, Tanmark Tranquil Tea, Tarach Spice and Utgaroar Millennial Eggs, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these rare commodities to George Lucas Station in Leesti.

Aide Elias Hampton, a spokesperson for Independent Leesti for Equality, announced:

\Independent Leesti for Equality is proud to sponsor this year's Leesti food festival, and will gladly reimburse pilots who supply us with the requested goods.\

The campaign begins on the 16th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Galactic Authorities Call for Calm
As reports continue to pour in of Thargoid attacks, the galaxy's leaders have issued statements urging the public to remain calm.

In a missive released to a number of news feeds, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

« It is true that the Thargoids represent a pertinent threat, but it is important that we understand the scale of this threat. At present, they are active only in the Pleiades Nebula, and there is no reason to believe they will spread beyond this area. Indeed, it is entirely possible that they lack the numbers to do so. »

Federation President Zachary Hudson adopted a similar stance, while making an allusion to Federal-Imperial solidarity:

« They haven't set foot outside the Pleiades, and if they do, we have the means to deal with them. With the Federation and the Empire working together, there is no enemy we cannot overcome. The galactic community has nothing to fear. »

But the buoyancy of these statements was undercut by Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, who offered the following assessment to The Federal Times:

« We have no intelligence regarding the Thargoids' long-term plans, and it would be premature \u2013 if not irresponsible \u2013 to assert that they will remain in the Pleiades. I can assure you, however, that this is a matter Aegis is actively investigating. »

* Community Goal: Fifth Aegis Initiative
Aegis has announced a second military strike on a Thargoid-occupied system, following the success of Operation Andronicus. The operation will focus on Electra, where high concentrations of Thargoid vessels have been reported.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, elaborated on the nature of the operation:

\We have two primary objectives: To reduce the number of Thargoid vessels operating in Electra, and to gather Thargoid material with which to test and calibrate our anti-Thargoid technologies.\

Aegis Research has promised to reward pilots who hand in Pilots Federation Combat Bonds at Cavaleiri in the Electra system.

The campaigns begin on the 23rd of November and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

* Community Goal: Rogue Runners Appeal
The Rogue Runners, an independent group based in the Run system, have announced plans to restore and expand Leif Enterprise, an asteroid base in their home system. The organisation has expressed hope that the renovated base will become a manufacturing centre for high-end ships and modules.

Autumn Leif, the founder of Rogue Runners Co., released the following statement:

« We have always worked hard to ensure that our customers have the goods they need. With demand for both ships and components rising, we need this base to be fully functional. We hope that by reinforcing the superstructure with meta-alloys, we can make the base resistant to the harmful effects of Thargoid Sensors. »

In support of this goal, the organisation has placed an open order for Meta-Alloys, Platinum and Building Fabricators, promising to reward contractors who deliver these goods to Smithport in the Run system. The Rogue Runners have also placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list, to ensure that those delivering goods to Smithport can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 30th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Fifth Aegis Campaign Concludes
An Aegis spokesperson has confirmed that the organisation's campaign in the Electra system has come to an end. The operation was designed to reduce the number of Thargoids operating in the system, and to gather Thargoid material for Aegis's ongoing research and development programme.

The spokesperson released the following statement:

« The recovered Thargoid materials will be used to test larger versions of the AX dumbfire missile and AX Multi-Cannon, which will soon be made available to the galactic community at planetary military bases. Our thanks go to those who supported this operation. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cavalieri in the Electra system.


* Galactic News: New Aegis Initiative
Aegis has announced plans to dramatically expand its research division with the creation of over twenty new laboratories, situated at starports across the galaxy.

Professor Alba Tesreau, Aegis's chief scientific advisor, gave the following statement to The Imperial Herald:

« We must do everything we can to further our understanding of the Thargoids. That's why these new research centres are so important. Everything we can learn about the Thargoids' history, biology and psychology is of potential value. »

« If we could understand the Thargoids \u2013 really understand them \u2013 perhaps we could broker some kind of truce. I, for one, have not given up on the idea of peace. »

« Over the past few months, we have conducted a massive recruitment drive to secure some of the galaxy's best and brightest minds. Now it's time to find out what those minds can accomplish. »

The starports involved in the initiative include:

Arc's Faith, HR 1183

* Galactic News: Aegis Initiative off to a Promising Start
Reports from the Taygeta system indicate that Aegis's new research programme is already bearing fruit.

Professor Boden Tench, principal researcher at Titan's Daughter, offered the following statement to Universal Scientist:

« We're currently focusing on the Thargoid Probes and Sensors, and we've already learned a great deal about the way the Thargoids transmit and store information. »

« We've also been studying the star maps found inside Thargoid structures. We still don't know the precise purpose of these maps, but our analysis has revealed some intriguing details about how the Thargoids categorise geographical data. Indeed, it's entirely possible that their concepts of territory differ dramatically from our own. »


* Galactic News: Rogue Runners Appeal Concludes
The Rogue Runners have announced that their campaign to renovate an asteroid base in Run has received the unalloyed support of the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Smithport, the organisation's base of operations. The initiative was supported by scores of independent combat pilots, who protected those delivering goods to the starport.

Autumn Leif, the founder of Rogue Runners Co., released the following statement as the campaign drew to a close:

\I would like to thank the galactic community for supporting this initiative. We now have everything we need to repair and upgrade Leif Enterprise, which should soon be offering a large selection of ships and modules. This would not have been possible without the help of Rogue Security and the galaxy's independent combat pilots, who provided outstanding protection. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Smithport in the Run system.


* Community Goal: The Colonia Exodus
Despite the repeated assurances of the galactic authorities, which have endeavoured to downplay the scale of the Thargoid threat, it is clear that many of those in the core systems feel less than secure. This is evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to Colonia, eager to escape the Thargoids.

In response to this development, the Colonia Council issued the following statement:

\Colonia has always been a haven, and we would never deny entry to those fleeing danger. But if we are to provide people with homes and employment, we must build. We have therefore made plans to establish a number of new outposts throughout Colonia, to support our new neighbours.\

\Unfortunately, the urgency of the situation means we cannot rely on our usual trade partners, and we are therefore turning to the galactic community for support. We have placed an open order for a range of construction materials, and have set aside considerable premiums for pilots who deliver these goods to Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar system.\

The campaigns begin on the 7th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Diamond Frogs Campaign
The Diamond Frogs, a mercenary outfit based on the lawless fringes of the Capricorni sector, have announced plans to build a new installation in the 63 G. Capricorni system.

The faction's current base of operations has become virtually uninhabitable, as its power and cooling systems have been pushed past their limits.

In support of this goal, the faction has placed an open order for Beer, Liquor, Coffee, Legal Narcotics, Computer Components, Power Generators and Superconductors. They have promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system.

The campaign begins on the 7th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Colonia Campaign Concludes
The Colonia Council has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering materials to Skvortsov Orbital, and by eliminating agitators in the 63 G. Capricorni system. The materials will be used to construct new outposts in the Colonia region to support a recent influx of immigrants.

As the campaign drew to a close, the Colonia Council issued the following statement:

« Colonia has always enjoyed the support of the galactic community, and the success of this initiative proves this support has not diminished. We will now set to work creating homes and employment opportunities for our new friends and neighbours. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system.


* Galactic News: Galactic Leaders Condemn INRA
Following the discovery of further INRA outposts, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval and Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon have issued statements denouncing the now-defunct INRA.

Speaking from the Imperial Palace on Capitol, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

« What the INRA records underscore is that even when faced with dire threats, we cannot abandon our principles. Evidently, the INRA crossed ethical boundaries in its pursuit of victory. Defending civilisation cannot come at the cost of our humanity. »

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon added the following:

« While the INRA records are indeed disturbing, it was the account of John Jameson that troubled me most. Here we have a man \u2013 who evidently did a great deal to defend civilisation from the Thargoids \u2013 who was deceived, manipulated and ultimately murdered by the INRA. »

« I am aware of concerns that Aegis could continue in the same vein. Fortunately, Aegis is bound by the strictest possible codes of conduct. We will not make the same mistakes. »

Meanwhile, the descendents of those affected by the INRA's activities are reportedly investigating the possibility of legal action. Legal experts have advised that such efforts are unlikely to yield results, however, given the amount of time that has passed.


* Galactic News: Diamond Frogs Campaign Concludes
The Diamond Frogs have announced that their campaign to construct an installation in the 63 G. Capricorni system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. This has resulted in a massive influx of deliveries to Skvortsov Orbital, the organisation's base of operations.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G Capricorni system.


* Galactic News: Starports Attacked by Thargoids
Recent reports indicate that several starports in the Pleiades have been attacked by Thargoids. The attacks have resulted in significant damage and hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 of deaths.

Galactic authorities have confirmed that the affected starports are Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system, Liman Legacy in HIP 16753, and the Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.

It is understood that the attacks were executed by a previously unseen class of Thargoid craft classified as an Interceptor Medusa. Footage from starport security feeds indicate that the Thargoid ships used their shutdown fields to neutralise station defences before targeting the main reactor. One eyewitness said, « It's like they wanted to cripple us rather than destroy us outright. »

Authorities in the affected systems have responded with appeals for food, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics. They have also implored independent pilots to support relief operations by evacuating civilians from the starports.

Responding to the development, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

« Our thoughts are with those affected by these attacks. While I have every confidence that system authorities will be able to address the situation, the Empire is ready to help if necessary. »


* Community Goal: Panum Pisciumque
Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced plans to build a Dionysus-class Agricultural Vessel in support of ongoing resource-extraction operations in the Pleiades. Once built, the enormous starship will orbit a water world in the Pleiades Sector GW-W c1-15 system.

In support of this operation, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed an open order for marine equipment, micro controllers, crop harvesters and coltan, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Potagos Port in the Wangal system.

The campaign begins on the 14th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Community Goal: Operation Whirling Dervish
The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has embarked on a campaign to establish a new Coriolis starport in the Ogmar system. The campaign \u2013 dubbed Operation Whirling Dervish \u2013 is designed to support further expansion in the Colonia region.

Lou Brady, a spokesperson for the organisation, released the following statement:

\The new starport will be able to accommodate more people, produce high-tech goods, and service larger vessels, making it an ideal platform for future activity in Colonia.\

The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has placed an open order for atmospheric processors, CMM composites, indium, tantalum and thermal cooling units, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Dervish Platform in the Ogmar system.

The campaign begins on the 14th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Colonia Campaign Concludes
The Colonia Council has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering materials to Pilkington Orbital, and by eliminating agitators in the Einheriar system. The materials will be used to construct new outposts in the Colonia region to support a recent influx of immigrants.

As the campaign drew to a close, the Colonia Council issued the following statement:

« Colonia has always enjoyed the support of the galactic community, and the success of this initiative proves this support has not diminished. We will now set to work creating homes and employment opportunities for our new friends and neighbours. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar system.


* Galactic News: Lakon Announces New Ship
The Alliance has commissioned Lakon Spaceways to produce a new ship in response to the recent Thargoid attacks in the Pleiades. The vessel, which has been named the Type-10 Defender, represents a comprehensive revision of the Type\u20139 Heavy.

Lakon issued the following statement:

« The Type-10 boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout. We envisage it being particularly effective in combat situations. »

The development is significant in that it represents the first overtly military response from the Alliance to the rising Thargoid threat.

Lakon has committed to an aggressive production schedule that should see the Type-10 reaching retailers next week.


* Galactic News: Authorities Urge Public Not to Panic
Following the devastating news that the Thargoids have attacked three starports in the Pleiades, authorities in the Taygeta system, home to one of the affected stations, have released the following statement:

« Our priorities remain getting civilians to safety and securing the commodities we need to stabilise the starport. Independent pilots are encouraged to deliver foods, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics to Titan's Daughter and other affected stations. »

« The important thing is not to panic. The situation, although critical, is in hand. »

It is currently unclear why the pertinent starports were targeted by the Thargoids, but Aegis is investigating the issue.


* Galactic News: Starport Campaign Reaches Successful Conclusion
A spokesperson for the GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has announced that its appeal for construction materials has been earnestly received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge number of deliveries to Dervish Platform, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to build a new Coriolis starport in the Ogmar system.

The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has offered sincere thanks to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dervish Platform in the Ogmar system.


* Galactic News: Angeli Imperial Enterprises Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Potagos Port, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to build a Dionysus-class Agricultural Vessel in support of ongoing resource-extraction operations in the Pleiades.

Angeli Imperial Enterprises has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Potagos Port in the Wangal system.


* Galactic News: Type-10 Defender Now Available

The vessel boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9 Heavy on which it is based, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout.

The Type-10 has been developed primarily in response to the recent Thargoid attacks in the Pleiades, and Lakon has said it envisages the ship « being particularly effective in combat situations ».


* Community Goal: Core Dynamics Campaign
Core Dynamics, one of the galaxy's largest starship manufacturers, has announced a new construction initiative in response to the rise in Thargoid attacks.

A spokesperson for Core Dynamics released the following statement:

\The number of ships lost to Thargoid attacks is increasing rapidly, leaving us with no option but to accelerate our production schedule. But we cannot do this without the support of the galactic community.\

Guaras Blue Creative Partners have agreed to oversee the initiative, asking pilots to deliver titanium, power converters and superconductors to Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system. When the campaign officially ends on the 28th of December 3303, a discount of up to 20 per cent will be applied to the Federal Dropship, Federal Gunship and Federal Assault Ship for one week. Additionally, the rank requirements for those ships will be temporarily lifted.

The campaign begins on the 21st of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: More Starports Attacked
News feeds have confirmed that three further starports have been attacked by Thargoids. The affected stations are Hudson Observatory in HIP 17694, Cavalieri in Electra and Bao Landing in HIP 17497. The attacks have resulted in significant damage and hundreds of casualties.

As with last week's attacks, the strikes were executed by Interceptor Medusas \u2013 a particularly devastating class of Thargoid attack ship.

Authorities in the affected systems have entreated independent pilots to support relief operations by evacuating civilians from the affected starports. They have also appealed for food, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics.


* Community Goal: Rescue Operation in the California Nebula
The Alliance has reported that ships travelling to and from its California Nebula outposts are coming under attack from pirates. The attacks are of such frequency and ferocity that the bases are in danger of being completely cut off.

An Alliance spokesperson said:

\The systems lining the route to the California Nebula are strewn with the wrecks of Alliance vessels, but with the pirates still an active threat, we have been unable to recover escape pods from these shipwrecks. We are therefore launching a two-pronged operation designed to both thin the pirates' numbers and recover the escape pods. We hope we can rely on the support of the galaxy's independent combat pilots.\

The operation has received financial support from the Turner Research Group, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver escape pods to Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Core Dynamics Campaign Concludes
Core Dynamics has announced that its construction initiative has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering construction materials to Klimuk Ring, and by eliminating agitators in the Guaras system. The materials will be used to support a new wave of manufacture to replace ships lost in Thargoid attacks.

A spokesperson for Core Dynamics released the following statement:

« We are immensely grateful to the galactic community for its support. The acceleration of our production schedule has already begun, and our new ships should be rolling off the production line soon. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system.


* Galactic News: Further Migration to Colonia
Although the Thargoid attacks have so far been confined to the Pleiades Nebula, many apparently fear that the aliens' next target will be the core systems. This is evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to Colonia.

The Colonia Council, the region's governing body, has confirmed that the number of refugees has skyrocketed in recent weeks, and that the recent attacks against starports have only accelerated the rate of immigration.

Magen Wolfe, a spokesperson for the Council, said:

« All who seek sanctuary in Colonia will be welcomed, but the truth is that the core systems are no more likely to be targeted by the Thargoids than Colonia. We want to offer our support, but there is a limit to how many people the region can support.\

A campaign to build additional outposts in Colonia took place earlier this month, but the pace of immigration means that further construction initiatives may be necessary to support the region's rapidly expanding population.


* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes
The Alliance has announced that its operation to reclaim the supply lines connecting its California Nebula bases with the core systems has reached a successful conclusion.

The campaign received the support of hundreds of independent pilots, who eliminated the pirates targeting the supply lines and recovered escape pods from ships destroyed by the agitators. Those rescued from the shipwrecks are now recovering at Darwin Research Facility.

As the campaign drew to a close, the Alliance released a statement:

« We are immeasurably grateful to those who participated in this operation \u2013 you have saved our allies from a terrible fate. »

« A pertinent question remains unanswered, however. Where did these criminals come from? Alliance intelligence has surmised that they may have been driven out of their home systems by a second group of agitators. If this is the case, this latter group could represent an even greater threat to civilised space. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.


* Community Goal: Dionysus Rising
Sirius Inc has announced plans to construct a flight-operations megaship in the 42 n Persei system, which occupies a strategic position on the route to Maia. The vessel, which will be named the Dionysus, will dramatically improve services in 42 n Persei.

Senior Aide Humberto Guthrie, speaking on behalf of Sirius Inc, released the following statement:

« We are disturbed by recent events in the Pleiades and the vulnerability of our systems. If the superpowers cannot protect us, we will protect ourselves. »

In support of this campaign, Sirius Inc has placed an open order for various commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Green Enterprise in the Ngalia system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities to Green Enterprise can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 4th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic News: Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are on the brink of closure:

Finney Ring, Jitabos

Barjavel Station, HIP 33368

The Pit, Pennsylvania


* One Year On
It has now been a year since the Thargoids returned to human-occupied space, and in that time they have become increasingly aggressive, their hostility culminating in starport attacks in the Pleiades Nebula.

Now that the Thargoids' intentions have been made clear, the question many are asking is « what can we do? »

Outspoken political commentator Daxton Sung offered the following analysis:

« The situation continues to escalate and our leaders continue to offer the same tired platitudes \u2013 militaristic bombast from Hudson, noncommittal banalities from Lavigny-Duval and earnest sympathising from Mahon. It's clear that they have no idea how to counter the Thargoid threat, beyond pumping more money into Aegis's weapons programme. »


* The Liberation of HIP 17692
In a move that has come as a surprise to many, the Empire and Federation have announced a joint initiative to counter Thargoid activity in the HIP 17692 system.

The two-pronged operation will seek to reduce the Thargoid presence in the region, and to recover personal effects, data and people from Thargoid attack sites in HIP 17692.

The Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been authorised to oversee the combat operation, while The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has been charged with coordinating the rescue initiative. Pilots who support these campaigns will be eligible for substantial rewards.

Following the announcement, Admiral Denton Patreus released the following statement:

« Starports throughout the Pleiades have been attacked. Thousands of lives have been lost. And we have failed to deliver an effective response. That changes now. »

« This is your chance to deliver a message to our enemies \u2013 to tell them that we will not yield and we will not break. We will fight! »

The campaign begins on the 11th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Sirius Inc Campaign Concludes
Sirius Inc has announced that its construction initiative has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Green Enterprise in the Ngalia system, and by eliminating agitators in Ngalia, thereby ensuring the safety of traders contributing to the initiative.

Sirius Inc has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Green Enterprise in the Ngalia system.


* New Technology from Aegis
Aegis has expanded its roster of anti-Thargoid technologies with a new device \u2013 the decontamination limpet. The device is specifically designed to counter the caustic properties of Thargoid missiles.

In a statement, an Aegis spokesperson said:

« As we know, the Thargoids' enzyme missiles are particularly dangerous because of the caustic damage they inflict. The decontamination limpet is designed to address this by stripping the corrosive enzymes from a ship's hull while also performing limited repairs. »

« We have rigorously field tested the device and are confident that it will give pilots a distinct defensive advantage. »

The decontamination limpet can be purchased from planetary bases with military, high-tech, refinery, industrial or extraction-level economies.


* Thargoid Assault Continues
Reed's Rest in Merope and Obsidian Orbital in Maia are the latest starports to be targeted by the Thargoids.

Authorities in the affected systems have appealed to independent pilots to deliver foods, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics, and to evacuate civilians from the pertinent starports.

The attack against Obsidian Orbital is likely to dismay the galactic community, as the starport \u2013 the result of a community initiative involving thousands of pilots \u2013 is seen by many as a symbol of unity.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

* Simbad Regime Campaign
The Simbad Regime was established over a year ago, and has enjoyed consistent growth with the support of Commanders across the galaxy. Now the group has announced plans to construct a new asteroid base among the rings of Nu Tauri 5.

In support of this goal, the Simbad Regime has placed an open order for quantities of explosives, beryllium, aluminium and tea.

A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement:

« In order to secure the support of the galactic community, we are offering generous rewards to pilots who deliver materials to Parmitano Terminal in the Nu Tauri system. »

The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Eliminating Slavers in Guuguyni
Princess Aisling Duval has announced plans to fund a peacekeeping operation in the Guuguyni system. The operation's primary purpose is to neutralise an illegal slave-trading ring in the region.

Princess Duval released the following statement, elaborating on the nature of the campaign:

\Illegal slavery is an abhorrent practice that negates its victim's fundamental human rights. The amoral profiteers operating in Guuguyni must be stopped.\

The Guuguyni Empire Consulate has been authorised to oversee the campaign, and has pledged to reward pilots who hand in bounty vouchers at Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system.

The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* HIP 17692 Operation Concludes
Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the HIP 17692 system has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids in the system and by rescuing people from Thargoid attack sites. Those rescued during the operation are now recovering at Blackmount Orbital.

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Denton Patreus released the following statement:

« This campaign would not have succeeded without the support of the galaxy's independent combat pilots, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude. Thanks are also due to the Merope Expeditionary Fleet and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise for coordinating the campaign. But while we may have won the battle, we still have a long way to go if we are to liberate our galaxy from this alien menace. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system.


* Starport Attacks Continue
Two further starports have fallen prey to Thargoid attack: Kipling Orbital in the Pleiades Sector KC-V C2-11 and Malthus Terminal in the Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41.

As with previous Thargoid assaults, the attacks have caused significant damage and resulted in huge numbers of casualties.

A member of starport personnel at Kipling Orbital offered the following:

« It seems the Thargoids are sweeping the region, moving slowly in the direction of the core systems. But why? »

Authorities in the affected systems have issued requests for help, imploring independent pilots to deliver aid and evacuate civilians.


* Aisling Duval Campaign Concludes
Representatives of Princess Aisling Duval have announced that the Princess's anti-slavery campaign in the Guuguyni system has come to a successful conclusion. Hundreds of independent combat pilots supported the initiative, taking to their ships to neutralise the slave traders operating in the region.

As the campaign drew to a close, Princess Duval released the following statement:

« I am immeasurably grateful to those who supported this campaign. You have saved hundreds of people from a life of misery. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system.


* Restoring Order in Wangal

* Galactic Community Comes to Aid of Dove Enigma
An attempt to sabotage the Dove Enigma, a Wells-class Carrier based in the Colonia system, has been thwarted by the galactic community.

The would-be saboteurs tried to destabilise the vessel by flooding its black market with Thargoid Sensors, which have the capacity to damage ships and starports. Fortunately, the assault was countered by a group of pilots who delivered large quantities of meta-alloys to the ailing ship, thereby stabilising it.

The Dove Enigma was specially commissioned by the Colonia Council as a commemorative gesture for the pilot Commander DoveEnigma13, and as such is of personal significance to many. The ship is also the destination of the Enigma Expedition, a collective mission currently charting a course to the Colonia system.

An engineer stationed at the Dove Enigma gave the following statement:

« We've received more than enough meta-alloys to stabilise the ship, and the surplus will allow us to safeguard against any further sabotage attempts. We're hugely grateful to the pilots who came to our aid. Their efforts are a testament the compassion of the galactic community. »


* Order Restored in Wangal
Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced that its campaign to clear the Wangal system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Authorities in Wangal have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Nelder City in the Wangal system.


* Angeli Imperial Enterprises Campaign Concludes
Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced that its appeal for construction and outfitting materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Nelder City, the organisation's base of operations.

Patrician Mitchell, spokesperson for the organisation, released the following statement:

« Thanks to the efforts of the galaxy's independent pilots, DaMorgs Bar and BBQ will soon be open for business. I can personally recommend the Mortisagus Merlot, the Hazara Stout, the Senor Ping Pinot and the Crighton Cabernet.\

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Nelder City in the Wangal system.


* Alliance Initiative
The Alliance has announced plans to build an Orbis starport in the Synuefai EB-R c7-5 system, between the core systems and the Alliance's outposts in the California Nebula.

Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:

« The remoteness of our California Nebula outposts makes reaching them a potentially dangerous proposition. This new starport will bridge the gap between the settlements and the galactic core, and lessen the risk to ships journeying to and from the California Nebula. »

The initiative is being overseen by the LP 128-32 Corporation, which has placed an open order for various raw materials for use in the construction. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 1st of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Starport Status Update

* Alliance Campaign Comes to an End
The Alliance has announced that its appeal for materials has reached a successful conclusion, having received the unalloyed support of the galactic community. Huge quantities of raw materials were delivered to Bulychev Hub over the past week, which will be used to build an Orbis starport in the Synuefai EB-R c7-5 system.

As the campaign drew to a close, Alliance official Torvan Dast issued a statement, thanking those who supported the campaign and adding:

« By providing Alliance convoys and independent pilots with a much-needed resupply point, we hope this new starport will be the first step in transforming what is currently an outlying enclave into a thriving community. »

Construction of the new starport is expected to begin soon. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Bulychev Hub in the LP 128-32 system.


* Preserving the Sim-Archive
The Utopia movement has announced that the Sim-Archive is to undergo a period of comprehensive maintenance.

Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, elaborated on the nature of the project:

\The Sim-Archive is Utopia's primary achievement \u2013 a vast digital repository containing the collective wisdom of all our departed brothers and sisters. But, like any system, the Archive requires constant maintenance, as a failure in the system could result in the loss of irreplaceable knowledge. We have therefore placed an open order for various commodities for use in this delicate work.\

The Official Airman Di Front has been authorised to oversee the initiative, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Chargaff Orbital in the Airman Di system.

The campaign begins on the 8th of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Ram Tah's Last Hurrah
Ram Tah, the galaxy's foremost expert on the Guardians, has revealed that his research funding will soon end. In an effort to make the most of his remaining finances, the engineer has appealed to independent pilots to deliver Guardian artefacts to his base in the Meene system.

In a statement, Ram Tah said:

\Public interest in the Guardians may have waned, but I believe there is more to learn. Only through thorough investigation and analysis can we hope to fully understand the Guardians, their technology and their relationships to other species. This knowledge could be of great importance to humanity.\

The campaign has received a financial boost from Meene General Industries, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver artefacts from Guardian sites to Felice Dock in the Meene system.

The campaign begins on the 8th of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Galactic Leaders Renew Appeals for Aid
Seventeen starports have now been attacked by the Thargoids, resulting in widespread destruction and loss of life. Many of these stations remain in a critical state, and are unable to offer essential services.

In response, Federal President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval have issued fresh appeals for aid, imploring independent pilots to support relief efforts.

In her announcement, Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:

« Relief coordinators are doing everything they can, but without the support of the galactic community, the restoration of these stations will take a long time. I therefore implore independent pilots to deliver essential commodities to the affected starports, and to evacuate civilians. »

The Emperor also confirmed that Aegis is investigating reports that the Thargoids are moving towards the core systems.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are on the brink of closure:

Taine Landing, Ra


* Utopia Initiative Concludes
A spokesperson for the Utopia enclave has announced that its campaign has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community, resulting in a huge influx of deliveries to Chargaff Orbital. The commodities will be used to perform essential maintenance on the Sim-Archive, a repository of digitised memories.

As the campaign drew to a close, Pranav Antal released the following statement:

« Our thanks go to those who supported this campaign, which will help us safeguard the Sim-Archive for at least another century. But while the Archive is of singular importance, it does not represent the limit of our ambitions. It is my hope that we might one day be able to digitise the human consciousness, thereby transcending our physical selves. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Chargaff Orbital in the Airman Di system.


* Proactive or Reactive?
As the Thargoids continue to wreak havoc in the Pleiades, questions are being asked about the lack of an effective military response.

Gianna Tachibana, an Imperial senator based in the Achenar system, offered the following assessment to The Imperial Herald:

« The Pleiades is at risk of becoming a no-go zone, accessible only to the most courageous Commanders. The formation of militias of independent pilots has unquestionably had an impact, as has the advantage afforded by Aegis's ongoing research. But one cannot escape the feeling that humanity is being reactive, rather than proactive. »

« What is needed is a comprehensive military strategy. The time for a coordinated response is now. »

Meanwhile, authorities in a number of systems have reported that sales of Thargoid-themed novelties, including toys and clothing, have skyrocketed in recent weeks. The manufacture of such merchandise has been condemned by many as insensitive.


* Ram Tah Campaign Concludes
Ram Tah has announced that the galactic community has responded positively to his appeal for Guardian artefacts, resulting in a large number of deliveries to Felice Dock. The engineer will now subject the artefacts to extensive analysis.

As the campaign drew to a close, Ram Tah issued the following statement:

« My heartfelt thanks go to all those who supported this initiative. I've already started work and I should have something to share with you soon. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.


* The Bulwark Project
The Federation has launched an initiative to develop autonomous military hardware with which to fight the Thargoids.

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters shed further light on the initiative, which has been christened the Bulwark Project:

\As the Thargoids' aggression escalates, it's essential that we find ways to minimise casualties while continuing to protect ourselves. Aegis is doing commendable work, but it needn't be our only line of defence.\

Imperial commentators have criticised the initiative, however, drawing attention to long-standing conventions against the development of artificial intelligence. Shadow President Winters was quick to dismiss such concerns, saying:

\The purpose of the Bulwark Project is to investigate alternative defence strategies, not to develop machine intelligence.\

The operation has received financial support from the Momoirent Central and Co, which has placed an open order for various commodities for use in the campaign.

The campaign begins on the 15th of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

* Federal Initiative Concludes
The Federation has announced that the Bulwark Project has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Jahn Dock. These will be used to research the possibility of an automated Federal defence force.

As the campaign drew to a close, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters released a statement:

« My sincere gratitude goes to those who supported this campaign. But I want to remind you that we're still some way from a fully automated defence force. The Bulwark Project's initial remit is simply to establish the economic and military feasibility of such an enterprise. »

Meanwhile, opponents have continued to voice concerns that it could lead to the development of artificial intelligence, which is outlawed throughout the galaxy.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Jahn Dock in the Momoirent system.


* Anti-Thargoid Operation
Following the success of last month's Federal-Imperial operation in the HIP 17692 system, the two superpowers have once again joined forces to combat the Thargoids.

This time, the operation will focus on the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems, where large concentrations of Thargoid ships have been reported.

The purpose of the two-pronged operation is to reduce the Thargoid presence in Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7, and to recover black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites in Arietis Sector XE-Z b4. The former initiative is being overseen by the Merope Expeditionary Fleet, while the latter is being coordinated by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise. Pilots who support these operations will be eligible for substantial rewards.

Admiral Denton Patreus launched the campaign with the following statement:

« We know that militias of experienced combat pilots are particularly effective against the Thargoids, but we must not be complacent. Our enemies are formidable, and we underestimate them at our peril. »

The campaign begins on the 22nd of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Thargoids Targeting Aegis Laboratories
Analytical reports released by Aegis have confirmed a pattern to the Thargoids' recent starport attacks, which have left thousands dead and infrastructures crippled.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, made this statement:

« We have identified that the Thargoids are specifically targeting starports where Aegis laboratories are established. These include Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system, Liman Legacy in HIP 16753 and the Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55. »

« In conjunction with local security services and system authorities, we are increasing defensive measures at all starports where Aegis has a presence. »

Professor Alba Tesreau, the organisation's chief scientific advisor, voiced additional concerns:

« Aegis research centres were set up to increase our understanding of the Thargoids, so it's clear they're attempting to prevent us investigating their technology and artefacts. Naturally we'll take precautions, but I can only wonder what a long-term solution might be. Will we have to establish laboratories in secret locations, such as bunkers or asteroids? Aegis's work is critical \u2013 only through knowledge might we establish a real relationship with this species. »


* Ram Tah Searching for New Guardian Sites
The engineer Ram Tah, a leading expert on the mysterious Guardians, has requested help in locating undiscovered sites from the ancient alien race. He has issued the following statement:

« The artefacts recently delivered to me have been subjected to intense molecular analysis. As a result, I have deduced the possibility of Guardian sites in three specific systems: Col 173 Sector QU-O d6-25, HD 63154 and Synuefe EU-Q c21-10. »

« I urge the galactic community to investigate these systems, where I believe we may find further traces of the Guardians' ancient civilisation. I appreciate that this could be a wild goose chase, but data from such sites \u2013 if they exist \u2013 would be extremely valuable. »

Ram Tah has asked that any data be delivered to him at Phoenix Base in the Meene system.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are on the brink of closure:

Witt Station, Michel

Evangelisti Settlement, Hodack


* Lakon Releases Alliance Chieftain
The Alliance has announced a new combat ship, the Alliance Chieftain, which has been specifically designed to counter the aggression of the Thargoids.

A press release from Lakon Spaceways, which has developed the ship, stated:

« The Chieftain is a highly manoeuvrable vessel for its size and weight, offering an advantage against the renowned agility of Thargoid craft. It boasts six weapon hardpoints and also has three internal military compartments. This makes it very capable in a combat situation, and able to withstand considerable punishment. »

« We believe demand will be high. »

The Alliance Chieftain is now available for purchase.


* Federal-Imperial Operation Concludes
Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems has succeeded in achieving its objectives. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids, and by recovering black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites.

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Denton Patreus released a statement, thanking those who participated.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Orcus Crag in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 system and PRE Logistics Support Beta in the Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 system.


* Arming Colonia
Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has launched a campaign to boost Colonia's military strength by providing the region with weapons. The initiative is a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility.

A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

« Several members of our organisation have friends and family in Colonia, so we've decided to divert some cash into protecting the region. If the Thargoids come knocking, we don't want the people of Colonia to be caught with their pants down. »

Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has placed an open order for a range of weapons, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Gold Hub in the Arek system.

The campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Protecting Colonia
As the Thargoid offensive continues, authorities in Colonia have decided to step up security by building a new security installation in the region.

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the initiative, gave the following statement:

« The Thargoids have now entered the core systems, and their hostility shows no signs of abating. Meanwhile, Colonia's defensive capabilities remain limited. It is clear to us that the time to act has come. »

Colonia has agreed to fund the operation, and has placed an open order for various mined resources for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver the requested resources to Dove Enigma in the Colonia system will be generously compensated.

The campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Reports from independent pilots confirm that a new type of Thargoid vessel has been encountered, both in the Pleiades and on the fringes of the core systems. The ship, designated a Thargoid Scout Marauder by the Pilots Federation, are reported to be more manoeuvrable than the Thargoid Interceptor, but less resistant to weapons fire.

Meanwhile, analytical reports released by Aegis have confirmed a pattern to the Thargoids' recent starport attacks, which have left thousands dead and infrastructures crippled. Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, confirmed that the Thargoids are specifically targeting starports where Aegis laboratories are established. Defensive measures have been increased at all starports where Aegis has a presence.

Authorities in Colonia have decided to step up security by building a new security installation in the region. The Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has launched a parallel campaign to boost Colonia's military strength by providing the region with weapons. Both initiatives are a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility.

Finally, Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems has succeeded in achieving its objectives. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids, and by recovering black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Ram Tah Announces New Discoveries
The engineer Ram Tah has revealed that his recent request for pilots to investigate possible Guardian sites has yielded significant discoveries. He has released this statement:

« Thanks to many courageous Commanders, we have found several new Guardian sites and recovered a great deal of data. As I theorised, the ruins are not as dead as they seem, since some are actively defended by ancient Guardian drones. »

« My analysis of the data has yielded key technological information, much of which can be put to immediate practical use. This has allowed me to produce blueprints for new weaponry and power-plant systems based on Guardian designs. »

« I am currently liaising with technology brokers to manufacture and distribute these devices, which I hope will benefit the galaxy in these troubled times. »

Ram Tah added that he will continue to rely on the galactic community's support in unearthing further knowledge about the Guardians.


* The Guardians: The Galaxy Reacts
There has been a range of reactions to the discovery of new Guardian sites, and to Ram Tah's development of Guardian-inspired technologies.

Federal President Zachary Hudson said: « The Federation congratulates Ram Tah on his success. Anything that helps us defend our citizens from Thargoid aggression is welcome. »

Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus echoed this sentiment: « I am pleased to hear that new, more powerful armaments are being produced. These will provide a tactical advantage in our conflict with the Thargoids. »

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon struck a more balanced tone: « Information is wealth, and Ram Tah's efforts to expand the boundaries of science and knowledge will make us rich indeed. »



Meanwhile, Simguru Pranav Antal of Utopia looked to the future: « There is enormous potential for humanity to benefit from the technology of our galactic predecessors, and we look forward to sharing whatever prosperity these new discoveries may bring. »

Finally, Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, commented: « I have already contacted Ram Tah with the hope that Aegis can study his new data. Understanding more about the Guardians may enhance our knowledge of the Thargoids, and perhaps help us to comprehend their motives. »


* Coalition of Othime Campaign
The Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid base.

A spokesperson for the Coalition said:

« Othime relies heavily on its refineries, but those refineries are limited to small and medium cargo vessels, which limits the amount of revenue we can generate. A new asteroid base would allow us to support large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to compete with other refineries in the sector. »

The organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Colonia Initiative Concludes
The Colonia Council has announced that its campaign to build a security installation in the Colonia region has been warmly received by the galactic community. Large quantities of material were delivered to Dove Enigma over the past week, allowing the initiative to move to the construction phase.

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the campaign, gave the following statement:

« The new installation will help us protect the people of Colonia from the ever-escalating Thargoid threat. Our thanks go to those who supported the campaign. »


* Arek Crimson Vision Corporation Campaign Ends
A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has announced that its appeal for weapons has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to the organisation's base of operations. The weapons will now be shipped to the Colonia region.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation issued a statement thanking those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Gold Hub in the Arek system.


* Thargoid Surveillance in the Pleiades
Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison at Aegis, made this statement:

« Our new Eagle Eye initiative will closely monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist. »

« We have established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades, which will measure energy-level fluctuations and track ship movements. Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis. »

Aegis has confirmed that Eagle Eye installations have been placed in the following systems:

HIP 17225

HIP 17692

HIP 17892

HR 1185

Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55

Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4

Professor Alba Tesreau commented:

« My hope is that this initiative will greatly increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. Observing their 'natural' activities, outside of combat zones, should further our understanding of their behaviour. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Several new Guardian sites have been discovered, resulting in a wealth of fresh information about the Guardians' long-lost civilisation. Some of this information has already been put to practical use by the engineer Ram Tah, who has produced blueprints for new weaponry and power-plant systems based on Guardian designs.

Several galactic figureheads reacted to the news. Federal President Zachary Hudson said: « Anything that helps us defend our citizens from Thargoid aggression is welcome », while Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus expressed hope that the new armaments would « provide a tactical advantage in our conflict with the Thargoids ».

Meanwhile, Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula. The tri-superpower initiative has established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades as part of the Eagle Eye initiative. The installations will monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist.

Finally, the Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid base. The organisation hopes that the new base will allow it to compete with other refineries in the region.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Fresh Knowledge From New Guardian Sites
Following the recent discovery of new Guardian sites, the engineer Ram Tah is seeking help from the galactic community to learn more about the long-lost civilisation.

Further details were outlined in his latest announcement:

« I have developed a decryption algorithm that will translate the codices at Guardian sites. However, pilots are reminded that accessing Guardian data is only possible when in possession of one of their artefacts. »

Pilots can obtain Ram Tah's decryption algorithm from any station in the Meene system other than Felice Dock. The artefacts alluded to by Ram Tah can be found at Guardian sites. Commanders are warned to be on alert, as the sites may be defended by Guardian drones.

Ram Tah also stated: « I will be more than pleased to reimburse any pilot who successfully returns to the Meene system with a complete series of Guardian logs. There is so much more for us to discover about the Guardians and their history, and this could be a significant turning point in our understanding. »


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are currently closed:

Neumann Camp, Shinrarta Dezhra

So-yeon Hub, Coma

Meanwhile, the following starports are on the brink of closure:

Onnes Gateway, LFT 37


* The Purge of Socho
Following reports of Thargoid incursions into the core systems, Aegis Core has launched a counter-Thargoid operation in the Socho region.

A spokesperson for Aegis Core gave the following statement to the media:

« The goal is simple: Take out Thargoid vessels, gather up the pieces, and deliver them to Dantec Enterprise. We don't know as much about the Scouts as we do the Interceptors, so we want to compare materials from both variants and find out what they are made of. »

Aegis Core has appealed to independent pilots to support the operation by destroying Thargoids in Socho and by delivering Bio-Mechanical Conduits, Propulsion Elements and Weapon Parts to Dantec Enterprise. Commanders who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on the 15th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Coalition of Othime Campaign Concludes
The Coalition of Othime has announced that its campaign to build a new asteroid base has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the appeal by delivering commodities to Levi Montalcini Dock and by eliminating agitators in Othime, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Authorities in Othime have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Levi-Montalcini Dock in the Othime system.


* Thargoid Surveillance Continues
According to Aegis, their operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula has already begun to show results.

Aegis released the following statement on behalf of Admiral Aden Tanner, their chief military liaison:

« The new Eagle Eye installations are a success, they have identified fluctuations in Thargoid transmissions from a number of planet side structures. With the invaluable help of the members of the Pilots Federation we have identified that the new signals are pointing to locations in human space. We believe these to be identifying the location of potential Thargoid attacks and if this is proved to be the case it will be a huge break through and a validation of our work here.

We continue to monitor the Thargoid activity using the Eagle Eye installations in the Pleiades and have confirmed reports that the Eagle Eye installations have detected new signals. We urge all available pilots to investigate these changes to see if we can thwart the Thargoids. »


* Non Human Signal Sources in Huveang De
Local security services in the Huveang De system have announced today that there have been no new sightings of Thargoids over the last 24 hours.

The head of local security forces released the following statement:

« We do not know why the Thargoids appeared in our region of space or why they now appear to have left. We can only speculate as to their motives. However we thank all the brave pilots that came to the system to help defend against this potentially catastrophic threat. »

There is speculation that the Thargoids planned to attack the system and were held back by the influx of combat pilots engaging them, while others claim that the Thargoids might be exploring or looking for resources and have simply moved on.

While no one has reported any further sighting in nearby systems, security forces in the region remain on high alert.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are on the brink of closure:

Elion Platform, Kamahu

Corte-Real Terminal, 19 Phi-2 Ceti

Kurland Hub, Belarsuk

Paulmier de Gonneville Escape, Col 285 Sector MJ-G c11-25

Boe Orbital, Abast Samo


* Socho Operation Complete
The operation to clear Socho of Thargoids has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoid vessels in the system, and by delivering alien material to Dantec Enterprise.

A spokesperson for Aegis Core, which oversaw the initiative, made the following statement:

« The pilots who took part in the operation have my thanks \u2013 they showed some real mettle. I can't promise the material they delivered will lead to any momentous discoveries, but you never know. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.


* Sirius Corp Announces Expansion
The Sirius Corporation has announced that it will be expanding its presence at two locations just outside the core systems.



A spokesperson for Sirius made this statement:

« For some time now, the amount of traffic passing through both the Ceos and Sothis systems has been steadily increasing. Naturally, we are keen to ensure that all pilots have access to essential services. »

« To this end, we are in the process of building several new starports and settlements in these systems, as well as several megaships. These will support Ceos and Sothis's residents and visitors, and provide pilots with the high standard of services that they have come to expect from Sirius Corp. »


* EG Union Campaign
Yuri Grom has announced an initiative to create a new shipyard in the CPC 20 6743 system. The shipyard will produce capital ships with which to defend human space from both human and alien threats.

The EG Union, acting on behalf of Yuri Grom, has placed an open order for various commodities to build the shipyard, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that pilots delivering commodities can do so safely.

The spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

« Recent events have demonstrated that humanity is not prepared for a possible Thargoid invasion. Building a shipyard for Farragut-class ships is the first step in establishing a defensive perimeter. »

« It is essential that traders do not encounter any difficulty when delivering materials, which is why the EG Pilots \u2013 Yuri Grom's elite task force \u2013 have been asked to eliminate any agitators. We are also asking independent combat pilots to help us neutralise any threats. »

The campaign begins on the 22nd of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Thargoid Revelations
Aegis has published a report containing significant insights into the Thargoids. The information was provided by the engineer Ram Tah, compiled from recently decrypted logs found at Guardian sites.

Key extracts from the report are reprinted below:

« The codices indicate that the Thargoids may be an older race than the Guardians, and that the two species share a history of conflict. This hostility was a product of the Thargoids' belief that they had a pre-existing claim to the regions of space occupied by the Guardians. »

« The Guardians attempted to communicate with the Thargoids, but these efforts ended in failure. They determined that the Thargoids' survival instincts were so strong that they could not tolerate any potential threat, including the proximity of another space-faring civilisation. »

« It is now clear that the Guardians' defensive drones and advanced weaponry were developed principally to protect their worlds from the Thargoids. Although details are scant, it seems these war machines eventually succeeded in repelling the Thargoids. »

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, publicly commented on the report:

« Thanks to Ram Tah and the brave pilots who explored Guardian sites, some of our questions about the Thargoids have been answered. It is clear that our current situation echoes that of the Guardians. Our space, like theirs, was seeded with barnacles thousands of years ago, and now the Thargoids have arrived to reap the biomechanical harvest. »

« We now know that the purpose of the Thargoids' ongoing military offensive is to remove humanity from what they consider their territory. If the Thargoids adopt the same modus operandi as with the Guardians, their next move will be to start aggressively mining mineral resources. There is no evidence this has yet begun, however. »

Ram Tah has also made a statement about the impact of the findings:

« Until now, the Thargoids have been shrouded in mystery, and their objectives have been unclear. For the first time, we have an insight into what drives them, why they are attacking us, and what their overall goals are. This is a historically significant discovery that I believe will make a huge difference to this conflict, and perhaps to humanity's survival. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Aegis has published a report containing significant insights into the Thargoids. The information was provided by the engineer Ram Tah, compiled from recently decrypted logs at Guardian sites. The report indicates that the Guardians and the Thargoids were once at war, due to the Thargoids' belief that they had a pre-existing claim to the regions of space occupied by the Guardians. Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, said: « It is clear that our current situation echoes that of the Guardians. Our space, like theirs, was seeded with barnacles thousands of years ago, and now the Thargoids have arrived to reap the biomechanical harvest. »

The Aegis report has elicited a wide range of responses. Federal President Zachary Hudson said, « It is now clear that there is no reasoning with this alien menace », while Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus commented, « This new information makes it clear that the Thargoids will reject any diplomatic overtures. We must redouble our efforts to defend ourselves from their antagonism. »

Meanwhile, the operation to clear Socho of Thargoids has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoid vessels in the system, and by delivering alien material to Dantec Enterprise.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Aegis Thargoid Report Causes Ripples
A recent report from Aegis, outlining the Thargoids' history and their interactions with the Guardians, has elicited a wide range of responses.

A brief statement was released by Federal President Zachary Hudson:

« It is now clear that there is no reasoning with this alien menace. The Federation remains dedicated to wiping out any threat to our citizens. »

Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus adopted a similar viewpoint:

« This new information makes it clear that the Thargoids will reject any diplomatic overtures. We must redouble our efforts to defend ourselves from their antagonism. »

Meanwhile, Professor Palin observed:

« Aegis's report forewarns us, and perhaps forearms us, too. We now know that the Guardians developed technologies capable of resisting the Thargoids' aggression. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to hope that the weaponry being developed by Ram Tah, based on Guardian designs, might help us replicate the Guardians' success, and defeat the Thargoids. »

* Thargoid Sites Go Quiet
Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, has released a statement concerning the Thargoid structures currently under surveillance in the Pleiades Nebula.

« Undoubtedly, the most positive outcome of our Eagle Eye initiative is that it has allowed us to determine which locations the Thargoids intend to attack. This has proved invaluable in our ongoing fight against the Thargoids. »

« It appears, however, that the sites are currently dormant, as no energy-level fluctuations have been detected for several days. Hopefully this means we can look forward to a temporary reprieve from Thargoid attacks. »

« Our military flagships, the Vanguard and the Acropolis, will remain on standby in HIP 21559 and Irandan until needed. »


* Conflict in Ross 310
Conflict has erupted between Ross 310 Natural Services, the controlling faction of the Ross 310 system, and the Ross 310 Cartel, a criminal organisation also based in Ross 310.

It is understood that the Ross 310 Cartel is attempting to overthrow Ross 310 Natural Services and assume control of the system.

Toru Jacobs, a member of Ross 310 Natural Services, issued the following statement:

« The Ross 310 Cartel is well equipped and highly organised, and there's a very real chance they could take control of the system. But the brave men and women of Ross 310 Natural Services are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening. »

Both organisations have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.

Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 29th of March 3304.


* EG Union Campaign Concludes
The EG Union has announced that its campaign to build a shipyard in CPC 20 6743 has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lyakhov Dock, and by eliminating agitators in Ross 720 and surrounding systems, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Aegis has constructed two megaships, the Acropolis and the Vanguard, to help counter the Thargoid threat. These ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations and support independent pilots. Aegis has confirmed that both vessels will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective.

Meanwhile, many members of the Pilots Federation have responded to the recent Aegis report detailing the Thargoids' history. One Commander admitted he was disturbed to discover that the Thargoids had been around for millions of years, and that even the Guardians had found it difficult to stop them. But other pilots were more forthright, with one reminding the galactic community that the Thargoids are not invincible.

In other news, conflict has erupted between Ross 310 Natural Services, the controlling faction of the Ross 310 system, and the Ross 310 Cartel, a criminal organisation also based in the region. It is understood that the Ross 310 Cartel is attempting to overthrow Ross 310 Natural Services and assume control of the system.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Anti-Thargoid Megaships Deployed by Aegis
Aegis has constructed two megaships, the Acropolis and the Vanguard, to help counter the Thargoid threat.

The announcement came from Admiral Aden Tanner, who explained the ships' purpose:

« It is vital that Aegis has a military presence in the theatre of conflict. These new ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations wherever they are deployed, and will support independent pilots. »

« In response to recent Thargoid incursions, the Acropolis has been dispatched to the Lunguni system, while the Vanguard is operating in the Mentor system. However, their key advantage over a starport or base is their mobility, so both will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective. »

Admiral Tanner went on to stress the importance of the development:

« Constructing these two gigantic vessels was a considerable undertaking for Aegis, but we are convinced the expense and effort is worthwhile. Our remit requires us to occupy a guiding role in the resistance against the Thargoids, and these megaships will bring that into focus. »


* Independent Pilots Respond to Thargoid Revelations
Following the recent Aegis report detailing the Thargoids' history, many members of the Pilots Federation have made public statements.

« Everything is different now, » said one Commander. « It was disturbing enough when the Thargoids returned. To find out they've been around for millions of years, and that even the Guardians had trouble stopping them\u2026 It's like being told that the ancient gods, the vengeful ones who smite from above, were real all along. »

Other pilots had more practical concerns about the impact on the galactic community:

« What worries me is when they start up their strip-mining operation, which seems to be on the cards, » said an experienced trader. « I transport ores and metals between dozens of planets. If those planets end up being gutted of minerals, that's my livelihood gone out the airlock. »

There were also emotional comments from those who value space exploration:

« I bought a ship to discover what's out there, you know? To voyage into the black. But now, knowing the Thargoids were there long before us, and might have infested anywhere we go\u2026 The black's theirs already, it was always theirs! »

However, one seasoned Commander struck a belligerent tone:

« All the Aegis report tells us is that these alien scumbags can be beaten. The Guardians did it once \u2013 now it's our turn. I've fought the Thargoids in the Pleiades and I know they're not invincible. With Aegis's new weapons and now their megaships, we can make those insects wish they'd stayed in their hives. »

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately there could be only one victor.

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Morey Port in the Ross 310 system.


* Aisling Duval Criticises Aegis
In a public interview, Princess Aisling Duval levelled criticism at Aegis in relation to the ongoing Thargoid conflict.

« The people are scared, » she said. « They fear that their way of life \u2013 their very existence \u2013 might vanish unless more is done to protect them. I'm not convinced Aegis is capable of doing so. The Empire has invested heavily in the organisation. Are we sure the other powers have done the same? »

« It has taken far too long for Aegis to determine why the Thargoids are attacking, and it's not clear what their strategy is now. If we are to trust them to defend humanity, we need to see more obvious progress. »

Although Princess Duval has received some support for her viewpoint, The Federal Times offered a sarcastic rebuttal:

« Apart from undertaking scientific research, developing defensive systems, producing anti-Thargoid weaponry, creating the Eagle Eye surveillance network, building two military megaships and actively engaging Thargoid forces in combat\u2026what has Aegis ever done for us? »

A media spokesperson for the Alliance was equally dismissive:

« This is nothing more than public posturing \u2013 an attention-seeking gambit from someone who is no longer as newsworthy as she once was. Aegis has made incredible breakthroughs, and is clearly dedicated to ending the Thargoid war. »


* Privateers Alliance Campaign
The Privateers Alliance has announced plans to build a military installation in the HIP 33368 system.

The installation will « reinforce the gates » by defending the core systems from Thargoid forces in the Pleiades.

A spokesperson for the Privateers Alliance released the following statement:

« We need to make a show of strength. That is why we are humbly requesting the help of the galactic community in building this installation. »

« Once complete, it will allow pilots from across the galaxy \u2013 irrespective of their allegiance \u2013 to work together in resisting the Thargoid threat. »

In support of this goal, the Privateers Alliance has placed an open order for various commodities, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Barjavel Station in the HIP 33368 system.

The campaign begins on the 5th April of 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* The ACS Overwatch
The Atlas Corporation has launched a campaign to build a megaship in the Lambda Arae system.

The vessel, which will be named the ACS Overwatch, will fulfil a multi-faceted role in the ongoing fight against the Thargoids.

A spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation said:

« The ACS Overwatch will serve as a coordination point for rescue missions and anti-Thargoid operations, as well as being a valuable resupply point and a safe haven for the people of Lambda Arae. »

In support of this goal, the Atlas Corporation has placed an open order for various commodities, promising to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Redi Market in the Lambda Arae system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities to Redi Market can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 5th of April 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Genesis of the Thargoids?
Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, has published a paper speculating on the origin of the Thargoids.

Extracts from her paper are reprinted below:

« Considering the Thargoids' impact on our civilisation, it is disturbing that we still know so little about them. Information from Guardian sites has shed some light on the Thargoids' ancient history, but it's clear they were an established spacefaring species long before they encountered the Guardians. So where did the Thargoids come from? »

« We know that the Thargoids are insectoid in nature with an affinity for ammonia-based worlds. This suggests they may have evolved in a harsh, low-temperature environment, which might explain their overdeveloped survival instincts and aggressive nature. But we also know the Thargoids are experts in bioengineering, so they may have augmented their own biology to a point where natural evolutionary processes are meaningless. »

« Since much of the Milky Way remains uncharted, the Thargoid homeworld might be just beyond known space or on the other side of the galaxy \u2013 if it exists at all. It's possible they are now a nomadic species, existing entirely in space, or within fabricated hives of some kind. It may even be that they have journeyed across millions of light years, from Andromeda or beyond, like a swarm of locusts seeking fresh crops to consume. »

« Other theories are more esoteric but worthy of exploration. We know that their vessels are capable of hovering in hyperspace, suggesting that witch-space is comfortable for them. Could living beings actually originate from hyperspace? »

« Alternatively, they may be using hyperspace as a conduit from a dimensional plane entirely separate from real space. The Thargoids may not just be extragalactic in origin, but extra-universal. »


* New Designs from Technology Brokers
A range of new Guardian-inspired modules are now available from the galaxy's technology brokers. These modules have been developed by the engineer Ram Tah, following his acquisition of data from Guardian sites.

Pilots can now purchase a Guardian power distributor, a Guardian FSD booster and a Guardian shard cannon. The cannon is available in both fixed and turreted versions.

An independent engineering specialist made this comment:

« These Guardian-human hybrid modules offer additional resilience and firepower \u2013 both very welcome to Commanders flying combat missions. By taking advantage of the Guardians' expertise, we may be able to replicate their success in fighting the Thargoids. »

* Privateer's Alliance Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Privateer's Alliance has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Barjavel Station, the organisation's base of operations.

Construction will now begin on a new military installation in the HIP 33368 system to resist the Thargoid threat.

The Privateer's Alliance has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Barjavel Station in the HIP 33368 system.


* Atlas Corporation Initiative Concludes
A spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation has announced that its campaign to build a megaship in the Lambda Arae system has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Redi Market and by eliminating agitators in Lambda Arae, thereby allowing traders to operate safely.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation released the following statement:

« We would like to thank the pilots who helped us achieve our goal. We appreciate the assistance of each and every one of you. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Redi Market in the Lambda Arae system.


* Rind Gold Electronics Org Campaign
The Empire has announced an initiative to bolster the superpower's military strength. The initiative centres on a new training programme designed to create the next generation of starship pilots.

A spokesperson for the Rind Gold Electronics Org, which is overseeing the initiative, released the following statement:

« Over the past six months, a research group based in Achenar has developed a state-of-the-art training programme designed to cultivate applicants' reflexes, coordination, perception and cognitive abilities. Provisional tests indicate that students in the full flush of youth, unburdened with superfluous knowledge, respond extremely well to the programme, resulting in combat pilots of unprecedented skill. »

In support of this initiative, the Rind Gold Electronics Org has placed an open order for research materials, which will be used to manufacture essential apparatus. The organisation has also issued an appeal for a range of mined resources, which will be used to construct a dedicated training centre for the new programme.

The campaign begins on the 12th of April 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Support for Aisling Duval
Princess Aisling Duval's recent comments about the effectiveness of Aegis have attracted a measure of support.

One of the most prominent figures to express solidarity is Imperial Senator Pal Vespasian, who said:

« One cannot accuse Aegis of being completely ineffective, but perhaps Her Highness has correctly gauged the mood of the people. A handful of minor victories is simply not enough to allay widespread fear of conquest. There can be no half measures in this situation \u2013 if we do not defeat the Thargoids, our civilisation could fall. »

Meanwhile, Commodore Riri McAllister of the Alliance Defence Force said:

« I can certainly refute Princess Duval's suggestion that the other powers have not made equal contributions to Aegis. She makes a good point, however, with regard to military strategy. Greater transparency around Aegis's long-term plans would lead to a more coordinated effort in resisting Thargoid forces. »

Jast Fern\u00e1ndez, chief editor of an independent media outlet, focused on how the public might be starting to view the princess differently:

« We know that Aisling is widely seen as the stereotypical heiress \u2013 materially prosperous but intellectually deficient \u2013 but could this have been a public mask that she is now discarding? Or perhaps the young princess is finally maturing, and developing some genuine critical faculty? Either way, it's no surprise that she's found an audience \u2013 something she has always excelled at. »


* Signal Could be Ancient Probe
Astronomers based in the Sol system may have detected a signal from New Horizons, a space probe launched in 2006 with a mission to study various objects in the Kuiper belt.

One of the astronomers responsible for the find said:

« New Horizons was launched over a thousand years ago, so this is potentially quite an exciting discovery. We haven't been able to pinpoint the object's precise location, but our data indicates that it is approximately 1,726,716 light seconds from the sun and 1,526,050 light seconds from 90377 Sedna. Perhaps some intrepid explorer will seek it out, and confirm our suspicions! »


* Pirates vs Thargoids?
A new independent report suggests that piracy has declined across occupied space since the return of the Thargoids.

Dr Jin Rameer, who runs a socio-political think tank, made the following observations in her report:

« Statistics show a significant reduction in piracy and criminal behaviour since the Thargoid presence was confirmed. But the reason has not come under scrutiny until now. »

« Has the presence of an alien threat dampened felons' appetite for preying on fellow humans? It's widely understood that communities become stronger when faced with a common enemy, so perhaps one positive consequence of the Thargoids' return is the dissolution of barriers between social groups. »

« Alternatively, those attracted to piracy may find a greater \u2013 and less morally troubling \u2013 thrill in turning their weapons on non-human targets. Whether or not their motives are altruistic, criminal elements may be transforming into defenders of the very societies they have previously terrorised. »

But a spokesperson for security forces in the Pegasi Sector responded:

« Dr Rameer needs to get out of her comfortable office and into the black. The Kumo Crew have raided dozens of systems in recent months, taking advantage of the fact that our forces are tied up with the Thargoids. Believe me, Archon Delaine sees the Thargoids as an opportunity, not a common enemy. The pirates don't care if the galaxy burns, as long as their pockets are full. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Princess Aisling Duval's comments about Aegis have attracted a measure of support. One Imperial senator suggested that Duval had « correctly gauged the mood of the people », while another commentator suggested that her comments were a sign of maturity.

Meanwhile, an independent report suggests that piracy has declined since the return of the Thargoids. The author of the report has suggested that the presence of an alien threat has dampened felons' appetite for preying on fellow humans. Security forces in the Pegasi Sector have refuted these suggestions, however.

The Empire has announced plans to build a new training centre for novice pilots, and has placed an open order for research materials and mined resources for use in the construction. Once complete, the centre will be home to a state-of-the-art training programme designed to create the next generation of starship pilots.

In other news, astronomers based in the Sol system may have detected a signal from New Horizons, a space probe launched in 2006 with a mission to study various objects in the Kuiper belt. One of the astronomers responsible for the find gave details of the object's approximate location, and encouraged explorers to seek it out.

Finally, a spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation has announced that its campaign to build a megaship has reached a successful conclusion. A parallel initiative from the Privateers Alliance has also achieved its aims, after the organisation's appeal for commodities was enthusiastically received by the galactic community.

And those are the main stories this week.

The Rind Gold Electronics Org Campaign has announced that its campaign has reached a successful conclusion. Large quantities of research materials and mined resources were delivered to Wegner Market over the past week, allowing the Empire to proceed with the construction of a new pilot-training centre.

A spokesperson for the Rind Gold Electronics Org released the following statement:

« As the dangers facing humanity become more potent, we must not become overly reliant on technology. Instead we must seek to cultivate the human mind, and unlock its boundless potential. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Wegner Market in the Rind system.


* The Rekohu Project
Angeli Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire's key suppliers of foodstuffs and other consumables, has announced plans to build a Bowman-class science vessel.

The construction initiative, dubbed the Rekohu Project, will allow the organisation to increase the biodiversity of its crops. Once complete, the megaship will be deployed to the PLAA AIN Sector to research life on Earth-like worlds.

The organisation's spokesperson, Commander Blain Crighton, released the following statement:

« For a civilisation with near-limitless energy and the ability to cross the stars in the blink of an eye, how is it that we still have systems experiencing famine? The Rekohu Project is an effort to change that, and to find new ways to keep even the poorest fed. »

In support of this goal, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed an open order for various commodities, promising to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Kanai Enterprise in the Blido Piru system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering goods to the starport can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 19th of April 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Peace in Her Time: A Profile of Jasmina Halsey
Independent journalist Chukwuma Grant has published an article on peace activist and former Federal President Jasmina Halsey. Grant has described the report as a wide-ranging analysis that addresses « the political impact of a politician renouncing politics ».

Key extracts from the article are reprinted below:

« Some believe that Jasmina Halsey always intended to defect from the Federation and join the Alliance, where she currently acts as an advisor to Prime Minister Edmund Mahon. Others assert that after years of inhumane politics, her conscience broke through \u2013 that she sought meaning by helping others and striving for concord between the powers. »

« But it was Starship One's destruction that transformed Halsey \u2013 something that she herself could not possibly have planned. Her subsequent 'visions' made her politically toxic, at least as far as the Federation was concerned, allowing her to simply walk away from presidential life. In that escape pod, she escaped from more than an exploding ship \u2013 she escaped her previous self. »

« Critics argue that Halsey's extraordinary claims of encountering super-intelligent beings and seeing paradise are meaningless without evidence. And yet, in a cosmos containing Thargoids and Guardians, can they be easily dismissed? Or are her outlandish claims designed to cultivate a following among the disenfranchised and make her into a messianic figure? »

« If Halsey is walking a deliberate path, it remains an unstable one. Many in the Alliance have questioned why their leader is taking advice from a former psychiatric patient, let alone an ex-Federal President. Whether she is a visionary, a lunatic or a brilliant political manipulator remains to be seen. »


* Imperial Senator Murdered
Imperial Senator Nestor Cartesius has been found dead at his home on Capitol. Regional media streams have confirmed that his death is being treated as a homicide.

Captain Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service conveyed the facts at a press conference:

« The body of Senator Cartesius was discovered in the early hours of this morning. There were no signs of a struggle, but we did discover a note that we assume was deliberately placed there by the murderer. The note read: 'For Jameson'. »

« As is well known, last year the ship of historical figure Commander John Jameson was located, following his final mission on behalf of the now-defunct Intergalactic Naval Research Arm. Presumably, this is the Jameson to whom the note refers. »

« IISS analysts have confirmed that Nestor Cartesius was directly descended from a senior member of the INRA. We therefore believe that this crime is connected to the recent rediscovery of INRA outposts. Our working hypothesis is that the motive was revenge, driven by perceived misconduct on the part of both the INRA and Cartesius's ancestor. »

Captain Seutonia concluded by saying the investigation was ongoing.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval made a brief statement:

« The Empire has lost one of its staunchest champions \u2013 one whose name will never be forgotten. Rest assured that we will do everything in our power to find those responsible and bring them swiftly to justice. »

* Utopia Plans for Humanity's Extinction
An announcement from Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, has addressed the possibility that humanity may lose the conflict against the Thargoids.

« For many years, our Sim-Archive has bridged the past and the future by digitally preserving the memories of countless deceased individuals. Should there come a time when our physical selves no longer exist, it is the Sim-Archive alone that will preserve humankind's essence. »

« As such, in these volatile times, our priority is to ensure that the Sim-Archive survives humanity's potential extermination. We urge all galactic citizens to join Utopia and help the collective soul of our species live on. »

Commander Solveig Smith, who has fought the Thargoids in the Pleiades, commented:

« Antal makes it sound like we are about to be wiped out, which is far from the truth. Things are tough right now, but we're a long way off having to convert the whole human race into software! »

A more practical concern was raised by Marquis Felix Novantico, a retired military strategist for the Imperial Navy:

« Pranav Antal's pessimism notwithstanding, an increase in security for his Sim-Archive is logically sound. The data it contains makes it a valuable prize for our enemy. Should the Thargoids gain access to it, it could lead to a better understanding of human psychology, and allow them to anticipate our tactics more effectively. »


* The Biggest Party of 3304
The Vadimo Patrons of Law, an Imperial organisation based in Vadimo, has announced plans to host an elaborate soir\u00e9e in the Vadimo system.

A spokesperson for the organisation elaborated on the nature of the event:

« Let's be honest, things aren't great at the moment. We've got aggressive aliens on the doorstep and no one seems entirely sure what to do about it. So we thought \u2013 why not throw a big party? Give the people of Vadimo a chance to forget about their worries for a night. We want this to be the best party the system has ever seen. Or at least the best one of 3304. »

To ensure that the event is a success, Vadimo Patrons of Law has placed an open order for a range of commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Sikorsky Station. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to guarantee that those delivering commodities to Sikorsky Station can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 26th of April 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Senator's Death Raises Questions about INRA
The murder of Imperial Senator Nestor Cartesius has led to widespread public speculation, along with an increased interest in the activities of the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm.

Dr Oskar Kincaid, an Alliance historian, examined the backdrop to the case:

« The INRA has always been viewed with suspicion. Contemporaneous records suggest that it was involved in biochemical warfare against the Thargoids during their original incursion in the 3100s. There were even rumours of experimentation on live Thargoid subjects, but at the time many saw this as the only way to halt a superior hostile force. »

« Why this shadowy operation from one and a half centuries ago should now result in an Imperial senator's death is a matter of conjecture. But there are many documented cases of retroactive retribution, where one family \u2013 or its followers \u2013 seeks atonement from another. History's course is often diverted by the flow of bloodlines. »

Jast Fern\u00e1ndez, chief editor of an independent media outlet, made more candid observations:

« It's clear that the killer was motivated by the recent discovery of Commander Jameson's ship, and the logs that prove he was manipulated and sacrificed by the INRA. If one of Cartesius's great-grandparents was responsible, of course that would make him a target. And although it's hard to condone murder, it's also difficult not to see this as an ethically grey area. The INRA's betrayal of Jameson is a monstrous injustice that cries out for redemption. »

Imperial newsfeeds featured an appeal from Senator Pal Vespasian:

« The loss of my friend and colleague in the Senate is a terrible tragedy. I ask that Nestor's family be given space to grieve. »

Captain Niamh Seutonia, who is leading the IISS investigation, also released a brief statement:

« Assumptions regarding Senator Cartesius's death are unhelpful at this stage. We are currently pursuing forensic leads from the crime scene as well as undertaking background research. I will keep the public apprised of the facts. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, has addressed the possibility that humanity may lose the conflict against the Thargoids. In a public statement, he suggested that the Sim-Archive \u2013 a digital repository of human memories \u2013 could be the key to humanity's survival, should the Thargoids overwhelm the human race.

Meanwhile, the murder of Imperial Senator Nestor Cartesius has led to widespread public speculation. One commentator speculated that the killer was « motivated by the discovery of John Jameson's ship, and the logs that prove he was manipulated and sacrificed by the INRA ». A member of the Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that the organisation was pursuing forensic leads from the crime scene.

Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Kanai Enterprise and by eliminating agitators in Blido Piru, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Defending the Sim-Archive
The Utopia commune has launched a project to build a military installation in its home system to defend the Sim-Archive from potential Thargoid attack.

Dr Leigh Constantinides, a spokesperson for Utopia, made this announcement:

« Following recent observations by the respected strategist Marquis Novantico, we accept that the Sim-Archive requires increased protection to prevent its knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. Our partner organisation, the Narri Justice Party, is therefore overseeing the construction of a new security installation. We beseech the galactic community to support this worthy endeavour. »

Independent pilots are requested to deliver construction materials to Bobko City in the Narri system. To protect traders, the Narri Justice Party has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list operating in the system.

The campaign begins on the 3rd of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Vadimo Patrons of Law Campaign Concludes
The Vadimo Patrons of Law has announced that its campaign has received the unalloyed support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Sikorsky Station and by eliminating agitators in Vadimo, thereby protecting traders participating in the initiative. The delivered goods will be used to throw an elaborate party for the people of Vadimo.

The Vadimo Patrons of Law has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Sikorsky Station in the Vadimo system.


* Antal's Pessimism Triggers Backlash
Many key figures have contested Pranav Antal's suggestion that humanity could lose the conflict against the Thargoids.

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters commented:

« It's surprising to hear such a dystopian prediction from the leader of Utopia! I know Antal's heart is in the right place when he talks about preparing for the far future, but our focus should be on the present. The Thargoid threat has prompted an unprecedented level of inter-power cooperation, and this positive approach is what we must concentrate on. »

Admiral Aden Tanner made a statement on behalf of Aegis:

« Let me make this clear: our enemy may be powerful, but they are far from achieving victory. With our AX weaponry and new megaships, Aegis is leading an effective resistance against Thargoid forces. »

Further refutation came from Li Yong-Rui, CEO of the Sirius Corporation:

« With all due respect to Antal, his peculiar vision of humanity surviving as a mass of digital ghosts cannot be taken seriously. It's not as if civilisation is on the edge of collapse \u2013 for most of us it remains business as usual. Our survival instincts and ingenuity will keep our societies functioning for a long time to come. »


* Covert Organisation Discovered
The Imperial Internal Security Service has discovered that the murderer of Senator Nestor Cartesius was acting on behalf of a secret organisation.

Captain Niamh Seutonia, leading the IISS investigation into Cartesius's death, made this statement:

« We had determined Senator Cartesius was killed by a nerve toxin, and that whoever administered it was trained in circumventing security. Our leads pointed to an ex-member of the Imperial Guard now operating as a freelance assassin. We tracked her to her hideout, where she resisted arrest. Unfortunately, in the subsequent exchange of gunfire, we had no choice but to eliminate the assassin. »

« Examination of the killer's communication equipment confirmed that she was hired to kill Cartesius and deliver the 'For Jameson' message. Her employers identified themselves as the League of Reparation. It seems that the motive was indeed revenge \u2013 the League's avowed goal is to secure 'justice for the victims of the INRA's crimes'. »

« We are now widening our investigation and establishing a taskforce. The IISS will uncover this organisation and eradicate it before it can commit further atrocities. »

When asked if anyone connected to the INRA might be at risk, Captain Seutonia replied:

« That is a distinct possibility. If the League of Reparation is targeting the descendants of those involved in the INRA's activities, there are potentially thousands who may be targeted, and not just in the Empire. To that end I have already made contact with my counterparts in the Federation and the Alliance, and invited them to work with our taskforce. »

* Aegis Responds to Concern over Thargoid Incursions
There has been widespread disquiet over recent reports that Thargoid ships have been encountered in the core systems.

The level of anxiety is exemplified by political spokesperson Councillor Rasmus Tseng, who said:

« For months now, communities in the core systems have been living in a state of fear, wondering which will be the next to be targeted. The Thargoids have been striking at starports in the region one by one, and nobody is able to stop them! Why are the powers doing so little? Where are our defences, our fleets? Surely the core systems cannot be so vulnerable? »

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, directly addressed these concerns:

« Reports that the Thargoids are encroaching upon the core systems en masse are grossly overstated. Although they have crossed the threshold, all we have seen so far are localised incidents in fringe systems. This is not a full-scale invasion, and it does not warrant large fleet movements of the kind that have been suggested. »

« Rest assured: the enemy is contained. There is no need for panic. Courageous independent pilots, armed with Aegis technology, are doing a superb job at halting the Thargoids' progress. It's to be expected that we suffer occasional losses in this conflict, but these do not indicate an impending catastrophe. »


* New Prisoner Facilities in Veroklist
The Empire has announced plans to construct a new Riker-Class Prison Ship in the Veroklist system.

Once complete, the ship will house criminals who accepted a period of Imperial slavery in lieu of a jail sentence, but who have proved to be too dangerous or unstable for such corrective punishment.

The Moritasgus Imperial Corporation, which is overseeing the initiative, has placed an open order for Imperial slaves and non-lethal weapons, promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Vaucouleurs Vision in the Veroklist system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

Moritasgus Imperial Corporation spokesperson Superintendent Arnold Cochran released the following statement:

« We are pleased the Empire has awarded us this contract, and we look forward to the first ships arriving with our new guests. »

The campaign begins on the 10th May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Utopia Campaign Concludes
The Utopia campaign to construct a military installation in its home system has now concluded. Many traders delivered a huge quantity of construction material to Bobko City, which will be used to build defences for the Sim-Archive. Other independent pilots protected the operation by eliminating pirate vessels.

Utopia's spokesperson, Dr Leigh Constantinides, expressed her gratitude:

« On behalf of Utopia, I would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to support this project. We hope that this will safeguard the Sim-Archive for the benefit of all our descendants. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Bobko City in the Narri system.

* Alliance Admiral Murdered by League of Reparation
A member of the Council of Admirals, which commands the Alliance Defence Force, has been murdered. The League of Reparation has claimed responsibility.

Fleet Admiral Tulimaq Buchanan was travelling to a naval ceremony at Lave Station when his private vessel was attacked and destroyed. The admiral's personal staff and the ship's crew were also killed.

Moments later, the following message was transmitted to news feeds across the galaxy:

« We do not forget the crimes of the INRA. We do not forgive those who carry their guilt. For Jameson. »

Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride, a founding member of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League, delivered the following statement:

« We are treating this attack as an act of terrorism from the League of Reparation. Fleet Admiral Buchanan's family history verifies that one of his forebears was a senior commander in the INRA prior to settling down on Lave over a century ago. »

« We are working to identify the attackers, who somehow managed to avoid local security forces. There's evidence to suggest that the League's assassins are being aided by sympathetic individuals in positions of influence. Our investigation continues. »

The Alliance Assembly released a joint statement:

« This is a sickening and cowardly act of aggression that has cost us dearly. Such a brutal assault on our people and values cannot go unpunished. »

Commodore Riri McAllister spoke on behalf of the Alliance Defence Force:

« A replacement member for the Council of Admirals will soon be appointed. In the meantime, we are doing all we can to support the taskforce in tracking down these criminals. »

* Colonia Project Requests Microresources
Scientists in Colonia are investigating the region's potential to support larger populations in the future.

Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is leading the research, published this statement:

« Over the past few years the region's population has expanded ferociously, so it has become a priority to investigate how Colonia might support even greater numbers, and what kind of infrastructure would be required. »

« This research requires a range of specialised materials, for which we're prepared to pay handsomely. With these, we can evaluate Colonia's true potential. »

The campaign is being run by the Colonia Co-operative, one of Colonia's partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver microresources to Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.

The campaign begins on the 17th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Salvage and Rescue Operation
A convoy travelling through the core systems has come under attack from a pirate group, and local authorities are requesting assistance in finding survivors.

The operation is being coordinated by Security Chief Tal Wo\u017aniak of United Carnoeck for Equality, who made this announcement:

« The convoy came under intense fire from pirates, with many ships damaged or destroyed. We immediately dispatched search-and-rescue teams, but the volume of debris is significant, and we are therefore requesting help from any independent pilots in the area. »

« Our priority is to locate survivors, but we're also keen to acquire data that might help to bring those responsible to justice. »

Pilots are requested to recover Occupied Escape Pods, Black Boxes and Wreckage Components, and deliver them to Bacon City in the Carnoeck system.

The campaign begins on the 17th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Veroklist Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Moritasgus Imperial Corporation has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Vaucouleurs Vision, and by protecting traders in the Veroklist system.

Moritasgus Imperial Corporation spokesperson Superintendent Arnold Cochran released the following statement:

« We are pleased that the faith shown in us by the Empire has been rewarded. The expansion of facilities means we can now safely contain some of the worst criminals in the Empire. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vaucouleurs Vision in the Veroklist system.


* Fringe Doomsayer Cults on the Rise
An increasing number of religious movements in the core systems are proclaiming that humanity is on the verge of destruction.

Awareness of the issue has been raised by independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo, who published an article outlining the phenomenon:

« The return of the Thargoids has led to the emergence of dozens of radical groups. Although their nature varies, the message is the same: the apocalypse is coming. »

« Some of these groups are distinctly religious in flavour. The Church of the Eternal Void, for example, preaches that the war for human souls is almost lost. Their view of the Thargoids as 'demons from a hellish universe' and the Guardians as 'beings of light who have decreed us unworthy of salvation' runs along classic theological lines. »

« Others, such as Generation Omega, stoically accept that our time is almost over. They state that 'superior spacefaring lifeforms will naturally destroy inferior ones, just as our own cultures have overrun each other since prehistory'. Generation Omega plans to build mass euthanasia centres for planetary populations, declaring that the human era deserves to end in a dignified manner. »

« Of course there have always been 'doomsayers', and naturally our governments refuse to accept them as legitimate. But that hasn't stopped these organisations from attracting thousands of citizens and millions of credits, with their followers growing in number rapidly. »

« During wartime, many people become desperate for the certainty that such belief systems provide. We are likely to see these radical elements increase their influence as long as the shadow of the Thargoids falls over us. »

Authorities in the core systems responded to Okonkwo's article by restating that the Thargoid threat is being controlled and that such fearmongering is unwarranted.

* Federal Citizens Assassinated by the League of Reparation
Terrorist group the League of Reparation has committed three further murders in Federation space.

The body of Ezra Lux-Kumar, a wealthy entrepreneur, was found in his home on Biggs Colony yesterday. Local security forces confirmed that the cause was a lethal nerve toxin of the same type used in the murder of Imperial Senator Cartesius.

The Pilots Federation has also confirmed that two of its members have been killed, in the Rhea and Delta Pavonis systems. The Commanders' names have not been released, but the circumstances of their deaths are identical, involving a targeted strike on their ships with military-grade weapons. In both cases, the hulls of their vessels were laser-branded with the words 'FOR JAMESON'.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez of the Federal Intelligence Agency made this statement:

« This alarming development confirms that these terrorists are as well organised and widespread as we feared. We offer our sincere sympathies to the victims' families, all of whom have been transported to a secure location for their own protection. »

« We are collating data from all three sites and working closely with the tri-power taskforce investigating the League of Reparation. Genealogy databases are being consulted to identify potential targets with ancestry connected to the INRA, so that we might be more proactive in ensuring their safety. »


* Temporary Tax Freeze Announced
A galaxy-wide suspension of revenue tax has been announced. All three superpowers are supporting the freeze, which will see profit margins for everyday commodities increase.

The temporary alleviation will allow fiscal authorities to complete a much-needed evaluation of galactic taxation.

The news is expected to be warmly received by traders, who will earn more for their goods for the duration of the moratorium.

The galaxy's independent engineers, who constitute a vital part of the galactic economy, have agreed to support the freeze by offering their designs in exchange for more readily available materials.

The tax suspension will run from the 24th to the 30th of May 3304.


* Restoring Order in T'iensei
Authorities in the T'iensei system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.

To counter this threat, the Autocracy of T'iensei has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Dzhanibekov Port.

The campaign begins on 24th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Colonia Campaign Concludes
The campaign to supply a scientific project in Colonia has now concluded. Hundreds of independent pilots made the journey to deliver microresources to the Colonia Co-operative in the Coeus system.

Professor Alexei de la Vega, in charge of the research project, made this statement:

« These vital materials will allow us to establish a framework for how the region can expand. Thank you to everyone who has helped to chart a roadmap for Colonia's future. »

Pilots who contributed to the project can now collect their rewards from Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.


* Los Chupacabras Campaign
Los Chupacabras, an independent faction based in the LFT 926 system, has announced plans for a musical event known as the Jailhouse Rock and Blues Music Festival.

A spokesperson for the group issued the following statement:

« Our hope is that this will be the greatest music festival this side of Sagittarius A*. To quote Plato: 'Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything'. »

In support of the event, Los Chupacabras have placed an open order for quantities of beer, tobacco, coffee and narcotics, and have promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Meredith City in the LFT 926 system.

The campaign begins on the 24th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Salvage and Rescue Operation Ends
The operation to recover survivors and salvage from a convoy that was attacked in the core systems has been brought to a halt. Search-and-rescue teams from United Carnoeck for Equality were assisted by scores of independent pilots.

Security Chief Tal Wo\u017aniak thanked those who participated:

« Many of the convoy's crew members owe their lives to the Commanders who brought them to safety. We have also recovered data from the attack, which will help us track down and wipe out the pirate group responsible, hopefully before they massacre more innocents. »

Pilots who contributed to the operation can now collect their rewards from Bacon City in the Carnoeck system.


* Commodore McAllister Appointed to Council of Admirals
Commodore McAllister Appointed to Council of Admirals

Commodore Riri McAllister of the Alliance Defence Force has been appointed to the Council of Admirals and promoted to the position of Rear Admiral.

The Council of Admirals is responsible for military strategy for the entire Alliance, and each of its six members commands a contributing navy. A vacancy was created when Fleet Admiral Tulimaq Buchanan was assassinated by the League of Reparation.

McAllister, who hails from the Lave system and who is now in charge of its navy, is the youngest person ever to be appointed to the Council. She is also the most junior in rank, having bypassed several other candidates from the ADF admiralty, which has caused some controversy.

Admiral George Varma defended the appointment:

« Despite her relative youth, McAllister is one of our most decorated combat veterans and a master strategist. This makes her an excellent choice to help defend the Alliance. »

The newly promoted Rear Admiral McAllister made a characteristically brief statement:

« I'm grateful to the Council for this honour. As well as my naval duties, I will be aiding efforts against the terrorist group responsible for my predecessor's death. »


* The Courtship of Aisling Duval
A media broadcast has identified a number of potential romantic suitors for Princess Aisling Duval.

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios discussed the matter in a special edition of his programme:

« There's been a lot of discussion about Aisling Duval lately, with some viewing her as reaching a certain maturity in the political arena. But never mind that! What we want to know is: who is the galaxy's most eligible princess dating? »

« Let's face it, there must be no end of gentlemen focusing their sights on her. She's a Duval, the daughter of the late Emperor, and a woman of enormous charm, intelligence and culture. Plus \u2013 she's a stunner! »

« Three years ago it looked like Admiral Denton Patreus might be the one tying the knot. But we can assume that Aisling Duval spurned his advances, perhaps concluding \u2013 like many of us \u2013 that Patreus was more interested in the Imperial throne than anything else. So, who might be wooing the 'people's princess' now? »

« The first possibility is Senator Caspian Leopold, who has attended many meetings with Aisling and speaks warmly of her in interviews. Of course, the senator is almost twice her age, but he is undoubtedly a gifted orator, not to mention enormously wealthy and influential. And sometimes experience wins out! »

« On the other end of the scale is a young man called Jarl Toredo, who has been spotted visiting Aisling at the palace. This passionate firebrand runs an organisation called Universal Liberty, and has made a name for himself campaigning against Imperial slavery. So naturally, any relationship would give Aisling's own charity an enormous PR boost. »

« Toredo is a salt-of-the-earth type who has worked hard to build a life for himself. His background could not be more different from Aisling's, with both his parents having died in servitude. A romance seems unlikely\u2026but I wouldn't rule it out! »

« Potential suitor number three, Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, has been stationed on Aisling's home planet Emerald, where the two of them took a private tour around the Prism's Shades art installation. The tall and handsome ambassador cut a striking figure beside the princess, as the empathic art pulsed with light around them. A political gesture designed to soothe relations with the Federation, or something more personal? »

« One thing's for sure \u2013 Princess Duval walks her own path, and has no problem with upsetting the established order. So when it comes to her love life, all bets are off! »

And those are the main stories this week.


* Anarchy in Socho
The Socho system, headquarters of Aegis Core, has been overtaken by a criminal faction. The system is now in a state of anarchy.

A courier carrying a message from Aegis scientist Dr Mia Valencourt managed to escape the system. The message was then broadcast by the Rewired news service:

« This is an urgent call for assistance. Regional security forces have been overrun, and this vicious gang \u2013 they call themselves the Socho Gold Raiders \u2013 they're in charge now. They've shut everything down. Apparently they're convinced we're building some kind of super-weapon, so that's probably what brought them here. »

« They were so clever. We picked up what looked like a Thargoid signal and the security forces went charging in. Everyone was terrified that the Thargoids had come to Socho. But it wasn't the Thargoids \u2013 it was a trap. The Raiders were waiting, and they cut those ships to pieces. »

« Please, if anyone's listening, this is an emergency. It's absolute chaos here. Please help! »

Professor Alba Tesreau, Aegis's chief scientific advisor, made an emotional plea:

« It is inconceivable that elements of our own society would behave this way when there's so much at stake. There is vital research taking place at Aegis Core. If it's lost, these criminals will have placed all of us at risk! »

« I implore the galactic community to help free Socho from these unthinking vandals. Aegis is defending humanity against the Thargoid threat. We need your help to survive, so that we in turn can protect you and your families. »

* Campaign for Pleiades Starport Restoration
A fund has been set up by the Aegis Research to repair starports in the Pleiades Nebula that have been damaged during the Thargoid conflict.

Senior engineer Lilith Galloway made this announcement:

« We've had the worst of it here. The Thargoids have given us a bloody nose on several occasions. But we are strong, we will heal, and you can help. »

« We're asking for pilots to deliver as much as they can fit in their holds. We're going to rebuild our starports better than ever. Let's get the Pleiades fighting fit once more. »

Traders are requested to deliver construction materials to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.

The campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Order Restored in T'iensei
The Autocracy of T'iensei has announced that its campaign to clear the T'iensei system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Authorities in T'iensei have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dzhanibekov Port in the T'iensei system.


* Los Chupacabras Campaign Concludes
Los Chupacabras have announced that their plan to host a music festival in the LFT 926 system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Meredith City, the organisation's base of operations.

Los Chupacabras thanked those who supported the campaign, and confirmed that a second festival is already being planned.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Meredith City in the LFT 926 system.


* Starport Repair Initiative Announced
Following Thargoid strikes on the fringes of the core systems, a new initiative to restore damaged starports has been announced.

Chief administrator Carter Armstrong spoke on behalf of Aegis Core, which is coordinating the campaign:

« We've set up this fund to reassure citizens that normality will continue, no matter what. I would like to appeal to the galactic community to restore services in the core systems to their previously high standard. »

An open order has been placed for construction materials, which will be shipped to the affected starports and used to make repairs. Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.

The campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Aegis Hails Eagle Eye Success
Aegis has announced that its Eagle Eye initiative is proving to be a great success, and has helped to repel Thargoid forces from systems in the Pleiades Nebula.

The Eagle Eye orbital surveillance installations were established earlier this year to monitor transmissions from known Thargoid surface sites. This data is then made available to independent pilots.

In an interview with The Federal Times, Admiral Aden Tanner remarked:

« I have no doubt that without this surveillance data, more starports in the Pleiades would have been attacked and damaged. Only last week, Thargoid incursions in the Lwalama and Lalande 4141 systems were vigorously resisted thanks to the early warnings provided by Eagle Eye. »

« We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to those brave Commanders who have engaged the Thargoids in battle. Aegis was established to help protect the galaxy, and with the help of courageous members of the galactic community we will assuredly triumph. »


* Ships Destroyed by the League of Reparation
The Pilots Federation has reported that five independent ships have been attacked by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation, with the loss of all crewmembers.

No details have been released regarding specific names or locations, except that three of the ships were attacked in Alliance-controlled systems, one in a Federal system and one in Imperial space.

The Pilots Federation also confirmed that the message 'FOR JAMESON' had been etched by laser beam into drifting hull fragments from all five ships.

Captain Niamh Seutonia, a member of the tri-power taskforce investigating the League, released this statement:

« We are treating these incidents as terrorist actions by the League of Reparation, targeted against people with ancestral connections to the INRA. Analysts have been despatched to all five locations. »

« Meanwhile, we have determined that League agents receive their orders via multi-relayed, encrypted comms channels from a source using the codename 'Nexus'. This suggests a central point of coordination, rather than autonomous cells. Whether Nexus is an individual, a group, or a faction is not yet known. »

« We are aware that citizens throughout the Alliance, Empire and Federation are alarmed by these horrific attacks. We assure you that the taskforce is working hard to discover more about this group and eliminate it. In the meantime, we ask everyone to remain vigilant and to report any relevant information to local authorities. »

* Aisling Duval Hosts Federal Ambassador
Last weekend, Princess Aisling Duval hosted a diplomatic function at which Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester was the guest of honour.

Although security at the event was tight, entertainment journalist Solomon Helios managed to obtain an exclusive insight for his programme.

« If you're wondering what happened to your invitation to the Princess's soir\u00e9e, it probably ended up in the same black hole as mine. But I can still bring you a little peek from behind closed doors! »

« It's not unusual for the Imperial family to hold parties for visiting ambassadors. What is unusual is that on this occasion, Aisling invited all of Jordan Rochester's staff, including the captain and crew of his ship. Since the FNS Pioneer's commanding officer is none other than Vice Admiral Juno Rochester, one of Jordan's sisters, perhaps this was seen as an opportunity to meet a future in-law? »

« My contacts tell me that despite the variety of uniforms, hairstyles and accents, the night was full of enjoyment. Aisling and Jordan danced together before the ambassador formally thanked the princess on behalf of the Federation. »

« But that's not all. The next day, who should arrive at Emerald but Senator Caspian Leopold \u2013 who you'll remember is also rumoured to have romantic intentions toward the people's princess. Supposedly he's there on official business, although I understand there's nothing scheduled in his calendar. Or perhaps his invitation arrived late, like mine\u2026 »

« So is the princess courting, or merely holding court? As always, Aisling keeps us guessing! »


* Starport Repair Initiative Concludes
The campaign by Aegis Core to fund the refurbishment of starports in the core systems has now ended. A large quantity of construction materials were delivered to Dantec Enterprise.

Carter Armstrong, chief administrator for the project, announced his thanks:

« The galactic community has really pulled through for us. These materials will be put to good use in repairing the damage caused by Thargoid attacks. We'll soon have these starports restored and offering the high-quality services you'd expect. »

Pilots who made deliveries for this initiative can now collect their rewards from Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.


* Success for Pleiades Restoration Project
There has been a positive response to the campaign to fund repairs for starports in the Pleiades Nebula. Huge quantities of construction materials were received, which will be used to restore many of the stations damaged by the Thargoids.

Senior engineer Lilith Galloway made a statement on behalf of Aegis Research:

« We didn't expect so many of you to help. But that's the spirit here in the Pleiades \u2013 we come back stronger. Our thanks to everyone who supplied us with what we need. »

Pilots who contributed to this project can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.


* Conflict in Lave
The Lave Radio Network, an independent organisation based in the Lave system, has announced plans to broadcast its annual conference, which this year will take place in the Diso system from the 24th to the 25th of June.

To ensure they can share the event with the entire galaxy, the Lave Radio Network has placed an open order for various commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Lave Station in the Lave system.

But not everyone is enthusiastic about the event. The Lave Jet Family has responded with a rival campaign expressly designed to undermine the Lave Radio initiative, and has invited pilots to deliver commodities to help construct a signal jammer.

The two organisations have set out week-long operations to achieve their aims, which will begin on the 7th of June 3304.


* INRA Descendant Murdered
A descendant of Amaro Hem, one of the INRA's senior members, has been murdered by terrorist group the League of Reparation. His body was found in the wreckage of a crashed ship.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, part of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League, provided a full explanation at a press conference:

« We have identified the deceased as Luca Hem, an unemployed construction worker living at Houtman City in the Aeternitas system. He was reported missing by his family two weeks ago. We can confirm that he was the great-grandson of Amaro Hem, who was a programme coordinator with the INRA. »

« Luca Hem's body was found strapped into an ancient Cobra Mk III, the same model flown by Commander Jameson. Forensics indicate he was still alive when the ship struck an asteroid in the Aeternitas A Belt. The Cobra's derelict condition suggests it wasn't travelling under its own power, and was most likely salvaged from a scrapyard specifically for this purpose. »

« According to logs discovered at the Taylor Keep INRA facility, Amaro Hem was responsible for ensuring that Jameson did not return from his mission against the Thargoids. This staged murder, recreating the circumstances of Jameson's death, is obviously intended as an act of poetic justice by the League of Reparation. »

« Luca Hem's wife and children have been taken to secure locations for their own protection, as have nine individuals from other families related to Amaro Hem. »

Agent Ramirez concluded:

« It's clear that the League is using theatrical tactics to ensure its message reaches the media. Our taskforce is working hard to discover more about this organisation, and to bring these terrorists to justice. »


* Theft Baffles Security Experts
A valuable work of art has been stolen by a mysterious and highly skilled criminal.

The theft took place in the Garden City Gallery on Turner's World in the Alioth system. Sergeant Femi Abram of the municipal police discussed the incident:

« Our security specialists are currently at a loss to explain how this occurred. The piece in question was inside a titanium vault surrounded by plasma grids, proximity alarms and thermal sensors. This morning we found the vault door open and all security systems disabled. On the wall was a spray-painted graphic of what looked like a winking cat. »

The piece in question is a digital painting titled Youscape. This unusual cyber-artwork includes micro cameras linked to an AI node that monitor the viewer's reactions. Over time, the image alters in response to the owner's tastes.

The artwork was scheduled to be auctioned the following day. The artist, Barclay Uxor, told the media:

« Some lowlife scum has robbed the artistic community of a ground-breaking achievement \u2013 and cost me millions of credits, too. To leave common graffiti in its place is the ultimate insult! »

Garden City security forces are continuing to investigate, but as yet have no leads.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A descendant of Amaro Hem, one of the INRA's senior members, has been murdered by terrorist group the League of Reparation. The murder recreated the circumstances of Commander John Jameson's death, and has been interpreted as an act of poetic justice by the League of Reparation. Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez said that the League was using theatrical tactics to ensure its message reached the media.

In other news, Princess Aisling Duval met with not one but two of her suitors over the weekend \u2013 Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester and Senator Caspian Leopold. The former was invited to a function at the princess's palace on Emerald, while the latter made an unofficial visit the following day.

Meanwhile, the Lave Radio Network has announced plans to broadcast its annual conference from the Diso system. To ensure they can share the event with the entire galaxy, the Network has placed an open order for various commodities. But the Lave Jet Family has responded with a rival campaign designed to undermine the Lave Radio initiative, inviting pilots to liberate commodities from those supporting the Lave Radio campaign.

Two initiatives to restore starports damaged by the Thargoids have reached successful conclusions. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaigns by delivering construction materials to Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system and to The Oracle in the Pleiades.

Finally, a valuable work of art has been stolen by a mysterious and highly skilled criminal. A spray-painted graphic of what looked like a winking cat was discovered at the scene of the crime, which took place in the Garden City Gallery on Turner's World in the Alioth system. Garden City security forces are investigating, but as yet have no leads.

And those are the main stories this week.

* Lave Jet Family Campaign Concludes
The Lave Jet Family has announced that its campaign to prevent the Lave Radio Network from broadcasting its annual conference has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to construct a signal jammer, thereby preventing Lave Radio from transmitting the conference.

The Lave Jet Family has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lave Station in the Lave system.


* Lave Radio Network Campaign Concludes
The Lave Radio Network has announced that its campaign has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lave Station, thereby allowing the network to broadcast its annual conference to the entire galaxy. A rival campaign from the Lave Jet Family was unable to destabilise the Lave Radio initiative, despite also receiving the support of independent pilots.

As the campaign drew to a close, one of the organisers released a statement:

« The signal is spreading. We would like to extend our gratitude to the galactic community for making this possible. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lave Station in the Lave system.


* Anti-Slavery Organisations Unite
Princess Aisling Duval's anti-slavery campaign has merged with independent charity Universal Liberty. The rebranded organisation is named Unchain.

The former head of Universal Liberty, Jarl Toredo, made an announcement to the media:

« There's no shortage of poverty and suffering within the Empire, however much some may try to hide it. Few have the courage to face the truth, but Princess Duval has been an inspiration. So I'm very pleased that we're joining forces with her campaign to end slavery. »

« I was born into slavery. My parents were still slaves when they died. It is for them, and for all human beings treated as less than human, that we demand legal slavery be abolished. I'm proud to be part of Unchain, which will spread our message across the Empire. »

When asked about rumours linking him romantically with Aisling Duval, Toredo said only:

« I suspect Her Highness's attention is focused elsewhere. »


* League of Reparation Implicated in Historic Deaths
A recent report suggests that terrorist organisation the League of Reparation may be responsible for many more deaths than previously suspected.

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse shared his theories on the Rewired newsfeed:

« We know these League guys are wiping out people whose grandfolks used to work for the INRA, and it seems like things started when they poisoned that Imperial senator. But what if that wasn't their first murder, merely the first time they claimed responsibility? What if they've been active for years and nobody noticed? »

« I've been digging through old records of unsolved homicides. There's a dozen in the Federation alone where the cause of death was some kind of 'nerve agent' \u2013 just like with the senator and a few others. Not all the victims were identified, but I found four who definitely had the INRA in their past. These people didn't die recently but between one and five years ago. Coincidence? »

« The League also likes to blast its targets out of the sky. Think of all those unexplained shipwrecks found drifting in space over the years. How many were because one of the crew had some long-forgotten INRA connection? Dozens\u2026hundreds? How long has the League been hiding among us, silently taking out ordinary people? And who's next? »

Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride of Alliance Interpol responded on behalf of the united taskforce investigating the League:

« We cannot verify that these cold cases have any link with the League of Reparation. We'd also like to caution against this kind of baseless conjecture, which only serves to spread confusion. We are still pursuing more concrete leads, and hope to make a breakthrough very soon. »


* Refugee Centre Initiative
Due to heightened military action in the core systems, Senator Caspian Leopold has launched an initiative to construct a rehabilitation centre for those affected by the ongoing conflict.

A spokesperson for Senator Leopold gave the following statement to the media:

« An escalation in hostilities from both Thargoid and human parties has left a lot of innocent civilians without food or shelter. Senator Leopold has heard their cries for help, and is building a sanctuary where the safety of refugees can be guaranteed. »

The Nifelhel Corp., which is overseeing the initiative, has placed an open order for Cobalt, Semiconductors and Synthetic Fabrics, promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Biruni Port in the Niflhel system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the initiative can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 14th of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Lori Jameson Denounces Terrorist Organisation
The engineer Lori Jameson has made a public statement regarding the League of Reparation. The terrorist group claims to be seeking justice for the betrayal of her ancestor, the legendary pilot Commander John Jameson.

Her message was recorded at Jameson Memorial and broadcast by several media networks:

« There's been a lot of speculation about what connection I might have with the so-called League of Reparation, which has murdered a number of people in recent weeks. The answer is none whatsoever. Like all of you, I am sickened by this bizarre form of genealogical terrorism. »

« I'm not prepared to discuss my family in a public forum, but I want everyone to know that I am personally appalled by this, and am doing everything I can to help the authorities. »

« I'm sure that Nexus \u2013 whoever or whatever it might be \u2013 is listening to this message. So to them I say: stop. These acts of revenge for my great-grandfather are misguided, unnecessary and evil. If you really want to honour his name, you'll allow us to live in peace without fear. »

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, a member of the tri-power taskforce dedicated to stopping the League, added:

« I can confirm that Lori Jameson is cooperating with our investigation. We are completely satisfied that she, her family and her associates are entirely unconnected to the League of Reparation. We hope that her message convinces Nexus to see sense and stop this pointless violence. »


* Worshipping the Thargoids
A fringe religion that worships the Thargoids has come under the spotlight in a new academic article.

The author, Dr Alfred Ulyanov, is a leading expert in exotheology. He summarised his work for the media:

« A recent report by Gethin Okonkwo highlighted the emergence of doomsayer cults in response to the return of the Thargoids. But few are as strange as my current object of study \u2013 an organisation that considers the Thargoids to be not merely alien, but divine. »

« This mysterious sect doesn't have a formal name. The central tenet of its faith is that the Thargoids we have encountered so far are messengers \u2013 dark angels sent to prepare us for the true sacred presence, which will soon enter our plane of existence from another universe. They refer to this as the Far God. »

« As with many monotheistic belief structures, this cult considers the Far God to be unknowable and omnipotent, but also apocalyptic. Only true believers such as themselves will survive its manifestation. »

« Visiting one of the cult's hive-chapels is an unsettling experience. Aside from a few pulsing green lights they are very dark, and most surfaces are covered in a black coral-like substance. The congregation's prayers are directed toward an altar resembling the starfish shape of Thargoid vessels, almost like an octagonal crucifix. It's impossible to ignore that the entire place reeks of ammonia. »

« Cult members tend to wear simple hooded robes with no markings. They are intense and resolute, but many look unhealthy. It seems that this lifestyle attracts those on the very edge of society, whose low self-esteem leaves them vulnerable to beliefs that erode their identity. »

« As an exotheologian, I am of course fascinated by the sociological impact of non-human influences. But even for a scientist, it is difficult not to feel pity, and perhaps a little revulsion, for those who identify more with a hostile species than with their own people. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Princess Aisling Duval's anti-slavery campaign has merged with independent charity Universal Liberty. The rebranded organisation is named Unchain. The former head of Universal Liberty, Jarl Toredo, expressed his delight at the union, while rebuffing questions about his rumoured romantic attachment to Aisling Duval.

Lori Jameson has made a public statement regarding the League of Reparation, which claims to be seeking justice for her ancestor, Commander John Jameson. She denied any connection to the organisation while describing its actions as « misguided, unnecessary and evil ».

Meanwhile, an independent journalist has suggested that the League of Reparation may be responsible for many more deaths than previously suspected, drawing a link between the terrorist organisation and various unsolved homicides. Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride of Alliance Interpol denied that the cold cases had any connection to the League of Reparation.

A new academic article has drawn attention to a fringe religion that worships the Thargoids. The sect, which has no formal name, believes that the Thargoids are heralds of an omnipotent entity called the Far God. Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading expert in exotheology, has published an extensive commentary on the sect.

In other news, Senator Caspian Leopold has launched an initiative to construct a rehabilitation centre for those affected by heightened military action in the core systems. A spokesperson for Senator Leopold said: « An escalation in hostilities from both Thargoid and human parties has left a lot of innocent civilians without food or shelter. Senator Leopold has heard their cries for help, and is building a sanctuary where the safety of refugees can be guaranteed. »

Finally, the competing campaigns from the Lave Radio Network and the Lave Jet Family have come to an end. Both factions received support from independent pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately there could be only one victor.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Starport Status Update
This report presents the latest data on starports experiencing technical issues as a result of Thargoid Sensor related interference.

The following starports are on the brink of closure:

Swift Vision, Lu Pao

Klimuk Station, LHS 336

Guth Dock, Azrael

Charlois Enterprise, T'ien

Hughes Port, Gadjali

Stabenow Survey, Cerno

Kube-McDowell Enterprise, Kakas


* Investor Funds Colonia Shipyards
Renowned billionaire Zachary Rackham, owner of Rackham Capital Investments, has made a sizeable charitable donation to build new shipyards in the Colonia region.

Mr Rackham, known in some circles as 'Calico Zack', made this statement:

« If there's one thing I remember from flying around the galaxy in a second-hand Sidewinder with a leaky life-support module and only fifty credits in my pocket, it's the thrill of exploration. And Colonia is the embodiment of that spirit, the farthest-flung outpost of civilisation. »

« That's why I want to support it by funding the development of new shipyards. Every planetary port in the region, bar Colonia Hub, will soon be able to offer pilots the support services they need. It's my way of celebrating a youth filled with poverty and danger, by giving a boost to the next generation of explorers. »

Bryanna Blanco, a financial journalist for The Federal Times, also published a statement:

« Obviously this is tremendous news for Colonia and all those operating within the region. The timing of Rackham's donation is curious, however, coming as it does shortly before a company-wide audit. Having such a colossal sum placed beyond the reach of tax officials will certainly help that old pirate \u2013 and his crew of accountants \u2013 sleep better at night. »


* League of Reparation Agents Apprehended
A homicide attempt by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation has been foiled, and the would-be killers taken into custody.

The arrests were made by Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride of Alliance Interpol, who is part of the united taskforce investigating the League. She released this statement:

« I am pleased to confirm that the latest assassination attempt by the League of Reparation has been prevented, and that we have apprehended several of the group's members. »

« The operation involved revealing the location of one Dinah Law, a descendant of INRA employee Trystan Law. We anticipated that the League would follow its modus operandi and attempt to eliminate Ms Law, so with her cooperation we placed taskforce agents at her home. Fortunately, there were able to overpower the terrorists. »

« The captives have been transported to a secure Interpol facility for interrogation. Our primary aim is to establish the identity of Nexus \u2013 the entity that provides the organisation's members with their instructions. I have already conducted preliminary questioning of the prisoners and have acquired some significant facts. »

« I'm confident that this is the beginning of the end for the League of Reparation, and that the taskforce's efforts will soon pay off. »


* Refugee Initiative Complete
Senator Caspian Leopold has announced that his appeal for commodities, in association with Niflhel Corp, has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Biruni Port, and by protecting traders in the Niflhel system.

A spokesperson for Senator Leopold made the following statement:

« Thanks to the work of many brave pilots, we can now begin construction of a rehabilitation centre that will keep innocent families safe from the ravages of war. Senator Leopold hopes that this is just the beginning, and that through further acts of philanthropy he might help spread peace throughout the galaxy. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Biruni Port in the Niflhel system.


* Aegis Installation Campaign
Aegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.

An Aegis spokesperson gave the following statement to the media:

« After the recent occupation of Socho by a hostile criminal element, it is imperative that Aegis bolster its holdings in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The construction of a military installation will allow us to continue our fight against the Thargoids unhindered by external forces. »

Aegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources, promising to reward pilots who deliver these to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 21st of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Starports Recover from Thargoid Strikes
Three starports attacked and damaged by Thargoid forces have now been restored to full functionality.

Carter Armstrong, chief administrator with Aegis Core, told the press:

« When we requested help to repair Thargoid-hit starports, we hoped the galactic community would be generous, but they exceeded our expectations. A colossal influx of materials has enabled us to repair two stations in the core systems in record time. »

« I'm pleased to announce that Armstrong Enterprise in the Bhal system and Beaufoy Vision in the Nauni system are now open for business. Keeping these starports operable allows us to honour those who lost their lives in the Thargoid attacks. Enormous thanks to everyone who participated. »

Senior Engineer Lilith Galloway of Aegis Research, who coordinated a parallel project, released a similar statement:

« Here in the Pleiades, survival is never guaranteed. But Reed's Rest in Merope has endured, thanks to the galactic community's incredible support. This is what we do when things get tough \u2013 we rebuild and come back stronger. »

All three starports are now fully operational and providing a range of services.


* Thargoids Repelled from Core Systems
Aegis has confirmed that the Thargoid presence in the core systems has been significantly diminished, due largely to the efforts of the galactic community.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis, made this statement:

« This is a very positive development. Using data from our Eagle Eye network, courageous members of the galactic community have formed a barrier of steel and fire, preventing Thargoid vessels from encroaching further. In doing so they have prevented several starports from being attacked, saving many thousands of lives. »

« Furthermore, in many regions the Thargoid incursion has actually been reversed. Although they remain entrenched within the Pleiades, their forces in the core systems have been pushed back to the Bhal system, their initial beachhead. »

« Aegis offers its sincere thanks and congratulations to every one of the Commanders who risked their lives by meeting our enemy in battle. These audacious pilots have proved that humanity's spirit is far from broken. Victory against the Thargoids will be hard-won, but I am in no doubt that with defenders of this calibre, it will one day be achieved. »


* Aisling Duval Announces Marriage to Federal Ambassador
Princess Aisling Duval has made an unexpected announcement regarding her relationship with Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester.

At a press conference in her palace on Emerald, the princess looked radiant as she addressed the media:

« It's no secret that Jordan and I grew close during his official visit. The time has come to let you know that we are to be husband and wife. »

« I'm aware that some will see this as unorthodox, even controversial, but love knows no borders. It's our wish that our marriage will build lasting bridges between the Empire and the Federation. »

A statement from Ambassador Rochester appeared in a special edition of The Federal Times:

« Representing the Federation has been my life's work, but meeting Her Highness \u2013 Aisling \u2013 made me realise that being by her side means even more. We hope that our betrothal will usher in a new era of cooperation between the two superpowers. »

Among the media reactions was this from entertainment journalist Solomon Helios:

« I've been reporting on Princess Duval's romantic life for a while now, and even I didn't see this coming. Can Aisling really pull this off? Could a Federation gentleman actually marry into the Imperial family? Will Emperor Lavigny-Duval and President Hudson share a dance at the wedding, or will they step in to prevent this union from taking place? The galaxy might never be the same again! »

As yet there has been no official comment from the Imperial Palace or the White House.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Aegis has confirmed that the Thargoid presence in the core systems has been significantly diminished, due largely to the efforts of the galactic community. Although the Thargoids remain entrenched in the Pleiades, their forces in the core systems have been pushed back to the Bhal system, their initial beachhead.

In related news, Aegis has confirmed that three starports attacked and damaged by Thargoid forces have now been restored to full functionality, following supportive efforts from the galactic community. The pertinent starports are Armstrong Enterprise in the Bhal system, Beaufoy Vision in the Nauni system and Reed's Rest in the Merope system.

In other news, Princess Aisling Duval has announced that she is to wed Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester. Both Princess Duval and Mr Rochester expressed hope that their marriage would strengthen ties between the Empire and the Federation. There has been no official comment from the Imperial Palace or the White House on the engagement.

A homicide attempt by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation has been foiled, and the would-be killers taken into custody. Kay Kilbride of Alliance Interpol confirmed that the captives had been transported to a secure facility for interrogation, with a view to establishing the identity of Nexus \u2013 the League's apparent coordinator.

Meanwhile, renowned billionaire Zachary Rackham, owner of Rackham Capital Investments, has made a sizeable charitable donation to build new shipyards in the Colonia region. Every planetary port in the region, bar Colonia Hub, will soon be able to offer pilots a full range of services.

Aegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the Pleiades. An Aegis spokesperson confirmed that the development was a response to the recent occupation of the Socho system \u2013headquarters of Aegis Core \u2013 by a hostile criminal element. Aegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources for use in the construction.

Finally, Senator Caspian Leopold has announced that his appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. The materials will be used to build a rehabilitation centre for those affected by war.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Alliance Inspector Killed by the League of Reparation
Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride has been murdered by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation, along with four other agents of Alliance Interpol.

The incident took place in the city of New Rossyth on Turner's World. A spokesperson for Interpol released a brief report:

« Chief Inspector Kilbride was acting on information that a League cell was operating from an abandoned foundry complex in New Rossyth. She led an assault team with the intention of capturing the terrorists. Preliminary forensics suggest that the entire complex was rigged with concealed explosives. Kilbride and four of her colleagues were killed instantly, with seven others injured. »

Kilbride was one of three founding members of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League of Reparation. The other two, Captain Niamh Seutonia and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, made a rare joint statement on behalf of the Imperial Internal Security Service and the Federal Intelligence Agency:

« This is a sad day. We have lost one of our greatest champions in the fight against terrorism. It's clear that the Chief Inspector was personally targeted with misinformation designed to lure her into a trap \u2013 an act of retaliation for her recent successes against the League. »

« Although we mourn the loss of Inspector Kilbride, our work continues. Alliance Interpol has assigned Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt to assume the role of taskforce liaison. We look forward to working with her to eliminate this fanatical organisation. »

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.


* Galaxy Reacts to Federal-Imperial Betrothal
There has been a range of reactions to news that Princess Aisling Duval and Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester are to be married.

A congratulatory message was sent from the Imperial Palace, but there has been no personal comment from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. News agencies on Capitol have reported rumours that the proposed marriage was not discussed with the Imperial family, and that the Emperor did not consent to the Princess's engagement.

Senator Zemina Torval offered a more definite statement of disapproval:

« This is an attention-seeking move from the princess, and a dangerous one. It is beyond her remit to impact Imperial policy in this manner. Allowing her to harbour romantic fantasies is one thing, but the Empire cannot countenance such a reckless political manoeuvre. »

Senator Caspian Leopold, who until recently was rumoured to be courting Aisling Duval, was more supportive:

« I can assure you that many senators, patrons and citizens are delighted by the news. I've been privileged to witness Princess Aisling in Ambassador Rochester's company, and they make a charming and affectionate couple. I wish them both all the happiness in the galaxy. »

There was no response from President Zachary Hudson, suggesting that the engagement was as unexpected to the Federation as to the Empire. But a statement was made by Congressman Isolde Rochester, the mother of Jordan Rochester:

« I support my son's relationship with Her Imperial Highness, and I consider this a positive step for all parties. The potential benefits of stronger ties between the Empire and the Federation are incalculable, particularly in the areas of trade and defence. Many of us in Congress hope that this happy event spearheads a new era of cooperation. »

Reactions from independent systems have ranged from joy to outrage. The only official response from the Alliance came from a spokesperson for the office of Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, who said:

« The Alliance offers cordial congratulations to the couple, although it remains to be seen if their intentions become a reality. »

* Colonia Scientific Installation Project
Scientists in Colonia have announced plans to build a scientific outpost in the system to monitor the region's population and resources.

Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is heading the project, published this statement:

« Our recent study into the region's population increase has revealed alarming statistics. If Colonia's population continues to increase at the current rate it could lead to a serious depletion of resources at some point in the future. »

« Monitoring infrastructure, terraforming, logistics and other issues will require the construction of a dedicated centre for resource management. This will allow us to study the aggregated data and formulate a structured solution to avoid potential problems. »

The campaign is being run by Tir Technology Services, one of Colonia's partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver commodities to Bolden's Enterprise in the Tir system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Aegis Installation Operation Complete
The operation to support construction of an Aegis military facility in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering mined resources to The Oracle, and by protecting traders in the system.

An Aegis spokesperson made the following statement:

« Every pilot who contributed to this operation should feel a great deal of pride in what they've achieved. The construction of this military installation will allow us to more effectively resist external aggression. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.


* Restoring Order in Fousang
Security forces in the Fousang system are reporting that criminal organisations in the area are executing more frequent and audacious raids on civilian traffic.

Wing Commander Horatio Montange of Fousang security had this to say:

« Our resources are stretched with the Thargoid threat, and a certain criminal element has taken advantage, increasing their presence in the system and attacking trade convoys. While our forces are continuing to maintain order, the need to defend the system from external threats has had an impact on our overall effectiveness. With the help of Blue Creative Company we hope to curb this sudden increase in crime, and continue to concentrate our resources on combating the alien insurrection. »

To counter this threat, the Blue Creative Company has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Akers Orbital.

The campaign begins on the 28th of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Thargoid Assault on the Deciat System
An emergency report from Aegis confirms that the Thargoids have returned to the core systems with an incursion into the Deciat system.

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, delivered this statement:

« Following the Thargoids' retreat, all evidence suggested that their surface sites had become dormant. But new data from our Eagle Eye network shows that they have surged back to life, and that the star maps inside these structures are now pinpointing the Deciat system. It seems this was only a brief respite while they summoned reinforcements from the Pleiades. »

« Latest intelligence indicates that Thargoid vessels are now congregating in large numbers in Deciat space. This is an alarming development for the Garay Terminal starport, which is on high alert. There are also several megaships active in the region, which are potential targets for the Thargoids. »

« On behalf of Aegis, I am calling on all members of the galactic community for assistance in defending Deciat. Without the aid of independent pilots, all assets in the system could be overwhelmed, with the loss of thousands of lives. »

Appended to the Aegis report was the following transmission from an unnamed Commander operating in the Deciat system:

« I've just been attacked by\u2026something! Thargoid for sure, but my computer couldn't identify it. Some new kind of scout, maybe? »

The remainder of the transmission was unavailable.


* Aegis Reduces Tech-Broker Requirements
Aegis has announced that it will allow technology brokers to reduce their requirements for producing items, in order to increase overall combat effectiveness against the Thargoids.

Henrik de Lacerda, a senior engineer at Aegis Research, clarified this development:

« Aegis is aware that the galactic community has worked incredibly hard to oppose the Thargoids in the core systems. To show our appreciation, we are making it easier for independent pilots to obtain advanced weaponry and hardware. »

« We have contacted all registered technology brokers and supplied them with additional funding, resources and manufacturing equipment. As a result, they now need fewer commodities and materials from those purchasing their designs. »

« Our hope is that by helping pilots to upgrade their ships, we can enhance their survivability and encourage more Commanders to join the fight against the Thargoids. »


* Thargoid-Worshipping Cult Garners Hostility
Public reaction to a fringe religion that worships the Thargoids is one of mistrust and hostility, according to security reports.

The nameless cult believes in the coming of the so-called Far God and the subsequent extinction of all humanity bar themselves. Their hive-chapels, inspired by Thargoid design, have sprung up on several independent worlds and in a few Federation and Alliance systems.

Security forces in these locations have made numerous arrests for misdemeanours directed at the sect. These include graffiti, property damage, verbal abuse and physical assault. There are no recorded cases of worshippers retaliating, defending themselves or seeking assistance.

Juanita Bishop, who runs a vocal citizen-protection campaign, claims she is warning the public about a genuine danger:

« If these Thargoid lovers don't want to be human anymore, they shouldn't be allowed to live among other humans! Our governments should pack these foul-smelling freaks into ships and send them off to join the aliens they love so much. And if they don't, it's up to us to stop them. Do you really want these degenerates to creep into your home at night and do obscene alien things to your family? »

Many authorities have responded along the same lines as Councillor Quinn Damico of the Aranbarahun system:

« I would like to assure citizens that the Far God worshippers, while strange, are essentially harmless. Furthermore, criminal acts against them, including incitement to violence, may result in prosecution. The right to freedom of religion is protected by law in all systems where the sect has a presence. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride has been murdered by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation. The incident took place in the city of New Rossyth on Turner's World. In the wake of Inspector Kilbride's death, Alliance Interpol has assigned Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt to assume the role of taskforce liaison.

There has been a range of reactions to news that Princess Aisling Duval and Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester are to marry. A congratulatory message was sent from the Imperial Palace, but there was no comment from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. Senator Zemina Torval was frank in her disapproval, while Senator Caspian Leopold, who was rumoured to be courting Aisling Duval, was more supportive.

Aegis has announced that it will allow technology brokers to reduce their requirements for items, in order to increase overall combat effectiveness against the Thargoids. A spokesperson for Aegis said the galactic community had worked hard to oppose the Thargoids, and that Aegis would therefore make it easier for independent pilots to obtain advanced weaponry and hardware.

Meanwhile, an emergency report from Aegis has confirmed that the Thargoids have launched a large-scale assault on the Deciat system. The organisation has called on all members of the galactic community for assistance in defending the system, which is home to the Garay Terminal starport.

A fringe religion that worships the Thargoids has become the target of hostility, with large numbers of civilian protestors reacting angrily to the sect's openly pro-Thargoid stance. Authorities have responded with assurances that the sect's members are harmless, and that criminal acts against them may result in prosecution.

In other news, scientists in Colonia have announced plans to build an outpost to monitor the region's population and resources. Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is heading the project, said the proposed outpost would focus on ensuring that the ever-expanding region would have sufficient resources in the long term.

Finally, an operation to support construction of an Aegis military facility in the Pleiades Nebula has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering mined resources to The Oracle, and by protecting traders in the system.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Author Begins Interstellar Book Tour
Celebrated author Olav Redcourt has begun a promotional tour, visiting over fifty destinations throughout the core systems.

His new novel, 'Corsair King and the Storm of Desire', is the fourteenth in a series of swashbuckling historical romances set in the 27th century. A press release from Bonespire Publishing stated:

« After many months of waiting, the next book in Olav Redcourt's pulse-pounding series is at last on sale. To mark the occasion, we have organised an epic tour so that loyal readers can meet the creator of the Corsair King, Lady Lastday, Roughkiss and all their other favourite characters. The tour will begin in the Blatrimpe system and conclude two months later in Procyon. »

« As with all releases from Bonespire Publishing, readers will be able to customise the holo-novel to enhance their reading pleasure. Our easy-to-use controls allow the reader to revise narrative structure, vocabulary and characterisation, and the plotline will have multiple option points, enabling you to determine an ending that meets your tastes. »

An independent reporter approached Mr Redcourt as he was boarding a passenger liner, but was only able to record a few short statements. These included « bounced across space like a damn human pinball » and « nothing but meat for the sausage factory ».

The author's agent, Margaux Hist, told the media:

« I wouldn't pay much attention to that. Olav was probably just thinking aloud while developing a new character. »


* The Didiomanja Emperor's Grace Academy Inauguration
The Didiomanja Emperor's Grace has completed work on the Tiverion Academy, a flight school for Imperial naval cadets. The organisation is hosting an inaugural banquet to mark the event, and to honour the late Admiral Mira Tiverion, the organisation's founding member, who will have a monument erected at the site.

A spokesperson for the Didiomanja Emperor's Grace released the following statement:

« The Tiverion Academy will provide new recruits with cutting-edge training facilities. To host a fitting banquet for its inauguration, we require help in sourcing a range of exotic food and drink. We also require a quantity of gold to make the monument raised in the Admiral's memory a truly spectacular tribute. »

The campaign begins on the 5th of July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Colonia Campaign Concludes
The campaign to supply a scientific project in Colonia has now concluded and construction of a resource management centre has begun. Hundreds of independent pilots made the journey to deliver commodities to Tir Technology Services in the Tir system.

Professor Alexei de la Vega, in charge of the research project, made this statement:

« With the construction of a research centre we will be able to monitor population spikes and manage resource allocation throughout the region. »

Pilots who contributed to the project can now collect their rewards from Bolden's Enterprise in the Tir system.


* Starport Status Update

* A Thargoid Fifth Column?
Amid growing public mistrust of a fringe sect that worships the Thargoids, a report suggests that the group's members may be undercover Thargoid agents.

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse shared his theories via the Rewired news feed:

« I'm sure you're all just as creeped out as I am by those hooded monks and their stinking hive-chapels. Granted, being creepy isn't a crime, and I'm as live-and-let-live as the next man. But isn't it strange that this cult is rising just as the Thargoids return in force? »

« The idea of humans working on behalf of aliens might sound crazy, but think about it. All those escape pods captured by Thargoid ships\u2026what did they want them for? After a bit of brainwashing, they'd make perfect spies, sent back to infiltrate humanity using this religion as a cover. »

« What scares me is that these freaks don't communicate. They just lurk in the dark, waiting. Why are they so mysterious? What's going on in those chapels? For all we know, they're seeding our planets with barnacles and eggs, right under our noses. »

Leading exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov responded with this comment:

« I can categorically answer one point: the reason the Far God worshippers are not interested in communicating is that, from their point of view, we will all be dead soon. As for the rest of this speculation, nothing in my studies has caused me to suspect this group to be a threat, despite its unsettling beliefs. »


* Major Victories against the League of Reparation
A series of successful operations against the League of Reparation has led to much of the terrorist group being dismantled.

Captain Niamh Seutonia, a member of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League, released this statement:

« Over the last few days, Senior Agent Ramirez and I have led multiple raids against the League of Reparation. We interdicted several of their ships and located many outposts concealed within Imperial and Federal systems. The key to these victories was the decryption of their communications network. »

« Despite meeting fierce resistance, our security forces arrested or eliminated dozens of League members. In some cases, we acted just in time to prevent further murderous acts against those descended from members of the INRA. »

« We believe the League has been dealt a fatal blow, but we are still investigating how they gained access to top-level comms encryption and other restricted equipment, which suggests support from influential individuals. Furthermore, we have yet to identify Nexus, the organisation's coordinator. We have many fresh leads, however, and expect further results soon. »

Milo Vesper, an editor for The Alliance Tribune, published this opinion piece:

« This may be great news for some, but what about our citizens? The taskforce should be hunting down these animals in the Alliance! We know they're here, what with Admiral Buchanan at Lave and the trap they set for Chief Inspector Kilbride, whose bravery we will never forget. Why isn't her replacement out there on raids too? »

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.


* A Profile of Jordan Rochester
Responding to public interest in Princess Aisling Duval's fianc\u00e9, Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, political journalist Cassia Carvalho has compiled a profile for The Imperial Herald:

« Jordan Rochester is now a household name throughout the Empire, though few were aware of him prior to his engagement to Princess Duval. But in the Federation, the Rochesters have been associated with success for over two hundred years. »

« The Rochester name can be traced back to self-made tycoon Apollo Rochester, who was the biggest landowner on Biggs Colony in the Altair system. Each generation since has strived for fame and wealth, and the expression 'as rich as a Rochester' has become common parlance. »

« The family matriarch is Isolde Rochester. She is a member of Congress, an influential figure in the Liberal Party and a staunch supporter of Shadow President Felicia Winters. Isolde raised five children, including Jordan, and it was her accomplishments that inspired her son to enter politics. »

« Jordan's siblings chose different paths. The eldest, Jupiter Rochester, is an executive with Core Dynamics, with a personal fortune in the billions. Fifteen years ago he had his own celebrity marriage, to actor Tomas Turai. They now have two teenage children, daughter Kali and son Kalen. »

« Jordan's sisters, Juno and Jocasta, have impressive Navy careers, holding the ranks of Vice Admiral and Post Captain respectively. Only Jordan's younger brother, Jonah, has no title. He is believed to be the black sheep of the family. »

« Despite being just 34, Jordan has already made his mark. He has overseen several high-level negotiations on behalf of the Federal Diplomatic Corps and is now a trusted envoy, noted for his charm and tact. »

« His future will be interesting, to say the least. How will he balance being both a Federal statesman and an Imperial consort? And what are the wider ramifications of the Rochester dynasty aligning with the House of Duval? Even more so than his predecessors, Jordan Rochester has already ensured that history will remember his family's name. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A series of successful operations against the League of Reparation has led to much of the terrorist group being dismantled. But while the group has been dealt a severe blow, agents have yet to identify the organisation's coordinator, Nexus.

Meanwhile, an independent report suggests that a fringe Thargoid-worshipping cult may in fact be harbouring undercover Thargoid agents. A leading exotheologian responded by saying that he did not believe the group to be a threat, despite its unsettling beliefs.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho has compiled a profile on Jordan Rochester, fianc\u00e9 of Princess Aisling Duval, for The Imperial Herald. The article documents Rochester's family history, and raises the question of how he will balance being both a Federal statesman and an Imperial consort.

In other news, celebrated author Olav Redcourt has begun a promotional tour that will take him to over fifty destinations throughout the core systems. The tour will support Redcourt's new novel, 'Corsair King and the Storm of Desire', the fourteenth in a series of swashbuckling historical romances set in the 27th century.

* Fringe Religion Condemns Far God Cult
The Church of Eternal Void has denounced the so-called Far God cult, which worships the Thargoids.

A spokesperson identified as Cardinal Hieronymous made this statement:

« As disciples of the Guardians, we hereby declare war on those who have sold their souls to the Thargoid demons. We vow to expunge their poisonous creed and purge them from the galaxy. »

Since this statement was made, the Church has seen a dramatic upswing in support from local communities. Juanita Bishop, who has been campaigning against the Far God sect, commented:

« It's about time somebody did something! The public need to get behind the Church and help them get these alien-lovers off our streets. »

Security forces in many systems have issued reminders that the Far God sect is legally recognised as a religion, and that any hostility against its members will be considered a criminal act.

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian, discussed the situation on the Rewired news feed:

« A number of doomsayer cults have emerged recently, including Homo Terminus, Nova Imperium and the Order of Extinction. But of all those I've studied, the Church of Eternal Void differs in one key respect \u2013 it offers hope. They claim that veneration of the Guardians will prevent Thargoid Armageddon, which is probably why they're the most popular, being based on a classic binary theology of good versus evil. »

« It's apparent that the Church is taking advantage of animosity towards the Far God sect to promote itself. The idea of Thargoid spies in human form, although baseless, has caused much anxiety. By declaring the Cult a holy adversary, the Church validates its own existence. »


* Didiomanja Emperor's Grace Academy Campaign Concludes
The Didiomanja Emperor's Grace Academy has announced that its initiative has reached a successful conclusion. Large quantities of exotic food and drink, and mined resources, were delivered to Leydenfrost Dock over the past week, allowing the organisation to host a sumptuous banquet and construct a monument in honour of Admiral Mira Tiverion.

A spokesperson for the Didiomanja Emperor's Grace Academy released the following statement:

« That was a banquet fit for an emperor. The food was sumptuous, the drink exquisite, and the revelry went on well into the early hours. I am certain Admiral Tiverion would have approved. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Leydenfrost Dock, in the Didiomanja system.


* Ebor Research Outpost
Cobra Wing, an independent organisation based in Ebor, has launched an initiative to build a new research outpost in the system.

The outpost will support further research into the Thargoids, focusing specifically on the possibility of inter-species communication.

A spokesperson for Cobra Wing gave the following statement:

« Without communication, there can be no understanding. Without understanding, there can be no peace. We ask the galactic community to support this campaign, which will support new research into the Thargoids and their methods of communication. »

In support of this goal, Cobra Wing has placed an open order for various commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Morris Enterprise in the Ebor system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 12th July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Alliance Admiral Detained
A member of the Alliance Council of Admirals has been arrested by the taskforce investigating terrorist organisation the League of Reparation.

Admiral George Varma was confronted by Captain Niamh Seutonia and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez during a meeting of admiralty staff at the Donaldson starport in Alioth. Despite protests, he was placed under arrest and escorted to a secure facility.

Captain Seutonia gave a brief statement to the media:

« We have been trying to determine how the League of Reparation gained access to military-issue weapons, equipment and encryption. We now have evidence that Admiral Varma was secretly redirecting cargo shipments from the Alliance Defence Force to terrorist cells. It's highly likely that Varma is Nexus, the organisation's coordinator, and we are proceeding on that assumption. »

The arrest has created diplomatic ripples, with Federal and Imperial ambassadors being summoned before the Alliance Assembly. Council member Jed Trager told The Alliance Tribune:

« For agents of the Federal Intelligence Agency and Imperial Internal Security Service to abduct an Alliance admiral is an egregious transgression. They will not get away with this. »

The Council of Admirals has called for an independent inquiry to verify the accusations levied at Admiral Varma. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made a public statement:

« This has come as a great shock, but the body of evidence against Admiral Varma is considerable. I am confident that the trial will be fair, and that our own representative within the tri-superpower taskforce will ensure that justice is done. »

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.


* Details of Aisling Duval's Wedding Announced
The wedding of Princess Aisling Duval and Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester is now in the advanced planning stages, and a date has been confirmed for the ceremony.

An official proclamation was printed in both The Federal Times and The Imperial Herald:

« Her Imperial Highness Princess Aisling Duval and the honourable Ambassador Jordan Rochester are pleased to announce the occasion of their wedding on Saturday 25th August 3304 at the Imperial Palace on Emerald in the Cemiess system. »

« Invitations have been extended to representatives of every strata of society. An honour guard of vessels from both the Federal Navy and the Imperial Navy will be in attendance. The couple's wish is for all citizens of the galaxy to join together in celebration of their union. »

There has been criticism of Princess Duval's choice of husband, with some Imperial citizens voicing dismay at the forthcoming nuptials. Senator Zemina Torval continued to publicly air her disapproval:

« This is nothing but a PR exercise, designed purely for political and financial gain. The princess should not be undermining the Empire's policies for her own personal benefit. »

But there is equal support for what many consider a genuine romance. Former Federal President Jasmina Halsey, now acting as an advisor to the Alliance, stated:

« I am very enthusiastic about the opportunities for peace that this marriage will bring. This relationship symbolises a new era of amity that will benefit all of humanity. »


* Search for Lottery Winner
An appeal has been launched to find the owner of a lottery ticket worth one billion credits.

The Federal Grand Lottery is the largest of its kind, regularly handing out millions of credits. The Grand Lottery also funds a wide range of social and infrastructure projects in Federation systems.

The annual Galactic Jackpot is by far the most popular lottery game, but on this occasion the winner has yet to make a claim. Purchase of the winning ticket has been confirmed, but no data is available as to who bought the ticket or when.

Tori Theopolis, a spokesperson for the Federal Grand Lottery, told the media:

« Someone out there is rich beyond his or her wildest dreams \u2013 they just don't know it yet. We're keen to find this lucky individual so we can hand over their winnings. We ask all citizens to check with any lottery players they know. Your soon-to-be-billionaire friend or relative might be very grateful for your help! »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Admiral George Varma of the Alliance Council of Admirals has been arrested by the taskforce investigating terrorist organisation the League of Reparation. Admiral Varma stands accused of redirecting cargo shipments from the Alliance Defence Force to terrorist cells. It is thought that Varma is the organisation's coordinator, operating under the alias Nexus.

The Church of Eternal Void has declared war on the so-called Far God cult, which worships the Thargoids. The announcement has prompted a dramatic upswing in support for the Church, but security forces have issued reminders that the Far God sect is recognised as a religion, and that any hostility against its members would be considered a criminal act.

A date has been set for the wedding of Princess Aisling Duval and Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester. Senator Zemina Torval remains a vocal critic of the marriage, but Former Federal President Jasmina Halsey has expressed enthusiasm for the union.

* Identity of Nexus Confirmed
Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt of Alliance Interpol has broken her silence regarding the League of Reparation.

At a special press conference, she made this announcement:

« Prior to her death at the hands of the League of Reparation, I worked closely with my predecessor Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride. She revealed how Fleet Admiral Buchanan's assassination could only have been arranged by a senior figure within the Alliance Defence Force. She was patiently amassing evidence pertaining to this \u2013 a task that I inherited when she died. »

« Information decrypted from the League's comms network has confirmed Kilbride's suspicions. I can also confirm that the arrest of Admiral George Varma was due to false leads \u2013 misdirection on the part of Varma's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 within the Alliance Defence Force, Rear Admiral Riri McAllister. »

« Rear Admiral McAllister is Nexus, the League's central coordinator. She has now been arrested and formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. We have released Admiral Varma with our apologies. »

« The decrypted data has also revealed the location of two major League enclaves. The taskforce is organising an operation to eradicate these groups, which we hope will be supported by the galactic community. »

Council Member Jed Trager was also present at the conference, and remarked:

« We all owe a debt of gratitude to Inspector Klatt and the late Chief Inspector Kilbride. Thanks to their dedication, Nexus has at last been unmasked. Hopefully this marks the end of the League's reign of terror. »


* An Interview with Aisling Duval
Princess Aisling Duval has discussed her forthcoming marriage in an exclusive interview with entertainment journalist Solomon Helios.

The princess spoke openly about many topics, including the impact of her announcement:

« I was as surprised as everyone else! After the ball for the Federal delegation, things moved very quickly. Perhaps I should have been more patient, but I wanted people to know my intentions as soon as possible. »

On her relationship with Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, she said:

« I had met Jordan a few times at diplomatic events, and we always got on well. He's much warmer and funnier than one would expect an ambassador to be. I don't know how I managed without him for so long. »

She also tackled criticism from Senator Zemina Torval, among others:

« Any negativity around this wedding is based on prejudice and fear. Shouldn't we all be free to love whomever we wish? Maybe if Zemina was capable of such an emotion, she might understand. »

Regarding the future, Princess Duval revealed:

« Jordan and I see this marriage as an opportunity for change. Imagine a galaxy where both superpowers work hand in hand, and support each other in times of hardship. Now that's a true marriage. »

Solomon Helios concluded the interview with this comment:

« I'd like to sincerely thank Her Imperial Highness for speaking to us, and I'm especially happy to have received an invitation to the wedding of the century! I'll be reporting on every detail of this historic union in weeks to come. »

* Hunt the League of Reparation
A tri-superpower taskforce has launched a campaign to track down and eliminate members of terrorist group, the League of Reparation.

Captain Niamh Seutonia of the IISS, who is a prominent member of the taskforce, made this announcement:

« With the arrest of Riri McAllister, otherwise known as Nexus, we now hold the main coordinator of the League of Reparation in custody. Furthermore, decrypted information has revealed the location of League strongholds in two separate systems, one in Imperial and one in Federal space. »

« We are determined to eliminate these terrorists before they can wreak any more havoc, but fully expect tough resistance. Therefore we ask the galactic community to provide support in wiping out these dangerous extremists. »

The operation in Zibal will be coordinated by Zibal Power Co. Likewise, military action in Ienpalang will be supported by Ienpalang Corporation.

The campaign begins on the 19th of July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Cobra Wing Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for the Cobra Wing has announced that its campaign to build a research outpost in the Ebor system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Morris Enterprise and eliminating agitators in Ebor, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

A spokesperson for the Cobra Wing released the following statement:

« We want to thank all the Commanders who supported this campaign. We hope that the new outpost helps us communicate with our neighbours and achieve peace. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Morris Enterprise in the Ebor system.


* Unexploded Nuclear Missile Discovered
A thermonuclear weapon, launched over a thousand years ago during Earth's Third World War, has been discovered.

The intercontinental ballistic missile was found beneath the Pacific Ocean, during construction of new undersea habitation off the coast of California.

Lieutenant Commander Page Patterson, a munitions-disposal specialist for the Federal Navy, gave this statement:

« The missile was partially embedded in the ocean floor when aqua-engineering teams found it. Erosion of the casing makes identification difficult, but the design is consistent with strategic ordnance of the mid-21st century. Its thermonuclear warhead would have had an explosive yield of 45 megatons. »

« Robotic avatar units have successfully disarmed the missile's uranium core, so the risk to local populations has been nullified. We are now treating the area for radiation leakage. The remains of the missile will be scrapped. »

Dr Imogen Ryang, a historian specialising in Earth conflicts, observed:

« A variety of relics from World War III, which took place between 2044 and 2055, have been found over the centuries. All nuclear exchanges between nation states were thought to be well documented, so this discovery comes as quite a shock. »

« Although the missile's origin remains a mystery, its location near the western seaboard suggests two possibilities. Either it was a failed launch from a silo in the United States, or it was an inbound enemy missile that failed to reach its target. In the latter case, it was likely disabled by the USA's defensive laser grid, which combined ground turrets with armed satellites. This was how America avoided a nuclear detonation on its soil during the war, unlike most other continents on Earth. »


* Far God Cult Attacked
There has been a spate of violence against the Thargoid-worshipping Far God cult, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.

Since the Church of Eternal Void declared war against the sect, its members have compelled citizens to attack Far God believers in many systems. Several of the sect's places of worship have been firebombed.

The Far God cultists have offered no resistance to the aggression, and have even refused to leave burning hive-chapels.

Cardinal Hieronymous, representing the Church of Eternal Void, addressed a large crowd:

« Our loyal followers are performing the Guardians' righteous work! Those who serve the Thargoid demons are demons themselves, and we must cast them out with fire and fury. »

A vocal campaigner against the Far God sect, Juanita Bishop, told the media:

« It might not be pretty, but what's happening now is no different to what our brave pilots are doing out there in space \u2013 defending their own kind. We will do whatever it takes to protect our children from these monsters. »

Local security forces have been slow to respond to the incidents, and few arrests have been made. Councillor Quinn Damico commented:

« The lack of an immediate clampdown is inexcusable. The Church is inciting criminal acts and persecuting a legally registered religion. I call upon the authorities to bring the full force of the law against any vigilante behaviour. »

Mara Klatt of Alliance Interpol has announced that Admiral George Varma, who was arrested last week on suspicion of working with terrorist organisation the League of Reparation, was in fact framed by Rear Admiral Riri McAllister. It is now believed that McAllister is Nexus, the League's central coordinator.

Following this development, information decrypted by a tri-superpower taskforce has revealed the location of League strongholds in two systems \u2013 one in Imperial and one in Federal space. A two-pronged operation to destroy these enclaves is now underway.

Princess Aisling Duval has discussed her forthcoming marriage in an interview with Solomon Helios. The princess insisted that any negativity surrounding the wedding was based on prejudice and fear, saying, « Shouldn't we all be free to love whomever we wish? »

Meanwhile, there has been a spate of violence against the Thargoid-worshipping Far God cult, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The Far God cultists have offered no resistance to the aggression. Local security forces have been slow to respond to the incidents, and few arrests have been made.

In other news, a thermonuclear weapon, launched over a thousand years ago during Earth's Third World War, has been discovered. The intercontinental ballistic missile was found beneath the Pacific Ocean, during construction of new undersea habitation off the coast of California. The missile's uranium core has been disarmed and the risk to local populations nullified.

Finally, a spokesperson for the Cobra Wing has announced that its campaign to build a research outpost in the Ebor system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Morris Enterprise and eliminating agitators in Ebor, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

And those are the main stories this week.

* Guardian-Worshipping Church Declared Illegal
The Church of Eternal Void, a fringe group that venerates the Guardians, has been declared illegal in every system where it operates.

Cardinal Hieronymous and other senior members of the Church have been arrested for inciting acts of violence against the so-called 'Far God' sect, which worships the Thargoids. The death toll among the Far God sect is now in the hundreds, with many more injured.

Councillor Quinn Damico praised the declaration:

« All citizens have the freedom to practise any religion they choose, provided that religion does not sanction homicide. Authorities have made the right move to prevent further bloodshed. »

The decision was condemned by Juanita Bishop, who runs a campaign against the Far God sect:

« So the sick Thargoid-lovers can walk free, while those with the courage to oppose them are put behind bars. It's the traitors who worship the enemy that should be illegal! This perversion of justice will backfire on us, mark my words. »

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune made this statement:

« The ability to distinguish between laws and beliefs is the mark of a civilised society. In this case we consider the Far God sect to be the victim rather than the aggressor, despite the controversial nature of their faith. »


* League of Reparation Hunt Concludes
The tri-power taskforce whose goal is to eradicate the League of Reparation has announced a successful conclusion to its recent campaign. Scores of pilots supported the taskforce by eliminating League terrorists in the Zibal and Ienpalang systems.

As the campaign drew to a close, Captain Niamh Seutonia had this to say:

« The League of Reparation put up a good fight, just what we've come to expect from these fanatics, but we prevailed in the end. With the aid of the galactic community, we have now taken a bold step in eradicating this terrorist organisation once and for all. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative in the Zibal system can now collect their rewards from Hire Port. Pilots who contributed to the initiative in the Ienpalang system can now collect their rewards from Brundage City.


* Alliance Initiative
The Alliance has announced plans to build an Ocellus starport in the MEL 22 Sector GM-V C2-8 system, to further bridge the gap between the core systems and the Alliance's outposts in the California Nebula.

Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:

« Our previous initiative established a link between our outposts in the California Nebula and the galactic core. But to ensure the safety and wellbeing of travellers following the route, we need to maintain a robust programme of starport construction. »

The initiative is being overseen by the Turner Research Group, which has placed an open order for mined resources to be used in the construction. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 26th of July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Rochester Family Attacked
Members of the Rochester family have come under personal and political attack following the engagement of Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester to Princess Aisling Duval.

Several media outlets shared news of an incident involving Jordan Rochester's teenage niece:

« A physical assault against Kali Rochester was reported on campus at Olympus Village University yesterday. Students surrounded Ms Rochester and accosted her while chanting anti-Imperial slogans. The assault was repelled by her private security detail. »

Meanwhile, Kali's father Jupiter Rochester was featured in a financial report from The Federal Times:

« Core Dynamics stock dropped by 18 per cent this month, undoubtedly due to the CEO's family being linked with an Imperial princess. Jupiter Rochester has come under fire from both shareholders and management, who are concerned that one of the Federation's bedrocks might be losing his integrity. »

Questions have also been asked in Congress of Isolde Rochester, Jordan Rochester's mother. Many congressmen have demanded assurances that the Federation will not relinquish influence or territory to the Empire in the wake of the marriage.

Isolde Rochester released the following statement:

« Conservative elements always react negatively to change, even when that change is in society's best interest. My son's relationship with Her Imperial Highness represents not just a union between the Rochesters and the House of Duval, but the start of a new era of cooperation that will strengthen us all. »


* League of Reparation Eliminated
The League of Reparation has been dismantled, according to the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the organisation.

Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service made this statement:

« Following the decryption of the League's comms network, we have now arrested or eliminated every member of the organisation. The galactic community provided significant support by destroying the League's strongholds in Federal and Imperial space. Thanks to their efforts, the League of Reparation has been defeated. »

Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt spoke to the media about Riri McAllister, now known to be Nexus, the League's central coordinator:

« McAllister voluntarily revealed a surprising amount of information during questioning. It seems the League began building its forces a few years ago, recruiting misguided obsessives and mercenaries. They targeted INRA descendants to whom they could gain easy access, murdering dozens of innocent people. »

« After Commander Jameson's ship was discovered, the League started targeting high-profile individuals and leaving the 'For Jameson' message. This was designed to generate exposure and spread terror to families with an INRA connection. »

« McAllister has confessed to being the original architect of the League. As for her motivation, she insists she is a direct descendant of Commander John Jameson, and that her duty was to avenge his death. »

« In fact, McAllister is registered as an orphan of unknown lineage, meaning that we cannot verify her claim. Our suspicion is that this is a long-held delusion or a product of a psychological disorder. »

Alliance Interpol later confirmed that McAllister had been charged with multiple terrorism-related crimes. Her trial will be held shortly.


* Classic Children's Show Returns
A children's entertainment show that achieved great popularity 40 years ago is being remade for modern audiences.

The animated programme, which featured spacefaring camel-like lifeforms from another galaxy, was titled Andromedaries. After many years, its devoted fanbase has raised funding for an independent entertainment company to purchase the rights.

A press release from Blackshadow Productions stated:

« This new incarnation of Andromedaries will delight fans both old and new. We'll be going on a dark, blood-soaked journey of psychological discovery, showcasing all the trials and pressures of intergalactic travel. »

Vienna Langhorne, the creator and head writer of the original show, commented:

« It's about camels in space, for goodness' sake! What are these morons doing to it? »

Ogden Smith, president of the Andromedaries Superlative Society, told the media:

« With all due respect to Vienna Langhorne, she doesn't understand the show like we do. The new version will return viewers to the gritty, realistic drama we enjoyed when we were kids. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

The League of Reparation has been dismantled, according to the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the organisation. The announcement followed a successful operation to remove League forces from two systems \u2013 one in Federal and one in Imperial space. Riri McAllister, the League's central coordinator, has been charged with multiple terrorism-related crimes.

The Church of Eternal Void, a fringe group that venerates the Guardians, has been declared illegal in every system where it operates. Cardinal Hieronymous and other senior members of the Church have been arrested for inciting acts of violence against the so-called 'Far God' sect, which worships the Thargoids.

Meanwhile, members of the Rochester family have come under attack following the engagement of Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester to Princess Aisling Duval. Jordan Rochester's niece Kali Rochester was the victim of a physical assault, while her father Jupiter Rochester, a Core Dynamics executive, has come under fire from both shareholders and management.

In other news, the classic children's show Andromedaries, about spacefaring camel-like lifeforms, is being remade for modern audiences. The production company behind the reboot has promised a « dark, blood-soaked journey of psychological discovery », prompting dismay from the creator and writer of the original programme, Vienna Langhorne.

Finally, the Alliance has announced plans to build a new Ocellus starport to further bridge the gap between the core systems and the Alliance's outposts in the California Nebula. The organisation overseeing the initiative has placed an open order for mined resources to be used in the construction.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Author Abandons Interstellar Book Tour
Celebrated author Olav Redcourt has abandoned the promotional tour for his latest novel, halfway through a two-month circuit of fifty systems.

Reporters managed to catch Mr Redcourt as he was storming off the passenger liner where he has spent the last four weeks. He told them:

« I'm sick of churning out historical-romance garbage, especially now that readers can change the damn story to suit themselves! I'm going to write the book I've always wanted to write \u2013 a science-fiction saga set in the future. »

A statement was released by Bonespire Publishing:

« Unfortunately this incident constitutes a breach of contract, as Mr Redcourt has only produced fourteen Corsair King novels, rather than the twenty-five we agreed. We hope we can convince him to resume the tour and continue with the series. »

Margaux Hist, the author's agent, commented:

« Olav's a true artist, so I'm sure fans will understand that he wants a little creative freedom. I can't tell you anything about the new title yet, but science-fiction is a niche genre with a tiny audience, so I hope it sells well enough to pay Olav's legal bills. »

* Aranbarahun Purple Creative Campaign
Aranbarahun Purple Creative, an independent organisation based in the Aranbarahun system, has announced plans to build a massive cargo ship to transport goods out of the booming system.

In support of this goal, Aranbarahun Purple Creative has placed an open order for various commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Barnes Terminal in the Aranbarahun system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 2nd of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Alliance Initiative Concludes
The Alliance has announced that its appeal for mined resources has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. Huge quantities of raw material were delivered to California Gateway over the past week, which will be used to construct an Ocellus starport in the MEL 22 Sector GM-V C2-8 system.

With the campaign at an end, Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:

« We are grateful for the efforts made by those pilots who helped bring this initiative to fruition. Construction of this starport will make the long journey to the California Nebula safer for traders and colonists alike. »

Construction of the new starport is expected to begin soon. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from California Gateway in the Synuefai EB-R C7-5 system.


* Riri McAllister Shot
Former rear admiral Riri McAllister has been shot. She is currently undergoing medical treatment.

The incident took place at the Alliance Chamber of Justice on Turner's World in the Alioth system. McAllister was on trial for organising acts of terrorism as Nexus, founder of the League of Reparation.

Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt, who was delivering prosecuting evidence at the trial, briefed the media:

« Shortly after McAllister took the stand she was struck by a single shot from the visitors' gallery. She is now in intensive care and awaiting transport to an advanced medical facility. Assuming she recovers, the trial will continue at a later date. »

« The shooter has been identified as Polly Cartesius, daughter of Nestor Cartesius, an Imperial senator murdered by the League of Reparation. She used a concealed laser firearm specially designed to avoid security scans. She did not resist arrest, and it is clear that this was an act of revenge for her father's death. As she is an Imperial citizen, we have extradited her to the care of the IISS. »

Polly Cartesius was last seen in public two weeks ago during her father's ceremonial funeral, which saw his body entombed in the Hall of Martyrs beneath the Imperial Palace. It is thought that she travelled to Alliance space using false identification.

Captain Niamh Seutonia has taken Ms Cartesius into custody and returned with her to Capitol, where she will stand trial for attempted murder.


* Aisling Duval Assassination Foiled
An attempt to assassinate Princess Aisling Duval has been prevented by the Imperial Internal Security Service.

The attempt occurred in the Zhao system during a fundraising event for Unchain, the anti-slavery charity formed by the princess and campaigner Jarl Toredo.

Captain Takio Diomedes of the IISS gave this statement:

« Shortly after the fundraiser began, Princess Duval's security detail detected explosive charges in key locations across the event centre. We immediately evacuated the building. The explosives, which were of amateur design, were disabled. Forensic analysis is underway to determine their origin. »

Aisling Duval has not addressed the incident, and is continuing her fundraising duties for Unchain. Her fianc\u00e9, Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, made this comment:

« Had the explosives not been found, they would have killed hundreds of innocent people. Aisling and I are grateful to both Federal and Imperial security services, which are working together to ensure our safety. This is a splendid example of inter-power cooperation, which we hope will soon be commonplace. »


* Far God Cult under Investigation
The Federal Intelligence Agency has launched an investigation into the Far God cult. Several members of the sect have been arrested for interrogation.

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield of the FIA released this statement:

« Given the organisation's proclaimed interest in the Thargoids, it is vital that we confirm they are not in contact with Thargoid forces, or being influenced by them. The FIA is working with local security agencies across many systems to ascertain the truth. »

The Rewired news service has broadcast footage of armed Federal troops forcing their way into the cult's hive-chapels and dragging cult members into armoured vehicles. There was no sign of resistance from the Far God adherents.

Other video feeds show groups of citizens trying to shield the Far God worshippers, while rival groups can be seen cheering on the soldiers.

Juanita Bishop, who runs a campaign against the Far God sect, told the media:

« We knew these foul cultists were Thargoid spies. Now we're going to be proved correct. They should have been rounded up and executed weeks ago. »

* Jarl Toredo Resigns from Unchain
Campaigner Jarl Toredo has resigned from Unchain, the anti-slavery organisation he founded with Princess Aisling Duval.

Unchain's press office released this statement:

« We can confirm that Jarl Toredo has officially resigned from his position as co-chief executive officer, effective immediately. Princess Duval remains our patron and CEO. We wish Mr Toredo all the best with his future endeavours. »

Reema Falco, a journalist writing for The Imperial Herald, made these observations:

« Considering Toredo's passionate rhetoric against Imperial slavery, it's surprising for him to abandon an organisation that he co-founded. The recent assassination attempt against Princess Duval at an Unchain fundraiser may have caused him to regret allying with such a volatile political figure. »

« As yet, there is no comment from Her Imperial Highness. This has led to speculation that there was a falling-out between the two. Rumours of a romance between them never quite went away, even after the princess's engagement to Jordan Rochester. Is this perhaps a jealous rival storming off in a fit of pique? »

Representatives from Unchain have said that their campaigning, fundraising and slave-liberation programmes will continue as normal.


* Pleiades Rescue Operation
After sustained Thargoid attacks on civilian targets in the Pleiades Nebula, system authorities have launched a rescue operation to locate and recover survivors.

The operation is being coordinated by Superintendent Marla Poulsen of Aegis Research, who made this announcement:

« System authorities in the Pleiades have been channelling their resources into combating the Thargoid menace. As a result, search-and-rescue initiatives have been neglected, but we are determined to plug that gap. That means a lot of civilians rescued from escape pods, which also means a lot of hungry mouths to feed, so we'll need to bolster our current food stocks as a precautionary measure. »

Pilots are requested to recover occupied escape pods and damaged escape pods. In addition, the following food resources are also required: fruit and vegetables, grain and food cartridges. Both recovered pods and food stocks should be delivered to Donar's Oak in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.

The campaign begins on the 9th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Aranbarahun Campaign Concludes
A spokesperson for Aranbarahun Purple Creative has announced that its campaign to build a cargo ship has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Barnes Terminal and by eliminating agitators in Aranbarahun, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Barnes Terminal in the Aranbarahun system.


* Further Arrests of Far God Cultists
The Federal Intelligence Agency has apprehended further members of the Far God cult, to determine if they are communicating with the Thargoids.

Media channels report a division in public opinion regarding the FIA's actions. Some see the arrests as illegal and tantamount to religious persecution. Others claim that the Far God worshippers have invited suspicion upon themselves, and that the detainments are justified.

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented:

« We strongly oppose this hostility against the Far God sect. These arrests are motivated by fear rather than evidence. We must fight for the civil rights of our fellow citizens, even if we do not share their beliefs. »

A prominent campaigner against the Far God cult, Juanita Bishop, told the media:

« This is a victory for right-thinking people everywhere. Those warped alien-lovers are a blight on our system \u2013 one that should have been eradicated long ago. »

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield of the FIA stated:

« This operation is purely a security matter. Under Federal law, any action that undermines enemy activity during wartime is legal, including the suspension of civil liberties. We are expanding our investigation to include all members of this organisation and anyone with a connection to it. »


* The Death of Nexus?
A medical ship transporting the injured Riri McAllister has vanished and is presumed destroyed. Former rear admiral McAllister was on trial on Turner's World for her crimes as Nexus, the founder of terrorist group the League of Reparation. After being shot by the daughter of the assassinated Senator Nestor Cartesius, McAllister was to be taken to an advanced medical facility.

Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt made this statement:

« Having lost contact with the vessel we despatched ships to its last known location. We found only debris, suggesting the ship was attacked and either vaporised or hijacked. Either way, we assume the transport's crew to be dead. »

« This may have been another act of vengeance from those affected by the League's fanaticism. Alternatively, someone connected to the League may have wanted to silence McAllister to prevent her from revealing information. It's also plausible that this was a rescue mission, and that McAllister was liberated by surviving members of the League. »

« The League of Reparation is no longer considered a threat. As such, the tri-superpower taskforce formed to investigate them has been disbanded. Agents from Alliance Interpol, the Federal Intelligence Agency and the Imperial Internal Security Service have returned to their regular duties. »

« Meanwhile, Riri McAllister has been listed as missing rather than dead. Although her survival is unlikely, we cannot ignore the risk that the woman once known as Nexus may one day reappear to pursue her twisted beliefs. »


* Rogue Robot Missing
A malfunctioning mining robot has run amok through a settlement on Homeland in the Beta Hydri system.

The robot in question was a MacArthur Mining Ltd DG090 model, designed to extract and process minerals from asteroids. It was one of ten brand-new robots being loaded onto an orbital cargo shuttle.

Video feeds show the huge machine self-activating and breaking out of its container. It used its mining lasers, fusion drills and excavator claws to carve a path across the landing field. The robot then burrowed into the ground and disappeared.

Security Chief Sara Kulkarni gave the following statement to the media:

« Sensor drones are performing subterranean scans, but have not yet located the robot. We have therefore declared a regional state of emergency. Should the machine accidentally rupture a water main or pierce an underground power line, the potential for significant damage \u2013 even loss of life \u2013 is high. »

Director Chen Emerson of MacArthur Mining Ltd made this statement:

« We are shocked by this incident, and an urgent inquiry is underway. The DG090 series is highly reliable and has never malfunctioned before. Our theory is that, due to human error, the unit was placed in the incorrect standby mode, and that stray signals from a nearby comms network triggered a preset program. We are supporting all efforts to locate the robot and shut it down. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A ship transporting former rear admiral Riri McAllister has vanished. McAllister, also known as Nexus, was on trial for her crimes as the founder of terrorist group the League of Reparation. While it is likely that the ship was destroyed by the League's enemies, the possibility that McAllister was liberated by surviving members of the League has not been ruled out.

Meanwhile, campaigner Jarl Toredo has resigned from Unchain, the anti-slavery organisation he founded with Princess Aisling Duval. His resignation has prompted speculation about a possible disagreement between him and Duval, with commentators citing earlier rumours of a romance between the pair.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has apprehended further members of the Far God cult, to determine if the sect is communicating with the Thargoids. Some see the arrests as tantamount to religious persecution, while others claim that the Far God worshippers have invited suspicion upon themselves, and that the detainments are justified.

In other news, a malfunctioning mining robot has run amok through a settlement on Homeland in the Beta Hydri system. Sensor drones are now searching for the robot, which tunnelled underground after breaking out of its container. Security personnel are hoping to find the machine before it causes any serious damage.

After sustained Thargoid attacks on civilian targets in the Pleiades Nebula, system authorities have launched a rescue operation to locate and recover survivors. Pilots have been asked to help with the operation, and also to contribute foods so those rescued can be adequately fed.

Finally, a spokesperson for Aranbarahun Purple Creative has announced that its campaign to build a cargo ship has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Barnes Terminal and by eliminating agitators in Aranbarahun, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

* Rogue Robot Located
A mining robot that went out of control on Homeland in the Beta Hydri system has been located and disabled.

The MacArthur Mining Ltd DG090 machine disappeared after self-activating and tunnelling underground. It remained lost for several days before being discovered over a hundred kilometres from where it malfunctioned.

Security Chief Sara Kulkarni gave this report:

« Our sensor drones detected the robot as it surfaced in the Blue Peaks mountain range. We believe it was obeying its primary programming by homing in on mineral ores. Federal Navy gunships were immediately dispatched. Once located, the robot was partially destroyed from the air before it could cause any further damage. »

Director Chen Emerson of MacArthur Mining Ltd commented:

« An inspection of the robot's remains confirmed our suspicion that it had been placed in the incorrect standby mode. Its comms array was then disrupted by local signals, activating a pre-set mining program. The DG090 series is very reliable, and this unfortunate incident should not be perceived as a blemish on its excellent reputation. »


* Colonia Hydroponics Initiative
Authorities in Colonia have decided to build a state-of-the-art hydroponics facility, due to research projecting a possible food shortage in the region.

Professor Diana VanCleef, a scientific adviser to the Colonia Council, gave the following statement:

« The growing populace of Colonia means we need to provide a reliable and sustainable source of food for the region. We aim to address this by building a new hydroponics facility that will serve Colonia for generations to come. »

The campaign is being run by Colonia Research Division, one of Colonia's partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver the requested mined resources to Templar Barracks in the Randgnid system.

The campaign begins on the 16th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Restoring Order in Kamici
Authorities in the Kamici system have reported a distressing rise in the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that these felons are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing mayhem.

To counter this threat, Kamici Incorporated has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Gaiman Port.

The campaign begins on 16th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Eagle Eye Installations Offline
Admiral Aden Tanner has confirmed reports that Aegis's Eagle Eye installations are offline.

The development is the result of Thargoid-sensor related interference at Dantec Enterprise, home of Aegis Core, which has neutralised Aegis's ability to transmit data to the orbital installations.

The Eagle Eye installations play a vital role in countering Thargoid aggression by monitoring energy-level fluctuations at Thargoid surface sites. The data allows pilots to determine which systems the Thargoids intend to attack.

Admiral Tanner elaborated on the issue in a brief statement:

« With Dantec Enterprise experiencing widespread technical issues, it's impossible for us to communicate with the Eagle Eye installations. And unless the installations are fed a continuous stream of data, they are essentially useless. »

« The Eagle Eye installations are one of the most effective weapons we have in our war against the Thargoids, and we would be grateful to any pilots who could deliver meta-alloys to Dantec Enterprise, to help us get the starport back online. »


* Billionaire Wins Lottery
Renowned billionaire Zachary Rackham, owner of Rackham Capital Investments, has been confirmed as the winner of a lottery prize of one billion credits.

Tori Theopolis, a spokesperson for the Federal Grand Lottery, announced:

« Our annual galactic jackpot has been claimed and the winning ticket verified. Our congratulations to Mr Rackham \u2013 we hope he enjoys his billion-credit prize. »

Zachary Rackham, known in some circles as 'Calico Zack', told the media:

« To be honest, this caught me by surprise. I only buy lottery tickets out of habit, a holdover from the days when I used to rattle around space in a rusty old Sidewinder. Naturally I'll be donating this windfall to various charitable programmes. »

The Federal Times published this observation from financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:

« It's highly suspicious that a billionaire should play the lottery, and even more suspicious that he should win it. I'm sure that Calico Zack's accountants will indeed put this money to good use \u2013 paying the gargantuan bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to his company. Once a pirate, always a pirate. »


* New Computer Designs Announced
Federal Times journalist Harlow Nassry has highlighted two new personal computer designs currently in development:

« For a long time, the Sirius and Achilles corporations have been the main suppliers of personal computing devices, but two smaller companies are aiming to challenge that monopoly. »

« The first company, Supratech, is working on a revolutionary design called the Torc, a flexible ring that coils around the user's wrist or neck. It uses high-resolution holographic projectors to surround the user with illuminated displays and motion-sensitive interfaces. »

« The second company, Herculean Machines, has taken a more down-to-earth approach. The Duradrive is a chunky, durable tablet designed to withstand rough handling. Herculean has promised a range of peripherals, allowing users to custom-build their own version of the device. »

« Both companies plan to reveal prototypes of their designs at a technology expo in October. But can the market support two rival products? We'll no doubt be hearing more about the Torc and Duradrive in the near future. »


* Pleiades Rescue Operation Concludes
A spokesperson for the Aegis Research has announced that its rescue operation in the Pleiades has been enthusiastically assisted by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the operation by delivering stranded survivors and commodities to Donar's Oak in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.

Superintendent Marla Poulsen of Aegis Research released the following statement:

« The number of rescued survivors we have received is truly fantastic. We have also received enough food stocks to ensure that they're well taken care of, before moving them to dedicated refugee centres. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Donar's Oak in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.


* Ulyanov Arrested
Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian and an authority on the Far God cult, has been apprehended as a suspected Thargoid sympathiser.

The arrest took place at Dr Ulyanov's home in the Rana system, where he and his family were taken into custody by the Federal Intelligence Agency. Research materials and computer systems were also removed from the property, according to witnesses.

Professor Siobhan Vogel of the Interstellar Association of Universities registered a formal complaint:

« For Dr Ulyanov's academic studies to be viewed as evidence that he is some kind of Thargoid agent is utterly ridiculous. This violation of his rights sets a dangerous precedent. »

Federal Intelligence Agency Senior Agent Micah Whitefield gave the following statement:

« When it comes to possible Thargoid allies, we cannot afford to overlook anything. Dr Ulyanov's involvement with the Far God cult makes him a valid person of interest. We are also investigating the Galactic Interfaith Commune, the Spiritual Freedom Movement and other organisations that have supported Thargoid worshippers. »

Juanita Bishop, whose campaign against the Far God sect has continued to attract popular support, commented:

« This proves that there are Thargoid collaborators among us, in all walks of life. We must root them out before they start murdering innocent people. »


* Aisling Duval's Secret Relationship Revealed
Anti-slavery campaigner Jarl Toredo has disclosed that he and Princess Aisling Duval have been conducting a secret romantic relationship, despite her betrothal to Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester.

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios gave full details on his programme:

« Following Jarl Toredo's resignation from Unchain, I offered to tell his side of the story. Although he declined a formal interview, he did disclose that he could no longer bear working alongside Princess Duval. »

« He admitted that he has been romantically involved with the princess since their first meeting several months ago. It seems they both felt it wise to keep the relationship a secret. »

« According to Toredo, the princess claimed not to have any romantic feelings for Ambassador Rochester, and insisted that the marriage was merely a means to advance her political plans. Initially Toredo accepted this, but it seems that after her engagement the princess became unreachable. »

« Toredo says that his and Aisling's love has been sidelined by her political schemes. Quite simply, he feels betrayed. »

Princess Aisling Duval gave this response to the media:

« I am shocked that my good friend Solomon could believe such lies. It's obvious that Mr Toredo is being used by those who want rekindle the hostility between the Empire and the Federation. My relationship with Jordan Rochester is entirely genuine. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Campaigner Jarl Toredo has disclosed that he and Princess Aisling Duval have been conducting a secret romantic relationship, despite her betrothal to Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester. Toredo claims that the princess accepted Rochester's proposal only as a means to advance her political plans. Princess Duval has refuted Toredo's statement.

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian and an authority on the Far God cult, has been apprehended as a suspected Thargoid sympathiser. The Federal Intelligence Agency said that Dr Ulyanov's involvement with the Far God cult made him a valid person of interest.

Meanwhile, The Federal Times has highlighted two new personal computer designs currently in development \u2013 the Torc from Supratech, and the Duradrive from Herculean Machines. Both companies plan to reveal prototypes of their designs at a technology expo in October.

A mining robot that went out of control in the Beta Hydri system has been located and disabled. MacArthur Mining Ltd, which manufactures the robot, said that an inspection of the robot's remains confirmed suspicions that it had been placed in the incorrect standby mode, verifying that the malfunction was the result of human error.

In other news, billionaire Zachary Rackham has been confirmed as the winner of a lottery prize of one billion credits. Rackham was quick to announce that he would donate his winnings to charity, although The Federal Times pointed out that the win coincided with a bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to Rackham's company.

Finally, a spokesperson for Aegis Research has announced that its rescue operation in the Pleiades has been enthusiastically assisted by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the operation by delivering stranded survivors and commodities to Donar's Oak.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Aisling Duval Wedding Cancelled
Federal news channels have announced that the wedding of Princess Aisling Duval and Ambassador Jordan Rochester has been cancelled.

The statement came from Congress member Isolde Rochester:

« The planned wedding between my son Jordan Rochester and Her Imperial Highness will no longer take place. We have contacted everyone involved with the event and closed down all related projects. »

The announcement follows anti-slavery campaigner Jarl Toredo's confession that he and Aisling Duval were romantically involved for several months. Toredo also claimed that the planned marriage was purely a political matter.

The cancellation was confirmed by the Imperial Palace on Emerald, but there has been no direct response from Princess Duval or Ambassador Rochester.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho of The Imperial Herald commented:

« The fact that this news comes from Isolde Rochester gives weight to Jarl Toredo's claims. If the marriage was a political scheme, that may explain why the Rochester family matriarch is the one to call it off, no longer trusting Princess Duval to play her part. Or perhaps this is simply the reaction of a mother, enraged at her future daughter-in-law's infidelity. »

« Had the marriage taken place, would it have initiated an era of Federal-Imperial cooperation, or triggered a new wave of conflict? It seems we will never know. »

* Order Restored in Kamici
Kamici Incorporated has announced that its campaign to clear the Kamici system of felons has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system.

Authorities in Kamici have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Gaiman Port in the Kamici system.


* The Battle for Betel
Recent reports from the Betel system indicate that an ongoing feud between the Silver Creative Network and the Betel Free has escalated into violence.

General Hollis of Betel security issued the following statement:

« After a lengthy period of peace, these factions are now determined to wipe one another out. As much as we want to subdue this conflict ourselves, we simply do not have the ships to stage an effective intervention. »

With system security forces stretched thin, both organisations are seizing the opportunity to settle old grudges, and have issued calls for support. Pilots who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.

The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 23rd August 3304.


* Colonia Hydroponics Initiative Concludes
The Colonia Council has announced that its campaign to build a new hydroponics facility has been warmly received by the galactic community. Large quantities of material were delivered to Templar Barracks over the past week, allowing the initiative to move to the construction phase.

The Council's scientific adviser, Professor Diana VanCleef, gave the following statement:

« Not only will this new hydroponics facility provide biofoods and super-grains for the populace of Colonia, it will also contain a dedicated research laboratory for a science team to develop new biotech crops. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Templar Barracks in the Randgnid system.


* Congressman's Criminal Ties Exposed
An exclusive expos\u00e9 published by The Mars Tribune has revealed that a member of Federal Congress has close ties to a criminal organisation.

The extensive feature began with this summary:

« Congressman Morgan Unwin has been in debt to the notorious Red Family cartel for nearly a decade. Information uncovered by our reporters proves that he has used his influence to traffic enormous quantities of the cartel's drugs in order to keep his own addiction secret. »

Following publication of the feature, Mr Unwin was arrested by the Federal Security Service, and now faces expulsion from Congress. An investigation into Red Family's narcotics operation in Olympus Village is also underway.

A spokesperson for Congress made this statement:

« We are indebted to The Mars Tribune for uncovering a criminal conspiracy that might otherwise have continued undetected. This highlights the value of investigative journalism to the Federation. »

The Tribune's billionaire owner, Kingsley Cordova, has been invited to a special event by Congress to express its gratitude. As well as The Mars Tribune, his conglomerate Cordova Group runs many small companies in the Sol system.


* Far God Cultists Vanishing
The Federal Intelligence Agency has revealed that members of the Far God cult are disappearing in large numbers.

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield told the media:

« On several occasions, our agents have entered hive-chapels only to discover them completely empty. Intelligence from independent systems describes how entire chapters of the sect have disappeared overnight. »

« We suspect that adherents are starting to abandon the cult and attempting to return to normal life. We urge everyone to report such individuals to the FIA so we can investigate potential connection to the Thargoids. »

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented:

« Although it would be an understandable reaction to the FIA's relentless persecution, there are no reports of former Far God worshippers returning to their friends and families. These abrupt disappearances remain a mystery. »

Anti-cult campaigner Juanita Bishop also made a statement:

« It's obvious to me that these spies are returning to their Thargoid masters, to inform them of what they've learned. Arresting them isn't enough \u2013 we need a more permanent solution for these traitors. »


* Lakon Releases Alliance Crusader
Lakon Spaceways has announced that a new ship, the Alliance Crusader, will soon be available for purchase.

Meera Callanach, head of military projects at Lakon, gave some details to the media:

« The Alliance Crusader is mechanically similar to the Alliance Chieftain, with one key distinction. Our engineers have removed some internal hardware to accommodate a fighter bay. Inevitably, this means the Crusader is marginally slower and less manoeuvrable than its siblings, but this is compensated by its ability to ferry fighters into a conflict zone. »

« The Crusader's offensive capabilities are enhanced with three internal military compartments. We are confident that the ship will be able to hold its own in any combat situation, especially against the Thargoids. »

The Alliance Crusader will go on general sale on Tuesday the 28th of August.


* Computer Firms Promote New Designs
Rival technology companies Supratech and Herculean Machines have released press statements promoting new personal-computer designs.

Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of Supratech, told the media about his company's forthcoming product:

« The Torc employs cutting-edge holographic technology, surrounding you in a personalised world. Its holo-interfaces respond to subtle gestures and its flexible crystalline structure makes it as elegant as jewellery. By comparison, competitors' devices are as rudimentary as pen and paper. »

Maddox Hurd, owner of Herculean Machines, also made a statement:

« Fancy holograms might look pretty, but what matters is being able to withstand whatever life throws at you. The Duradrive is designed for those who work hard and expect their tools to stand up to the challenge. However tough you think you are, the Duradrive is tougher. »

Both companies have confirmed that they will be at the Rackham Ultratech Expo on Wednesday the 3rd of October. The technology trade show, sponsored by Rackham Capital Investments, focuses on the personal-device market. Both companies aim to have fully functional prototypes ready for the expo.

* Unusual Energy Signatures Detected
Three recently detected energy signatures have been confirmed to be of a similar nature.

The engineer Ram Tah made a statement to the media:

« As part of my research, I regularly review data from surveillance satellites and ships that have picked up atypical signals. Although most turn out to be of no consequence, on this occasion I have identified three energy signatures that I believe warrant further investigation. »

« The signals originate from the NGC 2451A sector, the IC 2391 sector and the Synuefe EN-H region. I have no further data, and at this time the signatures' meaning remains a mystery. »

« I encourage any independent pilots operating in these regions to investigate. I do of course apologise if this turns out to be a pointless exercise, but in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, even the smallest opportunity must be explored. »


* Engineers Established in Colonia
The Colonia Council has announced that four engineers have established bases in the Colonia region, to provide services to independent pilots.

Councillor Giselle Kingspear gave a statement to the media:

« The Council believes it has a duty to support those who contribute so much to the region's stability. That's why we have consulted with engineers in the core systems to identify individuals who could offer similar services here in Colonia. Consequently, we now have four engineers at planetary bases in the region. »

« Mel Brandon is based in Luchtaine, and specialises in laser-based armaments, shields, engines and frame shift drives. Etienne Dorn in the Los system, once lead engineer for Kraken Shield Specialists, is an expert on sensors, scanners and high-energy weaponry, among other things. Petra Olmanova is in the Asura system, and works with ship armour, countermeasures and explosive weapons, and Marsha Hicks, in the Tir system, offers upgrades in ballistic weaponry, fuel scoops, refineries and limpets. »

« These engineers represent an important stage in Colonia's continued growth. The Council hopes that pilots operating in the region will find them beneficial. »

* New Thargoid Interceptor Encountered
Independent pilots have reported engaging a previously unseen type of Thargoid vessel.

The Pilots Federation confirmed that several of its members have encountered the ship in both the Pleiades Nebula and the core systems.

Commander Jing-sheng Mendez gave this account:

« My wingmate and I were both hyperdicted while travelling through the Pleiades. We assumed that together we could handle a single Thargoid ship, but this one really soaked up our firepower. »

« I managed to get away, but Leonie didn't make it. I've already started retooling my Krait with AX weapons. I want to head back out there\u2026and get some payback. »

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, made this statement:

« We can confirm that this new ship \u2013 classified as the Hydra \u2013 is a variant of the Thargoid Interceptor. It is structurally stronger than the Cyclops, Basilisk or Medusa, and releases a larger swarm of Thargon drones. »

In response to this development, the Pilots Federation has sealed off the Cone Sector FN-J B9-0 system, which is believed to contain high concentrations of Hydra Interceptors. Despite this, it is understood that the Gnosis, flagship of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, will attempt to complete its scheduled jump into the now permit-locked system


* The Silence of Aisling Duval
The date of Princess Aisling Duval's wedding to Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester has passed without comment from either party.

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios discussed the situation:

« Public reaction to the cancelled wedding has ranged from outrage to delight. Jasmina Halsey expressed regret at a 'lost opportunity for long-term peace', while Senator Zemina Torval called it 'the mercy killing of a catastrophically bad idea'. »

« With no word from the Imperial Palace or the White House, it's easy to imagine both Emperor Arissa and President Hudson breathing sighs of relief. But the silence from Aisling Duval and Jordan Rochester rings loudest. What might they be feeling? Was their relationship terminated against their wishes? Did it ever really exist? »

« Naturally I invited the princess to tell her story, but her previous openness is apparently a thing of the past. The Rochester family is also shying away from the media. Jarl Toredo, whose alleged affair with Aisling apparently derailed the marriage, has vanished from public sight. »

« Was this a tragic love triangle, or just a political chess game? We may never know. But what's certain is that, before long, Aisling Duval will put these failures behind her and be back in the spotlight where she belongs. »


* Far God Campaign
The Thargoid-worshipping sect that reveres an entity known as the 'Far God' has issued a request for Thargoid materials.

Chancellor Reegan Tanner, speaking on behalf of LHS 2541 Alliance Combine, which is supporting the campaign, released the following statement:

« To maintain their privacy and avoid further persecution, members of the Far God sect have approached us to facilitate the collection of Thargoid materials. They have made it explicit that these materials will be revered as objects of worship, and will not be used as part of any xenobiological experiments. In the interests of religious freedom, we have decided to fulfil their request. »

In support of this campaign, LHS 2541 Alliance Combine has placed an open order for various Thargoid materials, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities to Wheelock Ring can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 30th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Conflict in Betel Ends
Authorities in the Betel system have confirmed that the conflict between the Silver Creative Network and Betel Free has come to an end.

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately there could be only one victor.

General Hollis of Betel security had this to say:

« Now this feud has been resolved, we will hopefully see a period of prolonged peace in the system. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Amphipolis in the Betel system.


* Juanita Bishop runs for Congress
Juanita Bishop, a leading campaigner against the Far God cult, has announced that she is running for Federal Congress.

Mrs Bishop's vocal condemnation of Thargoid worship has gained her a strong following in many Federal systems. She is now campaigning to be elected to Congress as an independent candidate.

At a rally protesting against the Far God sect, Mrs Bishop addressed the crowd:

« I may lack political experience, but I care about protecting decent families from alien-loving deviants. If you elect me to Congress, I will make sure our leaders rid us of the Thargoid spies undermining our great Federation! »

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune made this response:

« Juanita Bishop is building her powerbase on the fear and paranoia that she herself has invoked. As has happened before, an innocent religion is being used as a scapegoat for society's ills. »

« We should be more concerned about the fact that Far God chapters are continuing to vanish without trace. If they are under threat, it is our duty to offer protection. These people are not aliens but citizens with legal rights, despite Bishop's efforts to dehumanise them. »


* Aegis Core Relocates to Sol
In May, a criminal organisation known as the Socho Gold Raiders assumed control of the Socho system, headquarters of Aegis Core.

Since then the system has descended further into chaos, culminating in the loss of services at Dantec Enterprise due to Thargoid sensor-related interference. This in turn led to the temporary immobilisation of Aegis's Eagle Eye network, a system of orbital installations designed to determine potential Thargoid attack sites.

In the wake of this calamity, Federal President Zachary Hudson has announced that Aegis Core is to relocate from Socho to the Federal home system of Sol.

In a statement broadcast directly from the White House on Mars, Hudson said:

« Recent events in Socho have taught us that no matter the scale of the Thargoid threat, there will always be those more interested in fighting their fellow man than engaging the enemy. »

« Let me be clear: we are at war. The weakening of our defences cannot be tolerated. I have therefore agreed that Aegis Core will relocate to the Sol system, where it can be properly protected. »

« Aegis has been charged with defending humanity, and any attempt to undermine it is nothing less than an act of treason. »


* Alliance President Proposes Changes
Alliance President Gibson Kincaid has confirmed he will campaign for re-election in October.

Addressing the media, President Kincaid also said he wanted to make significant changes to the Alliance constitution:

« The role of Alliance president is largely ceremonial. I believe that should change. I have been lobbying to invest the position with executive powers, over and above the prime minister and the Assembly. By streamlining our bureaucracy, we can make decisions as efficiently as the other superpowers. »

« I also believe that each presidential incumbent should remain in office for six years, instead of a maximum of two one-year terms. That will allow time to renegotiate diplomatic relationships and correct past mistakes. »

Gibson Kincaid was the governor of the Zaonce system before assuming the presidency in 3303. He has repeatedly claimed that the Alliance is failing to fulfil its true potential.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon responded:

« Our constitution has served us well for decades and I see no reason to amend it. Its system of checks and balances exists to prevent any individual from becoming too powerful and destabilising the Alliance. »

The other presidential candidates will be announced within the next two weeks.


* Computer Designers' Rivalry Escalates
Maddox Hurd, owner of Herculean Machines, has publicly dismissed the efforts of rival company Supratech. Both companies are currently developing new computer designs.

Mr Hurd referred directly to Supratech's forthcoming product, the Torc, while addressing the media:

« There's a reason Herculean has never explored the concept of wearable devices \u2013 it's a ridiculous idea! I bet a million credits that those fragile gizmos will break, or their holograms will start glitching, the moment you turn them on. »

« If you want a reliable piece of tech, you need the Duradrive. Believe me, our device will keep on working whatever you throw at it\u2026and even if you throw it. »

When invited to comment, Supratech CEO Scorpio DeVorrow responded:

« It's regrettable that those with a clear vision of the future are often denigrated by individuals of limited imagination. We offer an elegant and revolutionary approach to personal computing \u2013 not just a rubber brick with a screen. I'm sure customers will make the intelligent choice. »

Prototypes for both the Torc and the Duradrive will be unveiled at the Rackham Ultratech Expo on Wednesday the 3rd of October.


* Week in Review

Maddox Hurd, owner of Herculean Machines, has publicly dismissed the efforts of rival company Supratech. Mr Hurd denounced the idea of wearable devices as ridiculous, prompting Supratech CEO Scorpio DeVorrow to describe him as a man of « limited imagination ».

* Scandal Hits Rochester Family
The famous actor Tomas Turai, husband of Jupiter Rochester, has been revealed to be having an extramarital affair with an Olympian athlete.

An article in The Mars Tribune stated:

« For the last three years, Tomas Turai has conducted a secret relationship with Reagan Lord, who has won several Olympic gold medals for the Altair system. Their romantic liaison took place without the knowledge of Turai's husband, Jupiter Rochester, or their two children. »

There has been no response from Jupiter Rochester. The Rochester family is currently in a media lockdown following the cancelled wedding of Ambassador Jordan Rochester and Princess Aisling Duval.

But Tomas Turai and August Lord, husband of Reagan Lord, have both announced their intention to sue The Mars Tribune for defamation. The publication's owner, billionaire Kingsley Cordova, has confirmed that he will personally cover all legal costs in contesting both civil actions.

Lana Sigrid, chief editor of The Mars Tribune, published this comment:

« We have an obligation to publish the truth wherever we find it. The detailed evidence we've obtained about Tomas Turai's behaviour is beyond dispute. We employ the finest journalists in the Federation, and our soaring subscription figures prove we've earned the public's trust. »


* Far God Campaign Concludes
LHS 2541 Alliance Combine has announced that its request for Thargoid materials for the Far God sect has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community.

Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system, and by eliminating agitators in Zavijah, thereby ensuring the safety of traders contributing to the initiative.

Chancellor Reegan Tanner, speaking on behalf of LHS 2541 Alliance Combine, released the following statement:

« We would like to thank those pilots who delivered Thargoid materials, thus contributing to the furtherance of religious freedom throughout the galaxy. At this point we would also like to address rumours that the Far God sect is experimenting on willing test subjects in the hopes of ascending to a higher form of life. We assert, in the strongest of terms, that this is baseless gossip. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system.


* Alliance Presidential Gala
The Alioth Independents has announced plans to host a gala event in the Alioth system, to officially begin the Alliance presidential election.

The event will give the as-yet unannounced presidential candidates an opportunity to meet distinguished figures from among the upper echelons of Alliance society.

Durien Ballas, chairman of Alioth Independents, issued the following statement:

« Everyone's heard of President Gibson Kincaid, but the other candidates may not be so well known. This will be their chance to shine. As well as hosting key members of the Alliance Assembly, we can also confirm that Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and three members of the Council of Admirals will be in attendance. »

To make this a truly spectacular event, the Alioth Independents have placed an open order for Esuseku Caviar, Ceremonial Heike Tea and Live Hecate Sea Worms, promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Smith Landing in the Amber system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 6th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Assembly to Vote on Proposed Changes
The Alliance Assembly has agreed to hold an internal vote on President Gibson Kincaid's proposed changes to the constitution.

Kincaid has lobbied for the role of president to be invested with executive powers, and for each presidential term to last six years.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told the media:

« After much discussion, the Assembly has agreed to vote on President Kincaid's proposals in mid-October, at the same time as the presidential election. We will announce any amendments to the constitution shortly afterwards. »

Milo Vesper, editor of The Alliance Tribune, discussed this development:

« President Kincaid's proposals are seen by some as a long-overdue restructure of the political system. Compared to the current bureaucratic procedure, having a single person make all executive decisions has an obvious appeal. But some in the Assembly are concerned that such changes could imbue the president with emperor-like levels of authority. »

« Prime Minister Mahon is playing down such fears, but the words 'constitutional crisis' have already been heard in Parliament. Whatever happens, this could be the most significant election in the Alliance's history. »


* Gnosis Stranded
A scientific-research vessel has been left stranded following a Thargoid attack.

The Gnosis, flagship of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, recently made a hyperspace jump towards the Cone Sector FN-J B9-0 system. A short time later, the following message was received from Captain Mathius Leander of the Gnosis command crew:

« We were a short way into our journey when the Gnosis was hyperdicted by a group of Thargoid vessels. The wrench back into real space caused severe internal damage to multiple systems, including the frame shift drive. »

« There's no doubt that we would have been destroyed if not for some of the Commanders travelling with us. They lured the Thargoids away while ejecting meta-alloys from their holds. The aliens were more interested in scooping up the meta-alloys than attacking us. The Commanders later reported that the Thargoid vessels were the recently identified Hydra Interceptors. »

« The Gnosis is currently adrift close to the eighth planet of the Outotz ST-I d9-6 system. We have begun essential repairs, but there is a risk that the Thargoids may return before we can escape the system. »


* Fire Destroys Supratech Facility
A manufacturing complex owned by computer company Supratech has been destroyed by fire.

All on-site personnel managed to escape the blaze without injury. Emergency crews were soon in attendance, but were unable to prevent the fire from swiftly consuming the facility.

Supratech CEO Scorpio DeVorrow made this statement:

« I regret to announce that the fire has ruined our main production complex. Dozens of prototype Torc units were also irreparably damaged. This is a severe setback in the development of our new design. »

« Investigators have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the blaze, or to explain why the fire-suppression system in our state-of-the-art complex malfunctioned so completely. Along with the security cameras, internal alarms and thermal sensors. »

Maddox Hurd, head of rival company Herculean Machines, commented:

« I'm glad to hear that everyone made it out okay. But I have to say, if Supratech's facilities are that poorly designed, I'd hate to imagine what their products are like. »

Both companies are due to unveil new personal computing devices at the Rackham Ultratech Expo in October, although it is now unclear if Supratech will take part in the trade show.


* Thargoid-Sympathiser Arrests Increase
The Federal Intelligence Agency has increased arrests of potential Thargoid sympathisers, as it continues to investigate the Far God cult.

Independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo, who first raised awareness of doomsayer cults in the core systems, has been reported missing and is assumed to have been arrested. Many others who were researching the Far God sect remain in custody, including leading exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov.

The FIA has also shut down the Galactic Interfaith Commune and apprehended its spokesperson, Dr Jameelah Griffin. Several similar organisations, including the Spiritual Freedom Movement, have been closed down.

Independent observers have confirmed that the FIA has discovered further empty Far God hive-chapels. The whereabouts of hundreds of adherents remains unknown. In an effort to uncover clues, arrests of associates and family members of Far God worshippers has intensified.

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield gave a brief statement:

« We will leave no stone unturned in our mission to identify Thargoid influences. The disappearance of Far God chapters is clearly a coordinated operation of either human or alien design. We warn anyone who may be harbouring cult members that they are impeding a Federal investigation, and will face criminal charges. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

The Alliance Assembly has agreed to vote on President Gibson Kincaid's proposed changes to the constitution. Kincaid has lobbied for the role of president to be invested with executive powers, and for each presidential term to last six years. The vote will take place in mid-October, at the same time as the presidential election.

A manufacturing complex owned by computer company Supratech has been destroyed by fire. All personnel managed to escape the blaze, but the fire has ruined the company's main production complex. Company CEO Scorpio DeVorrow expressed incredulity at the failure of the facility's fire-suppression system.

Meanwhile, the Federal Intelligence Agency has increased arrests of potential Thargoid sympathisers, as it continues to investigate the Far God cult. Independent observers have confirmed that the FIA has discovered further empty Far God hive-chapels. The whereabouts of hundreds of adherents remains unknown.

The Gnosis, flagship of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has been left stranded following a Thargoid attack. A message from the ship's command crew confirmed that the incident caused severe internal damage to multiple systems, including the frame shift drive. The Gnosis is currently adrift close to the eighth planet of the Outotz ST-I d9-6 system.

In other news, The Mars Tribune has revealed that actor Tomas Turai, husband of Jupiter Rochester, has been having an extramarital affair with Olympian athlete Reagan Lord. Tomas Turai and August Lord, husband of Reagan Lord, have both announced their intention to sue The Tribune for defamation. The publication's owner, billionaire Kingsley Cordova, has confirmed that he will cover all legal costs in contesting both civil actions.

Finally, a public appeal for Thargoid materials from the Far God sect has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Chancellor Reegan Tanner, speaking on behalf of the organising faction, said the success of the initiative was a victory for religious freedom.

And those are the main stories this week.


* The XG Project
In an interview with independent media outlet Vox Galactica, engineer Ram Tah has discussed the XG Project, which produced the recently released XG fighters.

« Ever since the first Guardian ruins were discovered, I've been trying to combine their technology with our own. I drew up a blueprint for the original fighter, the XG1, before inviting other technicians to refine the design with a view to producing something commercially viable. »

« The seventh iteration, the XG7, successfully merged human and Guardian ingenuity. The XG8 Javelin and XG9 Lance soon followed. »

When asked what the future holds, Ram Tah remarked:

« My hope is that the XG Project is merely the start of a whole new era of technological development. While the current focus is the Thargoid threat, the achievements of our galactic forebears might one day improve every aspect of society. »


* Alliance Gala Initiative Concludes
The Alioth Independents has announced that its appeal for exotic food and drink has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. Huge quantities of Esuseku Caviar, Ceremonial Heike Tea and Live Hecate Sea Worms were delivered to Smith Landing over the past week, which will now be used to host their gala event.

With the initiative at an end, Durien Ballas, chairman of the Alioth Independents, issued the following statement:

« This will be an event like no other, and we are proud to be introducing Fazia Silva and Elijah Beck to the galactic stage. Along with Gibson Kincaid, I'm sure they will soon do battle in a good-natured yet robust election campaign. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Smith Landing in the Amber system.


* Manatee Megaship Initiative
The Libertas Cooperative has announced plans to construct a manatee farm on behalf of food supplier Munshin Manatee Meat. This will take the form of a megaship, where the creatures will be bred, processed and prepared for distribution.

Progenitor Selena Conley of the Libertas Cooperative issued the following statement:

« For years, the people of Munshin have been lucky enough to dine on the finest meat in the galaxy. We are proud to be working in association with Munshin Manatee Meat to help bring their product to a much wider consumer base. »

To facilitate construction of the manatee farm, the Libertas Cooperative has placed an open order for land enrichment systems, animal monitors, aquaponic systems and marine equipment. It promises to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Ocrinox's Orbiter in the Munshin system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 13th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Calls to Execute Far God Worshippers
Juanita Bishop has called on Federal Congress to make Thargoid worship a capital crime, and for all members of the Far God cult to be executed.

Addressing a rally during her congressional campaign, Mrs Bishop stated:

« I speak for all those who live in fear of Thargoid infiltration. If elected, I will make sure this foul cult is outlawed and all its followers put to death. Congress has a duty to protect families from these alien-loving collaborators. »

Vihaan Niven, an independent political analyst, commented:

« Juanita Bishop's statement has triggered considerable debate in Congress. Some congressmen have aligned with her, eager to be seen as 'tough on Thargoids'. But others have criticised Mrs Bishop for her 'inhumane rhetoric' and for proposing the execution of Federal citizens without trial. »

« Meanwhile, the Federal Intelligence Agency continues to arrest adherents of the Far God sect and detain those who have had contact with them. As casualties from the Thargoid conflict mount, it's hard to see this most unlikely of faiths surviving much longer. »


* Candidates for Alliance Presidency Announced
The candidates in the Alliance presidential election have been announced.

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll shared the news in The Alliance Tribune:

« The candidates running against President Gibson Kincaid, who is seeking a second term, have now launched their campaigns. »

« Fazia Silva is a successful entrepreneur from the Vamm system. Although lacking political experience, she intends to leverage her business acumen to increase trade and boost economies throughout the Alliance. She has delegated control of her corporate empire to her sister, freeing her to run for office. »

« Elijah Beck, by contrast, is a highly experienced politician. Hailing from the Leesti system, he has served in the Assembly for over four decades. He is generally considered a safe pair of hands, but it's unlikely that he would bring about any significant changes as president. »

« Recent polls suggest that Kincaid, Silva and Beck are roughly equal in terms of popular support, but it's still early days. All three will vigorously campaign for support in the coming weeks, in advance of the public vote on Tuesday the 16th of October. »


* Investors Abandon Herculean Machines
An anonymous source has revealed that Maddox Hurd, owner of technology company Herculean Machines, was previously investigated by the Federal Security Service.

The source shared recently declassified FSS records on the Rewired news channel, and stated:

« When establishing Herculean five years ago, Maddox Hurd accepted financial contributions from individuals connected to organised-crime networks, such as the Red Family. While Hurd did not technically break the law, the FSS has kept a close eye on him ever since. »

In the wake of this news, a number of Herculean Machines' corporate investors withdrew their support. Maddox Hurd told the media:

« This is a smear campaign, and those underhanded snakes at Supratech are behind it! »

Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of rival company Supratech, declined to comment, but Harlow Nassry, technology journalist at The Federal Times, observed:

« With Herculean Machines losing investment and Supratech's facility destroyed, both companies are in a compromised position. Unless they can drum up additional support, neither will be able to unveil their new designs at the Rackham Ultratech Expo in October. »

* Manatee Megaship Initiative Concludes
The Libertas Cooperative has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. Land enrichment systems, animal monitors, aquaponic systems and marine equipment were delivered to Ocrinox's Orbiter over the past week, allowing construction of a megaship where manatees will be farmed.

With the initiative at an end, Progenitor Selena Conley of the Libertas Cooperative issued the following statement:

« The people of Munshin, and our partners at Munshin Manatee Meat, extend the warmest of thanks to all pilots who supported our project. Increased production of manatee meat will give a much-needed boost to the Munshin system's economy. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Ocrinox's Orbiter in the Munshin system.


* Appeal for Computing Commodities
Two rival technology companies \u2013 Supratech and Herculean Machines \u2013 have appealed for commodities to support the release of forthcoming products.

Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of Supratech, issued the following statement:

« The Torc is the latest in personal computing, featuring state-of-the-art holographic technology. Anyone who wants to benefit from the next generation in wearable hardware should support its development. »

Meanwhile, Maddox Hurd, head of Herculean Machines, had this to say:

« The Duradrive cannot be rivalled for power or customisability. What people need in this challenging age is a robust product, not some ephemeral toy that malfunctions when exposed to a stiff breeze. »

To bring their products to market, both companies have placed open orders for commodities. Supratech requires Conductive Fabrics, Robotics and Microcontrollers, while Herculean Machines has asked for Consumer Technology, Hardware Diagnostic Sensors and Computer Components. Pilots wishing to support Supratech should deliver commodities to Roberts Port in the Fedmich system, while pilots wishing to support Herculean Machines should deliver commodities to Cowper Dock in the Anima system.

The campaigns begin on the 20th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If either party achieves its aims earlier than planned, both campaigns will end immediately.


* Robot Exposes Corporate Fraud
Business magnate Lloyd Hardacre has been arrested for corporate fraud after his personal administrative robot revealed incriminating evidence.

The incident occurred at Burnell Station during the annual general meeting of Copernicus Shipping Ltd, an interplanetary haulage firm founded by Mr Hardacre.

One witness, a company shareholder, told reporters:

« Halfway through Hardacre's financial presentation, we saw off-the-books logs that were very obviously illegal. Hardacre ordered the robot to stop, but it continued projecting data from its internal drives. Eventually he ran from the hall in panic. »

Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne of the Federal Security Service made this statement:

« We have placed Mr Hardacre in custody while we verify multiple instances of fraud and misuse of company funds. We are also investigating how his personal admin robot managed to obtain such information, and why it chose to make the data public at this time. »


* Historical Sculptures Stolen
A collection of historically significant artworks has been stolen from the Imperial Museum of Culture on Eotienses A 3.

A local media report stated:

« The museum's most popular exhibit is the New Dawn Collection, a sequence of sculptures by legendary artist Lal Candromir. These figures date back nearly a thousand years and commemorate the early settlers of Eotienses agreeing to join the Empire. »

« This morning, visitors found the entire exhibit empty, with every single one of the Candromir statues gone. Painted onto the wall was a graphic of a winking cat. The museum cannot explain how its security systems were so completely circumvented. »

Captain Madoc Evander of the Imperial Internal Security Service commented:

« We are performing forensic analyses and interviewing all staff and visitors. As yet, we cannot confirm any connection between this theft and one that occurred three months ago in the Alioth system, despite the identical 'winking cat' motif. We will make every effort to capture this criminal and recover these precious cultural artefacts. »


* Inside the Far God Cult
Independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo, who was previously thought missing, has revealed that he has been living undercover within the Far God cult for the past three months.

In an op-ed piece, Mr Okonkwo shared his experiences:

« I was fascinated by Dr Ulyanov's research and I desperately wanted to understand this doomsayer cult further, so I decided to covertly study the Far God sect by posing as an adherent. »

« During this time, I visited hive-chapels in several different systems, narrowly escaping death when one was attacked by the Church of Eternal Void. On many occasions, I was physically and verbally abused by members of the public, including Juanita Bishop's campaign followers. »

« At no point did I see evidence of actual contact with the Thargoids, bar the occasional use of alien material as holy artefacts. Most worshippers are essentially fatalists, attracted to the idea of an apocalypse. Some are convinced that they alone will survive the Far God's manifestation. It is a strange and often contradictory faith, but no less so than other religions. »

« I recorded my experiences within the sect using concealed micro-cameras. I am voluntarily sharing this data with the Federal Intelligence Agency to prove that the Far God sect is not dangerous, and with the hope of ending its persecution. »


* The Presidential Power Struggle
With the Alliance presidential race gathering speed, political journalist Vanya Driscoll has published an analysis in The Alliance Tribune:

« The election of a new president is usually a ceremonial matter, during which voters select a public 'face' for the Alliance, but this year is a genuine power struggle \u2013 one that may have major consequences. »

« Elijah Beck is the only candidate who seems content with the status quo. By contrast, entrepreneur Fazia Silva promises to boost the economy and increase commerce. Her new financial policies have been welcomed by interstellar corporations and small businesses alike. »

« President Gibson Kincaid is causing the most controversy, however. His proposal that the role of president should include executive powers is being taken seriously by the Assembly. Kincaid claims that having a single controlling voice will enable the Alliance to 'challenge our rivals' dominance'. »

« There is a surprising amount of support for this combative rhetoric. Many agree that the Alliance could be stronger, and that Prime Minister Mahon is often hamstrung by bureaucracy. Rumours suggest that the Empire and Federation are watching this election far more closely than usual. »

* Oktoberfest in Bhagui
Citizens of the Bhagui system are attempting to resurrect the ancient Oktoberfest celebration, an annual event based on a centuries-old Earth tradition.

The scale of the event is unprecedented, and local suppliers are reeling due to the weight of demand. Consequently, Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has volunteered to finance an emergency initiative that will supply the required resources.

A spokesperson for the company issued the following statement:

« This will be a party like no other, where people can come together to celebrate life, love and beer. We are honoured to play our part in supporting a festival such as this. Nothing is more important to us than helping our communities. »

Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has placed an open order for animal meat, fish and beer, promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Leavitt Port in the Bhagui system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing to the initiative can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 27th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Commodities Appeal Concludes
The competing campaigns from technology companies Supratech and Herculean Machines have come to an end. Huge quantities of technological components were contributed to the initiatives, which will be used to support the manufacture of new personal computers.

As the Supratech campaign drew to an end, company CEO Scorpio DeVorrow issued the following statement:

« I can't thank the galactic community enough for its support. We believe the Torc is something really special, and due to the support we've had we can begin manufacture at once. »

His business rival Maddox Hurd, CEO of Herculean Machines, had this to say:

« We've received an awe-inspiring response, proving that pilots everywhere want technology that can stand the test of time. »

Pilots who contributed commodities to Supratech can collect their rewards from Roberts Port in the Fedmich system, while pilots who contributed commodities to Herculean Machines can collect their rewards from Cowper Dock in the Anima system.


* Presidential Candidates on the Campaign Trail
The three candidates for the Alliance presidency have spent much of the past week delivering their campaign messages.

Incumbent president Gibson Kincaid, who seeks re-election, has demanded radical change to the constitution:

« To occupy the same league as the other superpowers, we need a single ruler with overall control. I ask that you empower me to lead the Alliance into a new era of strength and unity. That is my vision. »

An increase in commerce is the focus for entrepreneur Fazia Silva:

« The current president is driven entirely by ego, as are all career politicians, but it's money that makes the galaxy go round. Only by investing in trade and industry can the Alliance truly grow. »

Councillor Elijah Beck has been critical of his rivals' approach:

« President Kincaid has little respect for our values, and Ms Silva wants to make it easier for her companies to increase profits. The Alliance deserves a president who puts the wellbeing of its people first, rather than their own selfish goals. »

The new president of the Alliance will be announced in October.


* Robot Surveillance Program Discovered
The personal administration robot of business magnate Lloyd Hardacre, which recently revealed evidence of his criminal activity, has been found to contain a concealed surveillance program.

Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne of the Federal Security Service made a statement to the media:

« FSS technicians discovered a highly sophisticated surveillance program within the robot's coreware that was covertly copying certain types of data \u2013 namely anything illegal. A minor malfunction caused the robot to incorporate the data into a company presentation. »

« Our working theory is that Mr Hardacre was the target of an undercover spy operation, but not one coordinated by any legal authority. Clearly, someone harboured suspicions about Hardacre and was looking for proof. We are conducting interviews with his business associates and competitors. »

When asked about the robot, Lieutenant Inspector Thorne added:

« The robot is manufactured by the Achilles Corporation, and is a relatively primitive machine, designed to coordinate information and perform administrative tasks. Such robots are incapable of independent behaviour, so this one must have been subjected to comprehensive reprogramming. »


* Computer Companies Resume Development
Rival companies Herculean Machines and Supratech have resumed development of their new personal computers.

Harlow Nassry, technology journalist at The Federal Times, has been following events:

« After the mysterious fire that destroyed Supratech's factory and the equally mysterious scandal that scared off Herculean Machines's investors, it seemed like neither company would complete its new designs. »

« But successful requests for public support have turned that around. Maddox Hurd and Scorpio DeVorrow, the heads of Herculean and Supratech respectively, both received enough materials to produce functional prototypes for the Rackham Ultratech Expo on Wednesday the 3rd of October. »

« This expo is crucial for both companies. Rackham Capital Investments and other corporate sponsors will be paying close attention, and Zachary Rackham himself will be present, eager to get his hands on the latest gadgets. »

« Both the customisable Duradrive and the wearable Torc have captured the public imagination, but the prototypes' performance is key. The amount of commodities each company received might be the deciding factor in their commercial success. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

The three candidates for the Alliance presidency have spent much of the past week delivering their campaign messages. While incumbent president Gibson Kincaid has demanded radical change to the constitution, rival candidates Fazia Silva and Elijah Beck have adopted more conservative stances, focusing on economic growth and civil liberty respectively. The new president of the Alliance will be announced in October.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has terminated its investigation into the Far God cult. In a statement, the FIA confirmed that information provided by undercover reporter Gethin Okonkwo had cleared the sect of any suspicion. All worshippers who were detained have now been released.

In other news, rival companies Herculean Machines and Supratech have resumed development of their new personal computers, following successful requests for public support.

* Far God Cult Investigation Ends
The Federal Intelligence Agency has terminated its investigation into the Far God cult.

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield informed the media:

« The information provided by Gethin Okonkwo on the inner workings of the Far God sect has been verified as genuine. In the absence of any evidence regarding communication with the Thargoids, our investigation is concluded. All worshippers who were detained have now been released. »

« We are indebted to Mr Okonkwo for his highly detailed report. We had hoped to gain similar insights via our own undercover agent, who infiltrated the sect, but we are still awaiting his report. »

The exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov, who was arrested due to his research into the religion, commented:

« I offer the highest praise to Gethin Okonkwo, whose dedication has confirmed the innocuous nature of the Far God faith. Sadly, this experience illustrates that intolerance and fear of the 'other' remain deeply embedded in human nature, no matter how advanced our species becomes. »


* Oktoberfest Supply Campaign Successful
Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has confirmed that its appeal for commodities to supply an Oktoberfest celebration in the Bhagui system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community.

Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Leavitt Port, and by protecting traders in the Bhagui system.

A spokesperson for Mould Federal Mining Incorporated issued the following statement:

« Thanks to so many generous pilots, Bhagui Oktoberfest will now go ahead. Revellers will be able to put aside their differences, forget their troubles and celebrate life. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Leavitt Port in the Bhagui system.


* Broadcast Cobra Initiative
Media organisation Broadcast Cobra has announced its intention to build a megaship in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation, which specialises in politics and current events, aims to reach a much wider audience with the construction of this mobile studio.

Alessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:

« As a broadcaster, we like the idea of a ship that can carry our signal to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. A megaship will allow us to transmit to systems that other broadcasters can only dream of reaching. »

To facilitate construction of the megaship, Broadcast Cobra has placed an open order for thorium, indium and superconductors, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Sopwith Dock in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 4th of October 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Bishop's Congressional Bid Collapses
Juanita Bishop, whose protest movement against the Far God cult gained broad support, has failed to be elected to Federal Congress.

Independent political analyst Vaughan Niven published this summary:

« Many of Juanita Bishop's followers have abandoned her in the wake of Gethin Okonkwo's investigation, which found no connection between the Far God sect and the Thargoids. As a result, Mrs Bishop's congressional campaign has collapsed. »

« There has also been a sea change in attitude within Congress itself. The majority of members have now taken a stand against Mrs Bishop for cultivating civil unrest and violating the Federation's principles of religious freedom. »

Juanita Bishop gave a forceful statement to the media:

« If Congress can't see that these people are dangerous, then they're fools. These Thargoid spies need to be rounded up and executed before they murder us all. History will prove me right! »


* Further Surveillance Robots Discovered
The Federal Security Service has discovered more administration robots fitted with secret surveillance programs.

Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne informed the media:

« Our investigation into Lloyd Hardacre's admin robot, which secretly recorded evidence of corporate fraud, has broadened significantly. Acting on reports of unusual behaviour, we have found five further robots containing hidden surveillance programs. »

« In each case, the robot was a PA912 model, manufactured by the Achilles Corporation. The robots' owners are now helping us with our enquiries. »

Two of the five owners have been identified. Don Zhao is the CEO of Kuiper Mining Inc., while Anya Blackriver runs a public-relations consultancy with offices in Olympus Village, San Francisco and Columbus station.

A spokesperson for the Achilles Corporation gave this statement:

« We are cooperating with the FSS investigation, and would like to reassure the public that our robots are as trustworthy as ever. This illegal surveillance has nothing whatsoever to do with the Achilles Corporation. »

Over the last decade, the Achilles Corporation has sold over 20 million robots throughout the Federation, including nearly 300,000 PA912 models.


* Herculean Machines Dominates Expo
Technology journalist Harlow Nassry has published a full account of the Rackham Ultratech Expo, which took place on Wednesday 3rd October.

« All eyes were on Herculean Machines and Supratech, whose competing designs for personal computers have created a real buzz. Following lavish presentations from rival CEOs Maddox Hurd and Scorpio DeVorrow, prototypes of the Duradrive and Torc were given to attendees. »

« Unfortunately for Supratech, the Torc's holographic systems did not work as planned. Most users were surrounded by an incomprehensible aura of colours and images that, in some cases, brought on nausea. The Duradrive, by contrast, functioned perfectly. »

« The highlight of the expo came when Zachary Rackham tested a Duradrive by jumping on it, before using it to contact his chief accountant and authorise preliminary funding for the device. He told the crowd, 'I could have done with one of these back in my spacefaring days!' »

« It's clear that the support given to Herculean Machines by the galactic community has allowed them to deliver a superior product \u2013 one we can expect to see on the market soon. »


* Presidential Candidate Murdered
Fazia Silva, one of the three candidates in the Alliance presidential race, has been found dead. She is believed to have been murdered.

Inspector Erin Sangster of Alliance Interpol informed the media:

« Ms Silva's body was found in a room at Hume Orbital, where she was staying during her presidential campaign. Medical teams detected traces of poison, making this a suspected homicide. »

There has already been speculation that this was a political killing, motivated by Silva's proposed changes to Alliance financial policy. The entrepreneur also had fierce rivals in the business world.

Her sister Tashmira Silva, who has been overseeing the Silva corporate empire, stated:

« Our family is devastated \u2013 we can't believe that Fazia has been taken from us. I will honour her by continuing to run the companies that she made so successful. »

Condolences have been delivered by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and both of Ms Silva's election rivals, Gibson Kincaid and Elijah Beck. President Kincaid said:

« This tragedy constitutes a direct attack on our democracy. The Alliance's enemies will do anything they can to destabilise us, including murder. If we are to fight back, we will need strong leadership. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Fazia Silva, one of the three candidates in the Alliance presidential race, has been found dead. There has been speculation that the murder was a political killing, motivated by Silva's proposed changes to Alliance financial policy. Condolences have been delivered by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and both of Ms Silva's election rivals, Gibson Kincaid and Elijah Beck.

Technology company Herculean Machines dominated the recent Rackham Ultratech Expo, which took place on Wednesday 3rd October. Billionaire Zachary Rackham was delighted with Herculean's Duradrive, and agreed to authorise preliminary funding for the device. The Torc, a rival product from Supratech, had a less successful showing.

In other news, the Federal Security Service has discovered more administration robots fitted with secret surveillance programs. In each case, the robot was a PA912 model, manufactured by the Achilles Corporation. The company has announced that it is cooperating with the FSS investigation.

Juanita Bishop has failed to be elected to Federal Congress. Many of Bishop's followers have abandoned her in the wake of Gethin Okonkwo's investigation, which found no connection between the Far God sect and the Thargoids, while Congress members have taken a stand against Mrs Bishop for cultivating civil unrest.

Meanwhile, media organisation Broadcast Cobra has announced its intention to build a megaship in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation, which specialises in politics and current events, aims to reach a wider audience with the construction of this mobile studio, and has placed an open order for materials to facilitate construction.

Finally, Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has confirmed that its appeal for commodities to supply an Oktoberfest celebration in the Bhagui system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Leavitt Port, and by protecting traders in the Bhagui system.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Survivors of the Far God
Independent journalist Gethin Okonkwo has shared more details about his time with the Far God cult:

« After three months of living as a Far God worshipper, I'm now acclimatising to life as an ordinary citizen. There, I was known only as Third Witness of the Tenth Chapter, although that was more of a title than a name. Identical in our robes, we were all nameless servants of the commune. »

« That may sound despotic, but there was a strangely seductive aspect to surrendering one's identity. At times I almost experienced the tranquillity that true adherents seemed to feel. »

« I'm relieved to see Far God believers returning to their hive-chapels, having survived weeks of persecution. This has been a baptism of fire for the sect, with hundreds dead and several chapters still missing. »

« Many other doomsayer cults have since faded away or, like the Church of Eternal Void, been outlawed. But it seems that the Far God faith will endure, perhaps even beyond our conflict with the Thargoids. »

« I have been contacted by the exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov with a view to combining our research. Together we hope to produce the definitive account of this tenacious religion. »


* Broadcast Cobra Initiative Concludes
Broadcast Cobra has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community.

Vast quantities of thorium, indium and superconductors were delivered to Sopwith Dock over the past week. These will allow construction of a megaship from which the organisation will broadcast its take on current events.

Alessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:

« We'd like to thank everyone who supported this campaign. We hope that wherever you are, you're always listening. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Sopwith Dock in the HIP 16038 system.


* Close Encounters Corps Initiative
The Close Encounters Corps has announced its intention to construct a scientific megaship in the BD-12 1172 system. The new vessel will allow research teams to map and explore the planets of the surrounding nebula.

Admiral Anton Vern of the Close Encounters Corps issued the following statement:

\A number of survey groups have expressed interest in mapping the nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. This new scientific vessel will act as a base from which they can research the abundance of unexplored planets throughout the nebula.\

To facilitate construction of the megaship, the Close Encounters Corps has placed an open order for muon imagers, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Crown Prospect in the Kagutsuchi system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 11th of October 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Increased Fear of Spy Robots
The Federal Security Service has discovered more personal administration robots containing concealed surveillance programs.

Independent reporter Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse discussed the situation on the Rewired news feed:

« In recent weeks, hundreds of individuals and businesses have destroyed their personal robots. Mass robophobia? Or paranoia that the robots might be secretly recording them? Makes you wonder what these people are trying to hide\u2026 »

« How many millions of robots are spying on us right now? And for what purpose? Is it a coincidence that all the affected models are made by the Achilles Corporation? Maybe blackmailing the rich is their new revenue stream. »


* Duradrive Enters Production
Technology company Herculean Machines has begun mass production of its new device, the Duradrive personal computer.

Following the successful performance of its prototype at the Rackham Ultratech Expo, the company has received corporate funding from a range of sources, including Rackham Capital Investments.

Maddox Hurd, CEO of Herculean Machines, told the media:

« As I've said before, what people want is a reliable tool that is tough enough to handle anything. I'd like to once again thank the galactic community for providing the commodities that made our success possible. »

There has been no comment from rival CEO Scorpio DeVorrow.


* Presidential Candidates Make Final Pledges
The two remaining candidates in the Alliance presidential race have returned to the Alioth system to make their final campaign vows.

In the parliamentary chamber of the Assembly, Elijah Beck addressed his fellow council members:

« The Alliance occupies a unique position, and as such must remain true to its principles. My focus as president will be on attracting more independent systems to our interstellar family. »

He was followed by the current incumbent, President Gibson Kincaid:

« Fazia Silva's assassination was an assault on our democracy. The Alliance's enemies are growing bold, and we must do the same. I beseech the Assembly to imbue the presidential role with executive powers, to transform our Alliance into a true superpower capable of challenging its adversaries. »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon thanked both candidates and wished them good luck in the election.

The public vote will take place on Tuesday the 16th of October and the results will be announced later that week.


* Week in Review

* Kincaid Wins Election
Gibson Kincaid has been announced as the winner of the Alliance presidential election. He will continue serving as president of the Alliance.

Kincaid obtained a small majority of the public vote, defeating Councillor Elijah Beck. Entrepreneur Fazia Silva, the third candidate in the race, was recently found dead, and is the subject of an Interpol investigation.

President Kincaid addressed his followers at a victory rally:

« My thanks go to every citizen who saw the wisdom of my vision. I vow to lead you into a glorious future! »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon gave a statement to the media:

« I offer my congratulations to President Kincaid on being successfully re-elected. The Assembly is continuing to debate his proposal to imbue the presidential role with executive powers. We have agreed to extend the deadline by one week, after which a parliamentary vote will decide the outcome. »


* Close Encounters Corps Initiative Concludes
The Close Encounters Corps has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community.

A huge number of muon imagers were delivered to Crown Prospect over the past week. These will allow the construction of a scientific megaship to research the nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system.

With the initiative at an end, Admiral Anton Vern of the Close Encounters Corps issued the following statement:

« I am grateful for the professionalism displayed by the pilots who took part in this project, and thank them on behalf of our researchers. New horizons and new worlds await us. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Crown Prospect in the Kagutsuchi system.


* Palin Institute Campaign
The Palin Institute has announced an accelerated programme of study to analyse a range of xenobiological data, and perhaps discern the motives behind the Thargoids' unrelenting aggression.

Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, released the following statement:

« In recent months, the Institute has performed countless studies on alien technology and physiology, and our stock of xenobiological samples is severely depleted. For this robust new study, we require a large amount of Thargoid material to support a wide range of experiments. »

The Ryder Revolutionary Party, which is supporting the campaign, has placed an open order for various Thargoid materials and promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering materials to Ryder Revolutionary Party can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 18th of October 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Rackham Hacked
Billionaire businessman Zachary Rackham has been targeted by a highly sophisticated hack that successfully withdrew 1 billion credits from his personal account.

A spokesperson for Rackham Capital Investments informed shareholders:

« We have reported the theft to the authorities, and are reviewing our computer security systems. The only clue as to the criminals' identity is a message they left encoded in Mr Rackham's account: 'The Collective plays to win.' »

Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:

« The purpose of the hack was evidently to reclaim the billion-credit prize that Rackham 'won' in the Federal Grand Lottery. What Rackham Capital Investments didn't reveal was that the money was redistributed equally among several hundred of the company's former employees, who were denied their company pensions years ago. »

« There is a sweet irony to the old pirate Calico Zack having his money stolen by cyber pirates. Whoever the Collective might be, they seem to have both a sense of justice and a sense of humour. »


* Raid on Phoenix Base
An attempt by armed intruders to access Phoenix Base in the Meene system has been foiled. The base is the home of engineer Ram Tah.

Security Chief Harper Vargas gave this report:

« Defensive systems alerted us to a small group of intruders who had breached the base's perimeter. Our teams engaged them in combat and forced them back to a waiting ship. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the ship or prevent it from escaping. »

« During the incursion, the intruders used explosives to sabotage the base's power network. Fortunately, the base remains operational.\

Ram Tah told the media:

« I believe this was an attempt to steal research data or samples of Guardian technology \u2013 the implications of which are most disturbing. Although the attempt failed, it has disrupted my important research. »

Gibson Kincaid has been announced as the winner of the Alliance presidential election, and will continue serving as president of the Alliance. Kincaid obtained a small majority of the public vote, defeating Councillor Elijah Beck. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon said the Alliance Assembly was still debating Kincaid's proposal to imbue the presidential role with executive powers.

An attempt by armed intruders to access Phoenix Base in the Meene system, home of the engineer Ram Tah, has been foiled. Ram Tah said he believed the thwarted raid was an attempt to steal research data or samples of Guardian technology.

In other news, the Federal Security Service has targeted The Mars Tribune as part of its investigation into robots carrying concealed surveillance programs. The development follows news that several of those found to be in possession of 'spy' robots were the subject of incriminating articles published by the Tribune. The conglomerate that owns The Mars Tribune has challenged any suggestion of wrongdoing.

* Mars Tribune Linked to Spy Robots
The Federal Security Service has targeted The Mars Tribune as part of its investigation into robots carrying concealed surveillance programs.

Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne made this statement:

« The personal robots of former congressman Morgan Unwin and actor Tomas Turai were found to contain surveillance programs. In recent weeks, both were the subject of incriminating articles published exclusively in The Mars Tribune. »

« Public-relations guru Anya Blackriver, also the owner of a 'spy' robot, was recently exposed by the Tribune for concealing various scandals on behalf of her celebrity clients. In fact, all the owners of affected robots live in the Sol system, which is the focus of the Tribune's journalism. »

« We are therefore interviewing Tribune staff to establish if they used these robots to gather private data in order to obtain material for exclusive stories. »

Legal representatives of the Cordova Group, the conglomerate that owns The Mars Tribune, have challenged the FSS for making 'libellous and baseless accusations'.


* The Collective
Technology journalist Harlow Nassry has published an article in The Federal Times regarding a mysterious criminal group known only as 'the Collective':

« Several recent digital crimes, including the theft of a billion credits from Zachary Rackham, have now been attributed to the Collective. Security forces have launched investigations, but it seems that the name is already well known among hacker communities. »

« The Collective is a group of anti-authority 'hacktivists' who believe that all information should be publicly available. It has existed for some years, but until recently its activities have been small scale. »

« Nobody knows the identity of the group's members, which has no spokespersons or apparent leaders. As anarchists, they delight in flouting the law, believing that all data should be in the public domain \u2013 except, of course, data about themselves. »

« Some see the Collective as irresponsible criminals, while others paint them as modern-day Robin Hoods. Either way, as possibly the best hackers in the galaxy, it's likely we'll be hearing more about them in the future. »


* Mars Tribune Refutes Allegations
As the Federal Security Service continues its investigation into The Mars Tribune for illegally obtaining the private information of Federal citizens, the newsfeed's parent company, the Cordova Group, has filed a formal complaint.

The FSS has established that the administration robots of dozens of public figures and wealthy individuals have been fitted with hidden surveillance programs, and that these programs may be the source of several scandals exposed, exclusively, by The Mars Tribune.

Kingsley Cordova, billionaire owner of The Mars Tribune, addressed the situation in an editorial:

« These accusations are an insult to our journalistic integrity. Are we to be punished for uncovering liars and criminals? Our readers have always been grateful to us for shining a light into Sol's murky corners. »

« I suggest that the FSS treads more cautiously. These robots apparently have access to very sensitive data. Imagine if they publicly broadcasted everything they'd learned about their owners. »


* Alliance Assembly Revises Presidential Role
The Alliance Assembly has concluded its debate over President Gibson Kincaid's request for executive powers.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon announced the decision:

« The Assembly has voted that President Kincaid's proposed changes to the constitution will not be adopted, and no executive powers will be granted. »

« There was broad agreement, however, that the role should be updated, which has resulted in the creation of a new non-political department: the Office of the Alliance President. »

« The president will now oversee a team of ambassadorial emissaries who will focus on diplomatic functions. This will free up council members, allowing them to govern more effectively. The presidential term has also been extended to three years. »

President Kincaid told the media:

« I regret that the Assembly cannot see how the Alliance would be strengthened by an empowered president, but I must respect their decision, and promise to put my new team of emissaries to good use. »


* Sirius Corp Makes Public Offer
The Sirius Corporation has publicly offered to work with engineer Ram Tah in the development of further Guardian-human technology.

Li Yong-Rui, the corporation's chief executive officer, made this statement:

« Ram Tah's research into the Guardians is of central importance to humanity's future, and I would therefore like to place the resources of the Sirius Corporation at his disposal. »

« As the recent incident at Phoenix Base illustrates, Ram Tah's operation is currently at risk. Not only can we guarantee his safety, but with our manufacturing capabilities we can bring the benefits of Guardian technology to the whole galaxy. »

There has been a range of reactions from business analysts. Some have advised Ram Tah to take advantage of the offer to mass-produce his designs, while others have warned that Sirius Corp is seeking a monopoly over Guardian-human technology.

As yet there has been no response from Ram Tah. Repairs to his base in the Meene system have been completed, following an attempted incursion by armed intruders.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

The Alliance Assembly has decided not to adopt President Gibson Kincaid's proposed changes to the constitution, and has ruled against imbuing the role of president with executive powers. The Assembly has agreed to update the role, however, with the creation of a new non-political department known as the Office of the Alliance President. The presidential term has also been extended to three years.

Meanwhile, as the Federal Security Service continues its investigation into The Mars Tribune, the newsfeed's parent company, the Cordova Group, has filed a formal complaint. Kingsley Cordova, billionaire owner of The Mars Tribune, said the accusations were an insult to the publication's integrity.

Imperial Senator Caspian Leopold has launched an appeal to help those affected by Thargoid attacks. While the senator's rehabilitation centre has helped hundreds of thousands of refugees, it seems further aid is needed to avert a humanitarian crisis.

Finally, the Palin Institute's appeal for Thargoid materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Professor Cora Shaw thanked those who supported the institute's latest scientific initiative, which will aim to advance understanding of the Thargoids.

And those are the main stories this week.


* No Leads in Fazia Silva Case
The investigation into the death of Alliance presidential candidate Fazia Silva has concluded. No convictions have been made.

Inspector Erin Sangster of Alliance Interpol made this statement:

« The death of Fazia Silva has been officially ruled as homicide. The use of a sophisticated nerve toxin and the circumvention of security at Hume Orbital suggests the involvement of one or more professional assassins. »

« Unfortunately, we have now exhausted all possible avenues of investigation, and are left with no option but to consider the case closed. »

President Gibson Kincaid told the media:

« I have no doubt that the murder of Ms Silva was designed to disrupt our democracy, and I will not rest until the Alliance's enemies pay for their crimes. »

Tashmira Silva has now assumed permanent control of her late sister's corporate empire.


* Conflict in Geras
Recent reports from the Geras system indicate that after a spate of reciprocal attacks, hostilities between Geras First and Ndozins State Inc have escalated into all-out war.

According to Donal Varden, an independent journalist:

« For several months we've seen these factions sniping at one another from the shadows, but now the stakes have been raised. It won't be long before the space lanes of Geras are littered with the burned-out shells of dead ships. »

The warring organisations have issued calls to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.

Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 1st of November 3304.


* Appeal for Aid Complete
Senator Caspian Leopold has announced that his appeal for aid, in association with the Niflhel Guardians Of Tradition, has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Biruni Port, and by protecting traders in the Niflhel system.

A spokesperson for Senator Leopold made the following statement:

« Thanks to the work of many brave pilots, a humanitarian crisis has been narrowly averted. Senator Leopold has expressed his gratitude to all those who contributed to the campaign, and has assured refugees at his rehabilitation centre that new homes will be found for each and every one of them. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Biruni Port in the Niflhel system.


* The Rise of Nova Imperium
A radical group called Nova Imperium is gaining influence throughout the Empire.

Imperial Herald journalist Cassia Carvalho highlighted the situation:

« Nova Imperium claims that to survive the Thargoid conflict, the Empire must sever contact with all other systems and concentrate on protecting itself. In recent months, the organisation has become a genuine political force. »

« The group's leader is known only as the Imperator. Dressed in an Imperial Navy uniform, he is a charismatic presence who speaks of 'a return to the honour of the old days' and 'the glory of Achenar'. »

« Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the Imperator's rhetoric. On several worlds, Nova Imperium's followers hold rallies with a distinctly martial feel. »

« So far there has been little response from Imperial authorities, but it is clear that Nova Imperium will soon become impossible to ignore. »


* Ram Tah Rejects Sirius Corp
The engineer Ram Tah has rejected an offer from the Sirius Corporation to support the manufacture of Guardian-human technology.

In a public statement, he said:

« These technologies, developed using principles discovered by the Guardians, are too important to become corporate products. I have no doubt that Sirius would aim for maximum profits, rather than using the knowledge to aid humanity. »

« Using tech brokers to distribute the designs allows them to be widely available, and thanks to the generosity of Aegis, the tech brokers' costs have been reduced, making Guardian-human fighters and systems more affordable. »

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, has stated that his offer remains open, and that he hopes Ram Tah will have a change of heart.


* Spy Robot Investigation Redirected
The Federal Security Service has abruptly terminated its investigation of The Mars Tribune regarding personal administration robots fitted with hidden surveillance programs.

Although interviews with Tribune employees were underway, it has been alleged that a senior figure in the FSS ordered the task force to focus elsewhere.

The Tribune's owner, billionaire Kingsley Cordova, stated:

« I'm pleased that our innocence has been accepted, and I'm confident that the guilty parties will soon be found. »

An opinion piece in The Federal Times from chief editor Lena Ravenhill took an alternative view, however:

« Last week, Cordova suggested the spy robots could share the many secrets they've gathered, and suddenly the FSS is ordered to leave The Mars Tribune alone. Does anyone really think this is coincidence? How many powerful people are frightened of what Cordova might reveal about them? »

* Mercenary Incursion in Meene
A mercenary group has been intercepted by security forces in the Meene system.

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force reported:

« Six hours ago, our forces were attacked by a small fleet belonging to a known mercenary group. Fortunately, we were able to defeat them before they could do serious damage. »

« There is no doubt that the mercenaries' primary target was Phoenix Base. We suspect that this incident is connected to an attempted raid on the base that was repelled a few weeks ago. »

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, addressed the incident:

« I'm relieved that the attack was foiled, but this only demonstrates how precarious Ram Tah's situation is. I urge him to accept my offer to work with the Sirius Corporation \u2013 not only for his own safety, but also to safeguard future Guardian-human technologies. »


* Conflict in Geras Ends
Authorities in the Geras system have confirmed that the conflict between Geras First and Ndozins State Inc has come to an end.

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but in the end there could be only one victor.

Independent journalist Donal Varden offered an analysis:

« After a week of furious fighting, the Geras system is now eerily quiet. Ultimately only one side could be victorious, but this uneasy peace has come at a great and dreadful cost. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Yurchikhin Port in the Geras system.


* Recover Escape Pods in Meene
Following a skirmish with a group of mercenaries, security forces in the Meene system have launched an operation to capture enemy agents in order to investigate the attack.

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force gave the following statement:

« The mercenaries were targeting Ram Tah's Phoenix Base, but it's clear they were just hired hands. We need to recover as many surviving mercenaries as we can and interrogate them, so we can find the real culprits. »

The Independent HIP 29241 Green Party, which is overseeing the initiative, has asked pilots to recover both occupied and damaged escape pods, and to deliver them to Felice Dock in the Meene system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing to the recovery can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 8th of November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* FSS Agent Suspended
Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne, who has been leading an investigation into The Mars Tribune, has been suspended from the Federal Security Service.

A spokesperson for the FSS released the following statement:

« We have suspended Lieutenant Inspector Thorne from active duty, effective immediately. His investigation is officially terminated. »

The announcement came less than an hour after Thorne made the following public appeal:

« We have evidence that the admin robots fitted with surveillance programs are connected to exclusive stories obtained by The Mars Tribune. Since my superiors are unwilling to pursue this, I am appealing to anyone with relevant information to come forward. I can guarantee them immunity from prosecution. »

Many media including Lena Ravenhill, chief editor of The Federal Times, reacted with outrage to the news:

« It's clear that someone in the FSS is feeling threatened, and that The Mars Tribune has used spy robots to feed the scandals it thrives on. We are highlighting Ramesh Thorne's appeal, as are many other newsfeeds taking a stand against corrupt journalism. »


* A Warning from the Imperator
The isolationist group Nova Imperium has broadcast a message to Imperial citizens via public media.

The organisation's leader, known only as the Imperator, said:

« Imperial citizens, your ruler's weakness has put you in great danger. If we are to survive the Thargoid onslaught, we must sever ties with the Federation and other, inferior powers, and concentrate on protecting our own systems. »

« I call upon those who care about their Imperial birthright to support Nova Imperium. We vow to restore the Empire's purity and strength, and to lead it into a glorious future. »

Senator Denton Patreus responded with the following comment:

« These extremists and their seditious agenda are not worthy of attention. So far we have been lenient with them, but this so-called Imperator would be wise not to test our patience any further. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A mercenary group has been intercepted by security forces in the Meene system. It is understood that the mercenaries' primary target was Phoenix Base, home of the engineer Ram Tah. Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, said the attack demonstrated the precariousness of Ram Tah's situation.

In related news, security forces in Meene are launching an operation to capture enemy agents. Security Chief Harper Vargas said his forces intended to detain any surviving mercenaries and interrogate them, so they could identify the individuals behind the incursion.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne, who has been leading an investigation into The Mars Tribune, has been suspended from the Federal Security Service. The news came less than an hour after Thorne made a public appeal for information regarding admin robots fitted with secret surveillance programs, citing the unwillingness of his superiors to pursue the matter.

The isolationist group Nova Imperium has broadcast a message to Imperial citizens. The organisation's leader, known only as the Imperator, implicitly criticised Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval for 'weakness', and said that the Empire would only survive the Thargoid onslaught by severing ties with the other superpowers.

The family and colleagues of author Olav Redcourt have reported him missing. A police investigation has so far failed to determine his whereabouts. Redcourt recently hit the headlines when he terminated his relationship with his publisher, Bonespire Publishing, midway through a promotional tour.

Finally, authorities in the Geras system have confirmed that the conflict between Geras First and Ndozins State Inc has come to an end. Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but in the end there could be only one victor.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Famous Author Missing
The family and colleagues of author Olav Redcourt have reported him missing. A police investigation has so far failed to determine his whereabouts.

Redcourt recently hit the headlines when he terminated his relationship with his publisher, Bonespire Publishing, midway through a promotional tour.

In the wake of the author's disappearance, Bonespire released the following statement:

« We can only assume that Mr Redcourt is trying to avoid paying his fine for contract violation, which runs to several million credits. Of course, should he agree to continue writing the bestselling Corsair King series, we would be happy to waive the damages. »

Literary critic Kayla Shah offered an alternative explanation:

« Obsessive readers of the Corsair King series have sent death threats to Redcourt for not delivering exactly what they wanted. Now that he's turned his back on the series, might he have been kidnapped by a rabid fan and forced to write more novels, or even murdered as an act of revenge? »


* Report on Nova Imperium Leaked
A report compiled by the Imperial Internal Security Service on isolationist group Nova Imperium has been leaked.

The Rewired news service broadcast the report in full:

« This document compiles our latest intelligence on Nova Imperium, as requested. Although the group has not yet committed any crimes, its threat potential should not be underestimated. Its isolationist message resonates with those fearful of Thargoid invasion, and its rallying cry of 'Empire for the Imperials' aligns with the more conservative citizenry. »

« We have identified the group's leader, the Imperator, as Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, a former naval admiral from a long line of decorated veterans. »

« Evidence suggests that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy. Nova Imperium's ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews, bound by loyalty to their former commanding officer. »

« We will continue to monitor Nova Imperium and report on any developments. »


* Olelbis Holdings Appeal
Olelbis Holdings, an organisation based in the Olelbis system, has announced an elaborate social function at Polyakov Orbital, the faction's base of operations.

In support of this event, Olelbis Holdings has placed an open order for quantities of Deuringas Truffles, Mokojing Beast Feast and Mulachi Giant Fungus, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Polyakov Orbital in the Olelbis system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.

The campaign begins on the 15th November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Escape Pod Recovery Complete
The Independent HIP 29241 Green Party has announced that its appeal to recover escape pods has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering pods to Felice Dock, and by protecting contributing ships in the Meene system.

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force gave the following statement:

« We have recovered a number of key figures within the mercenary group, and interrogations are underway. We will share more information when we have it. »

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.


* Cordova Group Linked to Spy Robots
The Federal Times has revealed a connection between the Cordova Group and the spy robots scandal.

Chief Editor Lena Ravenhill wrote:

« Ramesh Thorne's recent appeal elicited a response from an anonymous whistle-blower \u2013 a robotics engineer employed by the Achilles Corporation who helped design the robots at the heart of these events. »

« The engineer has attested that she was blackmailed by Kingsley Cordova, owner of the Mars Tribune, into installing surveillance programs on robots belonging to well-known people in the Sol system. The accumulated data was relayed to the Cordova Group, which published it in The Mars Tribune. »

A spokesperson for the Achilles Corporation said:

« The engineer has provided us with a 'kill switch' that remotely deletes the spy program she designed. This coreware update has now been transmitted to all PA912 model robots. We can therefore assure our customers that there is no longer any risk of their private information being misused. »


* Connection to Sirius Corp Uncovered
A link has been established between the mercenary group recently intercepted in the Meene system and the Sirius Corporation.

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force said:

« With the vital assistance of the galactic community, we were able to apprehend several of the mercenaries. Interrogations revealed that a number of them were in fact junior officers in Sirius Corp's private fleet. »

« Other mercenaries confirmed that the attack was funded and organised by these individuals, which raises the question of why Sirius should be involved with this criminal enterprise. »

The engineer Ram Tah, who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, commented:

« Did Sirius really think it could obtain my research by force? Or was this an attempt to scare me into accepting Li Yong-Rui's offer? »

A spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation refuted any allegations of criminal activity, and insisted there would be a full inquiry.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A leaked Imperial Internal Security Service report on Nova Imperium has revealed that the group's leader is one Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, a former naval admiral from a long line of decorated veterans. The report reveals that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy, and that Nova Imperium's ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews.

Meanwhile, an Achilles Corporation engineer who helped design the robots at the heart of the spy robot scandal has given evidence to former FSS inspector Ramesh Thorne. The engineer claims she was blackmailed by Kingsley Cordova, owner of the Mars Tribune, into installing surveillance programs on PA912 administration robots. All the affected robots have now been made safe.

In other news, the Independent HIP 29241 Green Party operation to recover escape pods in the Meene system has reached a successful conclusion. The captured mercenaries were interrogated by the Meene Defence Force, leading to the realisation that several of them were junior officers in Sirius Corp's private fleet. The engineer Ram Tah, who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, has claimed that Sirius is trying to obtain his research by force. The Sirius Corporation has refuted any allegations of criminal activity.

Finally, Olelbis Holdings, an organisation based in the Olelbis system, has announced an elaborate social function at Polyakov Orbital, the faction's base of operations. In support of this event, Olelbis Holdings has placed an open order for various rare commodities, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Polyakov Orbital in the Olelbis system.

Popular author Olav Redcourt, who was recently reported missing, has been found alive and well at a writers' retreat at a remote outpost. The writer is apparently hard at work on his new book, a science fiction novel.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Olav Redcourt Found
Popular author Olav Redcourt, who was recently reported missing, has been found alive and well.

Margot Hist of the Dervish-Foss Literary Agency told the media:

« I can reassure Olav's fans that he is in good health, and has checked into a writers' retreat at a remote outpost. I can also reassure Bonespire Publishing that he will soon pay their fees for contractual breach, having sold most of his belongings. »

« Olav is currently hard at work on his new science fiction novel, despite my attempts to convince him to choose a more popular genre. »

When asked why these facts were not made public sooner, Ms Hist replied:

« Unfortunately I didn't know there was concern about Olav's whereabouts until I returned from holiday \u2013 there are no communication facilities at Skyglow Havens on the Rhea Archipelago. »


* New Appointment to Council of Admirals
Admiral Frederick Yamamoto has been announced as the sixth member of the Alliance Council of Admirals.

The position had been vacant for months after the previous appointment, Riri McAllister, was discovered to be the coordinator of terrorist group the League of Reparation.

The induction ceremony was conducted by Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin, who said:

« After many years commanding the Alliance Defence Force in the Zaonce system, Admiral Yamamoto has more than earned his place on the Council. His experience will help enhance security for all member systems. »

Vanya Driscoll, political journalist at The Alliance Tribune, commented:

« Many expected the role to be filled by an officer from the Lave fleet rather than Zaonce, so the decision has ruffled some feathers. It has also not gone unnoticed that Admiral Yamamoto is a close personal friend of President Gibson Kincaid. »


* Hostilities Erupt in Loha System
A long-standing rivalry between two factions in the Loha system has erupted into full-scale conflict.

The commencement of hostilities was announced on the Vox Galactica news service by Karleen Troy, a freelance warzone reporter:

« Relations were already strained when Loha Holdings accused its rivals of hijacking transport ships and murdering their crews. After the New Loha Party claimed this was a false flag operation designed to discredit them, diplomacy was rapidly replaced by weapons fire. »

« Since neither side has an extensive fleet, both Loha Holdings and the New Loha Party have appealed for support. I've received word that they're offering substantial rewards to independent combat pilots who can aid them in this conflict. »

The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 22nd of November 3304.


* Olelbis Holdings Appeal Concludes
A spokesperson for Olelbis Holdings has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering goods to Polyakov Orbital, and by eliminating agitators in Olelbis, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Polyakov Orbital in the Olelbis system.


* Mars Tribune Closes
The Mars Tribune has been closed and its owner arrested in the wake of the spy robot scandal.

The announcement was made by Detective Captain Ramesh Thorne, who was recently reinstated to, and promoted by, the Federal Security Service:

« Kingsley Cordova, editor Lana Sigrid and other employees of The Mars Tribune have been arrested for blackmail and corruption. The newsfeed has been permanently dissolved, and the Cordova Group conglomerate subjected to a government audit. »

« I would like to thank the anonymous whistle-blower who exposed Cordova's scheme. She has now removed the surveillance program from all Achilles Corporation PA912 robots in exchange for immunity from prosecution. »

Chief Editor Lena Ravenhill wrote in The Federal Times:

« The Mars Tribune abandoned its professional ethics in its hunt for salacious headlines, thereby undermining the role of honest journalism in our society. We are relieved to see justice done. »


* Sirius Arrests Rogue Officers
The Sirius Corporation has responded to the revelation that members of its private fleet coordinated a mercenary raid on the Meene system.

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corp, told the media:

« Following a thorough inquiry, we have confirmed that a cabal of junior officers, with the aid of mercenaries, orchestrated an illegal operation to gain access to Phoenix Base. Although their intentions remain unclear, I can confirm they were acting purely in their own interests, and without official knowledge. »

« The rogue officers, including those extradited into our custody by the Meene Defence Force, now face multiple charges, and could be imprisoned for life. »

« I would like to express my sincere regret over this incident, and to personally apologise to Ram Tah. I continue to hope that we can work together on further Guardian-human technology. »

Isolationist group Nova Imperium has declared its intention to install a new Emperor. The group's leader, recently identified as ex-navy admiral Duke Kaeso Mordanticus and known as the Imperator, said that the superpower had been weakened by collaborating with its enemies, and that the new Emperor would restore the glory of the Empire.

* Nova Imperium Demands New Emperor
Isolationist group Nova Imperium has declared its intention to install a new Emperor.

The group's leader, recently identified as ex-navy admiral Duke Kaeso Mordanticus and known as the Imperator, said:

« The Empire has been weakened by collaborating with its enemies. Aegis drains our resources to protect foreign systems from the Thargoids, our security forces are stretched thin defending non-Imperial systems, and Princess Duval sullies her honourable name by dallying with a Federal libertine. »

« Our people demand stronger leadership. We will achieve this by installing a new Emperor \u2013 one who will restore the glory of the Empire! »

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented in The Imperial Herald:

« Naturally there has been no response from Arissa Lavigny-Duval. But for many citizens, Mordanticus has articulated their unease about inter-superpower cooperation. With support for Nova Imperium increasing rapidly, a silent minority may now have found a voice. »


* Ulyanov Discusses Far God Outposts
Exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov has commented on the abandoned Far God outposts recently discovered in the Etain system:

« This fascinating discovery implies that the missing chapters of the Far God sect were not arrested or killed, but instead fled to secret outposts to avoid persecution. »

« According to personal logs recovered from the sites, the sect's members planned to wait in suspended animation for the coming of the Far God. The logs also reveal surprising details about what motivated these individuals to devote themselves to the faith. »

« Evidence suggests that the settlements on Etain 4a and 4c both came under attack, but whether by Thargoids or human forces is unclear. Mysteriously, no trace remains of the inhabitants. »

« I am indebted to the explorers who discovered these sites. This information will significantly contribute to the book I am co-writing with Gethin Okonkwo about the Far God religion. »


* Hostilities in Loha Conclude
The conflict between two rival factions in the Loha system has now come to an end.

Karleen Troy, freelance warzone reporter, delivered a report for the Vox Galactica news service:

« This has been a harrowing week for the people of Loha. In that time, I've witnessed acts of brutality and heroism from both sides. But now that their resources are exhausted, overall control of the system has finally been established. »

« For those pilots who took advantage of the conflict, this will have been a profitable exercise. Both factions have announced that pilots can now collect their rewards from Whitworth Station in the Loha system. »


* Achilles Corp Initiative
The Achilles Corporation has announced plans to replace all robots destroyed as a result of the recent spy robot scandal.

Chairman Gus Weaver of the Sol division of Achilles Corp said:

« We take customer support seriously. That's why we're offering to replace \u2013 free of charge \u2013 any robots destroyed or damaged by owners who suspected them of behaving inappropriately. »

« To achieve this, we've asked the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond to organise deliveries of robotics, computer components and microcontrollers to Henslow Market in the Adenets system. These will be used to produce brand new PA912 administration robots and other models. »

« The Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond  has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities can do so safely.

The initiative begins on the 29th of November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Thargoid-Sensor Disruption Neutralised
Aegis has announced a breakthrough that has effectively neutralised the disruptive effects of Thargoid Sensors on starports.

Henrik de Lacerda, a senior engineer at Aegis Research, told the media:

« As we know, Thargoid Sensors can cripple starports for weeks or months at a time, but recent advancements in our study of meta-alloys have resulted in an effective cure for what was once called 'the technological plague'. »

« New procedures in the application of meta-alloys mean that extremely small quantities are now sufficient to shield systems from disruption. »

« Following this breakthrough, we have made arrangements to ship meta-alloys to all affected stations, to restore them to functionality. It will not be long before every starport in known space is immune to Thargoid Sensor\u2013related interference. »


* Aegis Offers Security to Ram Tah
Aegis has stationed a security force in the Meene system to protect the engineer Ram Tah.

An announcement was made by Professor Alba Tesreau:

« Ram Tah's research has been enormously beneficial to our understanding of the Thargoids, and resulted in developments that aid us in the conflict. We therefore have a vested interest in protecting his work. »

« We have deployed a security force that will provide continual support while allowing Ram Tah's operation to remain completely independent. Hopefully this will prevent any further disruption. »

There has been no response from the Sirius Corporation, which recently arrested a cabal of junior officers from its private fleet for launching an incursion into Meene. Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of Sirius Corp, has allegedly withdrawn his offer to work with Ram Tah on Guardian-human technology.

* Senators Support Nova Imperium
Several Imperial senators have spoken in support of isolationist group Nova Imperium.

Senator Pal Vespasian made the following statement:

« Many of us see Nova Imperium not as extremists, but as realists. The citizenry is afraid of both Thargoid invasion and of being weakened by collaboration with foreign systems. They look to the Emperor for salvation\u2026and she offers them none. »

« We intend to invite Imperator Mordanticus to address the Senate and detail his policies. This is a historic opportunity to restore the Empire's honour and integrity. »

« Furthermore, Nova Imperium's proposal to install a new Emperor has my full backing. »


* Merger Creates Mega-Corporation
Two eminent corporations have merged to form one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the galaxy.

Allied Medical Industries, based in Alliance space, has united with Neosalve Inc., a conglomerate that supplies medicines to a great many independent systems.

The new mega-corporation, Neomedical Industries, will sell a drugs, equipment and services to both Alliance and independent systems.

The merger was closely monitored by the Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO), an official inter-superpower body that regulates developments in medical science.

In the pharmaceutical arena, only the Vandermeer Corporation, which supplies medicines exclusively within Federal territory, is of a comparable size to the newly formed Neomedical Industries.


* Cult Requests Rare Commodities
An obscure cult based in the Zlota system has requested a range of rare items for an arcane ceremony.

A handwritten statement from Barnabas Cole, leader of a group named the Children of Tothos, was submitted to the media:

« This is the rite that will unmask us and allow us to see the path \u2013 the path we will all take, together, toward freedom. »

Zlota Federal Holdings, which is thought to have some connection to the cult, has requested Aganippe Rush, Motrona Experience Jelly and Onion Head to be delivered to Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system. It has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to protect those delivering these rare commodities.

The initiative begins on the 6th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Achilles Corp Initiative Concludes
A goodwill initiative from the Achilles Corporation has now concluded.

Chairman Gus Weaver of the Sol division of Achilles Corp announced:

« Thanks to the dedication of many independent traders, we have now acquired enough commodities to manufacture replacements for all robots destroyed in the wake of the spy robot scandal. »

« I'd also like to remind our customers that the illegal surveillance program was safely deleted by our latest coreware update. Remember, you can always trust Achilles. »

The deliveries were organised by the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond, which also arranged to protect traders from attack. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Henslow Market in the Adenets system.


* New Nanomedicine Announced
Independent company Vitadyne Labs has developed an innovative new form of nanomedicine.

Professor Katrien Rook published the following press release:

« Nanomeds are sophisticated pharmaceuticals that use nanoscale materials to repair cell damage on a molecular level. They can heal any injury in a fraction of the normal time, and can potentially cure almost any disease and infection. »

« Furthermore, regular use of nanomeds affects cellular senescence, drastically slowing the ageing process. In theory, nanomed users will live between 30 and 50 years longer, and will enjoy near-perfect health during those extra decades. »

« After months of trials we are inviting medical authorities, including the Interstellar Health Organisation, to review our data. Pending approval, we hope to have Vitadyne nanomeds on the market soon. »


* Nova Imperium Unveils Figurehead
Isolationist group Nova Imperium has revealed its choice for Emperor \u2013 an eighteen year old man named Hadrian Augustus Duval.

The group's leader, Imperator Mordanticus, broadcast this message:

« It is incumbent upon me to reveal that Hengist Duval fathered not one but two illegitimate children in his younger days. A few years before meeting Florence Lavigny, he had a brief affair with a slave in the Imperial household. When Hengist's father discovered this, the matter was hushed up and the slave dismissed. The slave's son went on to sire a child of his own: Hadrian Duval, grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval. Hadrian was unaware of this until we located him and genetically confirmed his lineage. »

« Arissa Lavigny-Duval is a weak Emperor who must be removed. We call for Hadrian Duval to be recognised as the true heir to the throne! »

The Imperial Herald's political journalist Cassia Carvalho observed:

« This announcement has shaken the Empire to its very foundations. Having Hadrian as a figurehead has rallied those hardliners more comfortable with the idea of a male Emperor. With a single stroke, Nova Imperium has gained considerable credibility and massively increased its support. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

Two corporations have merged to form one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the galaxy. Allied Medical Industries has united with Neosalve Inc. to create Neomedical Industries, which will sell drugs, equipment and services to both Alliance and independent systems.

Independent company Vitadyne Labs has developed new pharmaceuticals that use nanoscale materials to repair cell damage on a molecular level. The company claims the nanomeds can heal injury in a fraction of the normal time, and even slow the ageing process. The Interstellar Health Organisation is reviewing the new medicines.

Nova Imperium has revealed its choice for Emperor \u2013 an eighteen year old man named Hadrian Augustus Duval. The group claims that Duval is the grandson of former emperor Hengist Duval, and that he has a legitimate claim to the Imperial throne. The group's leader, Imperator Mordanticus, has called for Hadrian to replace Arissa Lavigny-Duval.

Journalist Gethin Okonkwo has commented on the Far God outposts found in the Etain system, saying that the logs recovered from the outposts illustrated how the faith attracted people from varied backgrounds. Okonkwo also said that the book he is writing with Dr Alfred Ulyanov would reveal much about the Far God religion.

An obscure cult based in the Zlota system has requested a range of rare items for an arcane ceremony. A handwritten statement from Barnabas Cole, leader of a group named the Children of Tothos, elaborated on the nature of the ceremony. Zlota Federal Holdings, which is thought to have some connection to the cult, is overseeing the initiative.

Finally, a goodwill initiative from the Achilles Corporation has concluded. Chairman Gus Weaver of Achilles confirmed that the company had acquired enough commodities to manufacture replacements for the robots destroyed in the wake of the spy robot scandal. He also reminded consumers that the surveillance program at the heart of the scandal was safely deleted by the company's latest coreware update.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Mysteries of the Far God
Journalist Gethin Okonkwo has discussed the abandoned Far God cult outposts in the Etain system:

« During my months undercover as a Far God worshipper, I heard only whispered rumours about secret outposts. So the existence of two such settlements, on Etain 4a and 4c, proves that much remained hidden from me. »

« The personal logs recovered from the outposts illustrate how the faith attracted people from varied backgrounds. I was astonished to hear the voice of a man with whom I once eagerly discussed the Far God's arrival, never realising that he was a Federal agent whose devotion was as fake as my own. »

« The book I am co-writing with Dr Alfred Ulyanov will reveal much about the Far God religion, but it's clear that many of its mysteries are yet to be uncovered. »


* Mamba and Krait Phantom Released
Two new ships marketed towards independent pilots, the Mamba and the Krait Phantom, have just hit the market.

Zorgon Peterson issued the following press release for its new vessel:

« If it's speed and firepower you want, the Mamba is for you. Based on a racing prototype, it's the fastest commercially available starship, and it sports enough hardpoints for a range of devastating weaponry. Whether you're leaving competitors in the dust or running rings around those pesky Thargoids, think Mamba! »

Faulcon DeLacy also released a statement for its latest design:

« The Krait Phantom offers true multi-role capability, allowing it to be customised for combat, mining or trading. And for explorers, its impressive jump range means you really can reach out to the stars. This is a ship that can handle it all. »


* Introducing the Codex
A new networked database system named the Codex has been released to the galactic community.

The Codex is a joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographics, which issued the following joint statement:

« We are pleased to announce that the Codex has been automatically uploaded to the onboard systems of all vessels registered with the Pilots Federation. »

« The Commander section of the Codex collates all ship data, including the pilot's personal achievements, while the Knowledge Base contains information on the galaxy's most prominent organisations and individuals. »

« The Discoveries section is designed to support deep-space exploration. As well as cataloguing stellar bodies and other phenomena, it also logs confirmed and unconfirmed findings from fellow explorers. »

« We hope the Codex will prove valuable to all Commanders, and we look forward to it being updated with their findings. »


* Children of Tothos Initiative Concludes
An initiative to deliver rare commodities to an esoteric cult in the Zlota system has concluded.

Independent traders provided Aganippe Rush, Motrona Experience Jelly and Onion Head for a ceremony to be performed by the Children of Tothos. Other pilots protected the rare goods from being taken by pirates.

Barnabas Cole, leader of the Children of Tothos, gave another handwritten message to the media:

« By helping us, you free yourselves. You will feel the light of our testament fill you, just as it fills the heavens. »

The initiative was organised by Zlota Federal Holdings, which allegedly counts some high-ranking officials as cult members. Contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.


* Battle Commences in Wally Bei System
Conflict has erupted between two opposing factions in the Wally Bei system.

Hostilities were triggered after Wally Bei Technical claimed to have discovered stolen food shipments aboard their rival's transport vessels. The faction's spokesperson said:

« Robbing innocent people of vital supplies is nothing less than an act of war, and we are treating it as such. »

This was denied in an official response by Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party :

« This outrageous accusation is intended to drive off our trade partners and damage our economy. We won't tolerate such slander! »

Military leaders from both Wally Bei Technical and the Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party have issued calls to independent combat pilots, offering rewards for their support.

The two factions have set out week-long operations that will begin on the 13th of December 3304.


* Hadrian Duval Addresses the Empire
Hadrian Augustus Duval, the long-lost grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval, has broadcast a message to the Empire:

« I am no wealthy senator from an entitled family, but someone who has lived an ordinary life. Someone who understands the hardships faced by many Imperial citizens. »

« As Hadrian Jansen, I was a poor child with no family other than my father. Together we scraped a living as independent traders. He never spoke of his past \u2013 not even when he died two years ago. That was when I inherited his ship and became a Commander myself. »

« When Imperator Mordanticus informed me of my heritage, I knew I had to accept my identity as a Duval. I've seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed. »

« I ask you to honour the legacy of the Duval bloodline. With Nova Imperium, let's save the Empire we love. »


* Positive Response to Vitadyne Nanomeds
The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) has delivered a preliminary report on the nanomedicines recently developed by Vitadyne Labs. The summary stated:

« Nanomedicine is a carefully regulated branch of medical science, with little scope for public application, but Vitadyne's nanomeds are more sophisticated and reliable than any existing product. Furthermore, Vitadyne's data regarding healing, disease treatment and extension of longevity has been verified. »

« Having confirmed the product's effectiveness, IHO teams are now conducting independent tests with patients. »

Media outlet Vox Galactica published this viewpoint from healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey:

« The pharmaceutical industry is astonished that a small company like Vitadyne could produce something so advanced. Professor Katrien Rook's credentials are impeccable, of course, but this is a work of genius. These nanomeds could be the most exciting thing in medicine for decades. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's major stories.

A new networked system named the Codex has been released to the galactic community.

The Codex is a joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographics, which announced that the system had been automatically uploaded to all vessels registered with the Pilots Federation.

Two new ships marketed towards independent pilots have been released. The Mamba, from Zorgon Petersen, is reputedly one of the fastest ships in production, while the Krait Phantom, manufactured by Faulcon DeLacy, has been envisaged as a multi-role vessel.

Hadrian Augustus Duval, the long-lost grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval, has broadcast a message to the Empire in which he emphasised his humble background and stressed that he had lived an ordinary life. He concluded with the words: « I've seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed. »

Meanwhile, the Interstellar Health Organisation has delivered a preliminary report on the nanomedicines recently developed by Vitadyne Labs. The report states that Vitadyne's nanomeds are more sophisticated and reliable than any existing product, and that Vitadyne's data regarding healing, disease treatment and extension of longevity has been verified.

In other news, conflict has erupted between two factions in the Wally Bei system. Hostilities were triggered after the Wally Bei Technical claimed to have discovered stolen food shipments aboard their rival's transport vessels. This was denied in an official response by Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party. Military leaders from both factions have issued calls to independent combat pilots, offering rewards for their support.

Finally, an initiative to deliver rare commodities to an esoteric cult in the Zlota system has concluded. Barnabas Cole, leader of the Children of Tothos, submitted a handwritten message to the media that read: « By helping us, you free yourselves. You will feel the light of our testament fill you, just as it fills the heavens. »

And those are the main stories this week.


* Call to Ban Far God Book
Disgraced politician Juanita Bishop has called for a forthcoming book about the Far God sect to be banned:

« The authors, Ulyanov and Okonkwo, are known alien sympathisers. One was arrested as a suspected traitor and the other has admitted to being a Far God cultist! »

« What they're writing is nothing more than pro-Thargoid propaganda. It is an insult to all the brave souls who died trying to keep us safe. The authorities need to prevent this book from contaminating innocent people with its repulsive ideas. »

Journalist Gethin Okonkwo, who spent months undercover in the Far God sect, responded:

« The book includes first-hand accounts of worshippers being attacked by Bishop's followers. Her desperation to halt its publication is nothing more than an attempt to prevent a criminal investigation into her activities. »


* Supplies Needed for Imperial Festivities
Imperial senator Simone Leatrix has announced plans for a week of revelry at her palatial residence on Capitol in the Achenar system.

The senator told the media:

« We Imperials value the finer things, even during times of political upset. So I intend to celebrate the end of the year with a sumptuous party at my mountaintop retreat, which will be specially renovated for the occasion. »

To feed the hundreds of high-profile guests and decorate the senator's residence, Senator Leatrix has asked the Cemiess Imperial Society to organise deliveries of food and newly refined jewels to Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system.

The initiatives begin on the 20th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If either initiative meets its targets earlier than planned, that campaign will end immediately.


* Battle Ceases in Wally Bei System
The conflict between two opposing factions in the Wally Bei system has ended. The fleets of both Wally Bei Technical and the Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party  were significantly reduced in a prolonged series of battles.

The leaders of both organisations issued a joint statement:

« We recognise that our military leaders overreacted to accusations made by both parties. For humanitarian reasons, we have agreed to bring hostilities to an end. But we will honour the commitment made by independent pilots on both sides, who are now authorised to collect their rewards from the Wally Bei system. »


* New Mining Tools Released
A range of new asteroid-mining equipment is expected to trigger an increase in the availability of ores and minerals.

A spokesperson for the Industrial Mining Guild discussed the new tools at an industry symposium:

« Using mining lasers to remove surface deposits from asteroids can be difficult. The new abrasion blaster fires projectiles that break them free more easily. »

« For deeper deposits, sub-surface displacement missiles can penetrate the rock and then be detonated remotely, releasing larger chunks of material. »

« Finally, there is now a way to access valuable resources deep within certain rare bodies. Seismic charges, when carefully positioned, can crack an asteroid open and free the minerals at its core. »

« Combined with upgrades to existing tools, such as scanners and prospector limpets, we are confident that these new tools will result in a surge in private mining activity. »


* Aisling Duval Rejects Nova Imperium
Princess Aisling Duval has publicly rejected the isolationist group Nova Imperium and its figurehead, Hadrian Duval:

« These extremists cause only division. Hadrian may well be the grandson of Hengist Duval, but that hardly makes him suited to the throne. Arissa has been silent for too long \u2013 she must act quickly to resolve this volatile situation. »

Senator Zemina Torval responded:

« Much to my surprise, I find myself in agreement with Princess Duval. The notion of an independent pilot becoming ruler of the Empire is preposterous. I am confident that the Emperor will respond accordingly. »

Despite this united front, Senator Pal Vespasian stated:

« Many senators are willing to recognise Hadrian Duval as Emperor-in-waiting. Nova Imperium is now a legitimate political movement with several million supporters. The only way the Empire will survive is by accepting the Imperator's proposals. »


* Nanomed Trials Successful
Clinical trials for new nanomedicines developed by Vitadyne Labs have delivered outstanding results.

Observers from the Interstellar Health Organisation summarised:

« Our teams carefully monitored the use of Vitadyne nanomeds on patients for whom conventional treatments were unsuitable. In all cases, the nanomedicines eliminated malignant cells, boosted immune systems and repaired damaged tissue. »

« There is no doubt that this product represents a breakthrough in nanomedicine, with enormous healthcare potential. »

Professor Katrien Rook, owner of Vitadyne Labs, told the media:

« It's highly gratifying to have our work validated in this way. I'm grateful to the IHO for its diligence, and I look forward to introducing our nanomedicines to the galaxy. »

* Isolde Rochester becomes Shadow Vice President
Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters has appointed Isolde Rochester as the deputy leader of the Federation's Liberal Party.

The new Shadow Vice President made a statement to the media:

« After a decade of serving in Congress, supporting both President Halsey and Shadow President Winters, it is an honour to accept this position. Many challenges face the Federation, and the Liberal Party is ready to meet them. »

The former deputy leader, Edgar Santiago, recently made the sudden decision to retire from politics and purchase a private luxury starship, despite not being known for extravagant spending.

Isolde Rochester is the matriarch of the powerful Rochester family, which includes the CEO of Core Dynamics and two Federal Navy officers. Rumours suggest that she called off the wedding of her son Ambasador Jordan Rochester when suggestions arose of Princess Aisling Duval's infidelity.


* Herculean Machines Initiative
The Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal computers from manufacturer Herculean Machines.

Maddox Hurd, the company's CEO, made this announcement:

« It's a testament to the Duradrive's reliability that the Federal Navy wants to make it standard issue, and we are proud to supply them. »

« Fulfilling this order on time requires additional materials, however, so we urgently need deliveries of consumer technology, hardware diagnostic sensors and computer components to Boltzmann Hub in the Blatrimpe system. »

« The campaign is being coordinated by our partner, the Blatrimpe Allied Co Commodities, which has placed a kill order on all wanted ships to keep traders safe. I haven't ruled out the possibility that our rivals might recruit agitators to disrupt this operation \u2013 who knows what Scorpio DeVorrow is up to these days? »

The initiative begins on the 27th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Festive Imperial Campaigns End
Initiatives to supply Imperial senator Simone Leatrix's festivities have reached a conclusion.

Mass deliveries of food and jewels took place in the Cemiess system.

As the campaigns drew to a close, Senator Leatrix made this statement:

« My gratitude goes to those who helped make this celebration possible. I hope the sight of my glittering mountaintop retreat serves as an inspiration in these times of civil disquiet. »

Traders who supported the initiative can now collect their rewards from Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system.


* An Heir to the Imperial Throne?
Imperial senators supporting the isolationist group Nova Imperium have demanded that Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval acknowledge its figurehead, Hadrian Augustus Duval.

Senator Eloise Winterstone proclaimed to the Senate:

« The Imperial family must officially recognise Hadrian Duval as one of its own. Given that the Emperor has no children, such an act would secure the future of the Duval bloodline. »

Chancellor Anders Blaine replied:

« Our official position is that Nova Imperium is a fringe organisation with no right to determine policy. We have no more to say on the matter. »

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho wrote in The Imperial Herald:

« With the possibility of civil war increasing, the suggestion that Arissa accept Hengist Duval's grandson as an heir feels like a reasonable compromise. Her lack of response so far has led to accusations of weakness, with many calling on her to step down and for Hadrian Duval to be instated as sovereign ruler. »


* Antal Levels Accusation at Vitadyne
Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, has made a statement regarding the new nanomedicines developed by Vitadyne Labs:

« The nanomedicines that Professor Katrien Rook claims to have created were in fact developed in Utopia, and have been in use for decades. »

« Several months ago, a medical transport disappeared after departing from the Polevnic system. Our assumption is that the ship was attacked and its cargo stolen. Evidently, Professor Rook acquired Utopian technology and is now passing it off as her own creation. »

« These nanomedicines were never intended for use outside of Utopia. Such sophisticated materials can only be controlled by Utopian engineers. We demand that our property be returned to us immediately. »

There has been no response from Vitadyne Labs. The Interstellar Health Organisation has said that it will investigate Pranav Antal's accusation.


* Alliance and Federation React to Nova Imperium
The leaders of the Alliance and the Federation have commented on the rise of the isolationist group Nova Imperium.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told the Alliance Assembly:

« The civil unrest in the Empire is an internal matter, but it would be a major concern if it resulted in a policy change regarding inter-superpower cooperation. We are therefore watching the situation closely. »

In Congress, President Zachary Hudson said:

« If Nova Imperium comes to power and the Empire ceases contributions to Aegis, our combined defences against the Thargoid threat will be jeopardised. In such a case, the Federation would be forced to intervene in order to safeguard humanity's future. »

Independent sources have confirmed that Federal Navy resupplies have increased in frequency. Fleet manoeuvres have also taken place in regions bordering Imperial territory.

In other news, Simguru Pranav Antal has claimed that the nanomedicines developed by Vitadyne Labs were in fact developed in Utopia. In a statement, Simguru said the nanomedicines were never intended for use outside of Utopia, and demanded their immediate return.

The leaders of the Alliance and the Federation have commented on the rise of Nova Imperium. Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon said the unrest afflicting the Empire would be a concern if it affected inter-superpower cooperation, while Federal President Zachary Hudson said the Federation would be forced to intervene if Nova Imperium came to power and the Empire ceased contributions to Aegis.

Meanwhile, the Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal computers from manufacturer Herculean Machines. Maddox Hurd, the company's CEO, said the request was a testament to the Duradrive's reliability. Herculean has placed an open order for various commodities to fulfil the request.

Finally, twin initiatives to supply Imperial senator Simone Leatrix's festivities have reached a successful conclusion. As the campaigns drew to a close, Senator Leatrix said she hoped the sight of her glittering mountaintop retreat would serve as an inspiration amid the current civil disquiet.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Theft Ruins New Year Celebration
The theft of a spectacular work of art has soured New Year festivities for thousands of Federal citizens.

Kioko McGrath, culture correspondent for The Federal Times, reported:

« A colossal holo-sculpture was due to be unveiled at midnight to mark the start of 3305. Inspired by the Federal insignia, the intention was for the sculpture to be visible above Olympus Village, and seen by millions of people. »

« But upon activation, the image that materialised was a gigantic cat's face, winking repeatedly. The original holo-sculpture code was later discovered to have vanished. »

The Federal Security Service believes the culprit to be the same art thief who stole valuable works on Alioth and Eotienses A 3, both of which were marked with an identical 'winking cat' motif.

There are no leads at present.


* Herculean Machines Initiative Concludes
An initiative run by Herculean Machines, manufacturer of Duradrive personal computers, has now concluded.

Multiple shipments of consumer technology, hardware diagnostic sensors and computer components were delivered to the Blatrimpe system, which will be used to fulfil a large order from the Federal Navy.

Maddox Hurd, the company's CEO, made this statement:

« Once again, I offer my thanks to the galactic community for its support. We're very pleased to become a supplier to the Federal Navy, and we hope that the Duradrive remains in production for a long, long time. »

Pilots who took part in the initiative can now collect their rewards from Boltzmann Hub in the Blatrimpe system.


* Supplies for Federal and Imperial Navies
An open order for military supplies has been placed on behalf of the Federal Navy by the League of Zearla. A spokesperson for the organisation gave the following statement:

« The Federal Navy urgently requires shipments of Battle Weapons, Landmines and Performance Enhancers to be delivered to Payson Hub in the Zearla system. »

A parallel operation is being run by Imperial faction the Sirsir Co, which announced:

« The Imperial Navy's logistics division has authorised us to process deliveries of Battle Weapons, Reactive Armour and Imperial Slaves. The drop-off point is Mitchell Hangar in the Sirsir system. »

Both initiatives begin on the 3rd of January 3305 and will run for one week. If either initiative meets its targets earlier than planned, that campaign will end immediately.


* Vitadyne Admits Nanomeds of Utopian Origin
Professor Katrien Rook has responded to Pranav Antal's claim that her company's nanomedicines are of Utopian origin:

« I confess that Vitadyne Labs did not invent the nanomeds, but neither did we steal them. We were approached by independent pilots who discovered a crashed Utopian transport ship. The recovered cargo canisters were clearly medical in nature, so the foragers sold them to us as legitimate salvage. »

« I would be happy to return the original cargo to Utopia with our apologies. The new nanomeds that we have created are our property, however, and I insist that we be allowed to continue their manufacture. »

Pranav Antal swiftly issued a reply:

« Any derivative nanomedicines must also be returned to us, and production must cease. Our technology cannot be used outside Utopia. »

The Interstellar Health Organisation has said that it will review the case and make a decision.


* Countdown to Second Distant Worlds Expedition
Preparations are underway for the second Distant Worlds expedition, which will see a community of explorers cross the galaxy.

Science correspondent Leon Banerjee provided an overview for the Vox Galactica media outlet:

« The first Distant Worlds mission, in 3302, was the largest fleet expedition in history, and saw over a thousand ships travel to Beagle Point and back. »

« Distant Worlds II has even loftier ambitions, involving an impressive voyage through the heart of the galaxy, mapping unexplored regions and making new scientific discoveries. It will also involve the construction of a starport dedicated to the study of Sagittarius A*. »

« Project leaders Erimus Kamzel and Dr Kaii report that nearly four thousand courageous Commanders will take part, despite the risks involved, in a journey of over 200,000 light years. »

Distant Worlds II is scheduled to launch in January 3305, with the complete round trip lasting approximately three hundred days.

The isolationist group Nova Imperium has started mustering its forces in the Paresa system, prompting Senator Denton Patreus to issue a statement ordering the ships to disperse. The Imperial Navy must now find a way to quash the threat without it being seen as a massacre of Imperial citizens, which will only fuel further rebellion.

* Nova Imperium Musters Military Forces
The isolationist group Nova Imperium is reported to be assembling its forces in the Paresa system.

Senator Denton Patreus made this statement:

« We have evidence that this seditious organisation is amassing an armada in its home system. It consists of ships crewed by Imperator Mordanticus's ex-Navy followers, as well as the private vessels of many misguided citizens. »

« As Admiral of the Fleet, I order Nova Imperium to disperse its forces immediately or face the consequences. »

The Imperial Herald's Cassia Carvalho commented:

« Widespread support for Hadrian Duval has led to Nova Imperium amassing its fleet in a very short time. The challenge for the Imperial Navy is to quash this threat without it being seen as a massacre of Imperial citizens, which can only fuel further rebellion. »


* Empire Engages Nova Imperium
The Empire has entered a state of conflict with the isolationist group Nova Imperium in the Paresa system.

Senator Denton Patreus announced:

« The loyal Imperials of Yupini Limited have engaged the isolationists' illegal armada. We call upon Imperial auxiliaries to support our allies and destroy the Nova Imperium fleet. »

Imperator Mordanticus, leader of Nova Imperium, has requested the support of the galactic community:

« Nova Imperium's survival depends upon winning this battle. I urge all those who believe that Hadrian Duval should be the Emperor to support us. »

The two factions have set out week-long campaigns to overcome their foes, which will begin on the 10th of January 3305.


* Federal and Imperial Campaigns End
Supply campaigns for the Federal and Imperial navies have concluded successfully, with traders delivering large amounts of military provisions.

The League of Zearla, acting on behalf of the Federal Navy, stated:

« Many thanks to all the pilots who came through for the Federation. You can now collect your rewards at Payson Hub in the Zearla system. »

An announcement was also made by the Sirsir Co, which coordinated a similar supply campaign for the Imperial Navy:

« You have performed a great service for the Empire. Payments have been authorised at Mitchell Hangar in the Sirsir system. »

Marquis Felix Novantico, a retired military strategist, commented:

« Tensions caused by Nova Imperium have triggered much activity of this kind. But for the Federation to do the same suggests concern about a potentially hostile Empire, should Hadrian Duval claim the throne. »


* Crew Missing from Celebrity's Starship
A luxury star yacht belonging to famous actor Consuela Knight has reached its destination with nobody onboard.

The incident was reported by independent newsfeed The Sovereign:

« Consuela Knight's beautiful ship often attracts admirers when it arrives at a starport. But on this occasion it also brought security forces, since the custom-built private yacht was completely empty. »

« Investigators discovered that the ship was in perfect condition with all escape pods intact. There were signs of recent activity, such as unfinished meals and handheld equipment on the floor. Computer records confirmed the crew's presence until a few minutes before arrival, when all five people \u2013 including Ms Knight\u2013 simultaneously vanished. »

« Engineering and hyperspace experts have begun analysing data to unravel this mystery. But there is no reason to believe there are any survivors of this phenomenon. »


* Flashpoint for Nova Imperium
Political journalist Cassia Carvalho has reported on the current conflict with isolationist group Nova Imperium:

« In recent weeks, Nova Imperium has become a genuine political force. Tensions have now erupted into open conflict in the Paresa system, with Imperial Navy auxiliaries attempting to destroy Nova Imperium's fleet. »

« In return, Imperator Mordanticus has called on the galactic community to fight for Emperor Hengist's long-lost grandson Hadrian Duval to be recognised as an heir to the throne. »

« Whether this is a one-off battle or the beginning of an Imperial civil war, the outcome of the Battle of Paresa will influence the future of the Empire. »

Meanwhile, the Interstellar Health Organisation is reviewing Vitadyne Labs's nanomedicines, which the company has admitted are based on advanced technology developed by Utopia. Many in the medical community have argued that Utopia should share their revolutionary medicines, but investors have already pumped millions of credits into Vitadyne Labs, convinced that profits will run into the billions if these nanomeds become the galaxy's hottest new commodity.

Finally, supply campaigns for the Federal and Imperial navies have concluded successfully, with traders delivering large amounts of military provisions. The factions responsible for the parallel initiatives thanked pilots who contributed.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Vitadyne Nanomedicines Prompt Ethical Dilemma
The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) is currently reviewing Vitadyne Labs's nanomedicines, which the company has admitted are based on advanced technology developed by Utopia.

Healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey discussed the situation via Vox Galactica:

« There are always ethical considerations when approving new medicines. But in this case the IHO has more to consider than usual, not least Pranav Antal's formal complaint that replicating Utopian technology without permission is tantamount to theft. »

« Many in the medical community argue that it is selfish of Utopia to hoard such revolutionary medicines. As these nanomeds are capable of treating many illnesses and injuries, surely the potential health benefits outweigh questions of ownership. »

« On the other hand, investors have already pumped millions of credits into Vitadyne Labs, convinced that profits will run into the billions if these nanomeds become the galaxy's hottest new commodity. If that happens, only the very wealthy will be able to afford Vitadyne's product. »


* Nova Imperium Defeated in Paresa System
The conflict in the Paresa system has ended with Nova Imperium being defeated by Imperial organisation Yupini Limited.

As the conflict drew to a close, Senator Denton Patreus made the following statement:

« With the aid of our loyal Imperial auxiliaries, the isolationists' forces have been significantly depleted. Let this be a warning to others \u2013 the Empire will not tolerate insurrection. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Dyson City in the Paresa system.


* Distant Worlds Initiative
The Omega Mining Corporation has requested deliveries of raw materials for a new Orbis starport, to be built in the heart of the galaxy.

The construction of the starport constitutes part of the ambitious Distant Worlds II expedition. Project leader Erimus Kamzel told the media:

« The Distant Worlds fleet is privileged to be at the forefront of this ambitious industrial and scientific initiative \u2013 humanity's first starport in the Galactic Centre region. »

Independent miners are invited to deliver shipments of Indite, Gallite, Praseodymium and Cobalt to Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 system.

In order to protect traders, the Omega Mining Corporation has also placed kill orders on all ships on its wanted list.

The initiative begins on the 17th of January 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Vitadyne Nanomedicines Gain Legal Approval
The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) has approved Vitadyne Labs's nanomedicines as a legal medical product. A spokesperson for the IHO said:

« We accept that this product is based on nanomedicines developed by Utopia, as asserted by Simguru Pranav Antal. But our ruling is that because they were obtained as lawful salvage, the nanomeds recreated by Vitadyne Labs are its intellectual property. »

« All restrictions have been lifted, with the caveat that distribution must be handled by an established pharmaceutical company. This will ensure that strict healthcare protocols can be applied at every stage. »

Professor Katrien Rook told the media she was happy to comply with the Interstellar Health Organisation's conditions.


* Imperator Mordanticus Captured
Imperator Mordanticus, the leader of isolationist group Nova Imperium, has been captured by the Empire. His arrest was made during the conflict between Nova Imperium and the Empire in the Paresa system.

Chancellor Anders Blaine made a pronouncement on behalf of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval:

« With its fleet destroyed, Nova Imperium's seditious agenda has been halted. The so-called Imperator, Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, will be brought before the Senate on Friday the 25th of January to answer charges of treason against the Empire. »

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented in The Imperial Herald:

« For the emperor to assemble the entire Senate is a rare occurrence. It seems likely that she will make an example of Mordanticus, perhaps with a public trial. »

« Although Nova Imperium survives in the Paresa system, the loss of both its fleet and military commander may have delivered a mortal blow to the isolationist cause. »

* Mystery of Missing Crew Sparks Rumours
The disappearance of famous actor Consuela Knight and the crew of her luxury yacht has sparked a flood of rumours.

Independent reporter Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse discussed the mystery on the Rewired news feed:

« The scientists say this might be an anomaly that only affects organic tissue. But that doesn't explain the discovery of Consuela Knight's half-eaten meal, does it? »

« Others think it could be a new Thargoid weapon that disintegrates humans while leaving ships intact. Or maybe the cultists were right, and the Far God has started snacking on individuals before it arrives to eat the whole universe. »

« For all we know, this has been happening to ships for years. Maybe it usually gets hushed up, which is harder to do when a big-name celebrity vanishes. Which of us might be next? Think about that next time you jump into hyperspace\u2026 »


* Success for Distant Worlds Initiative
A request for mined materials from the Omega Mining Corporation has concluded.

Independent pilots delivered large quantities of Indite, Gallite, Praseodymium and Cobalt which will be used to build an Orbis starport in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. The starport will serve as a centre for scientific research, gathering data on the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's centre.

Erimus Kamzel, the Distant Worlds project leader, commented:

« It is with great pride that we announce the successful conclusion to this resource-extraction initiative. The fleet will now continue its journey, and is scheduled to reach the galactic core in several weeks' time. »

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 system.


* Vitadyne Nanomeds Campaign
Professor Katrien Rook of Vitadyne Labs has launched an initiative to establish a new pharmaceutical production facility.

In a statement, Professor Rook said:

« Vitadyne Labs lacks the infrastructure to mass-produce nanomedicines, so we have invited two pharmaceutical companies to bid for a distribution licence. The company that puts forward the most convincing proposal will secure the contract. »

The companies in question are Neomedical Industries, which supplies Alliance and independent systems, and the Vandermeer Corporation, which operates exclusively within Federal space. Both have requested advanced medicines, computer components and auto fabricators for the construction of nanomed manufacturing plants.

Deliveries for Neomedical Industries should be made to Alignak Jet Legal and Co at Piserchia Port in Alignak while shipments for the Vandermeer Corporation should be delivered to the Liberals of Kuma at Elion Dock in Kuma.

The competing initiatives begin on the 24th of January 3305. If either campaign meets its target earlier than planned, that campaign will end immediately.


* Commercial Travel Impacted by Hyperspace Fears
The mysterious disappearance of actor Consuela Knight and the crew of her yacht has affected confidence in commercial space travel.

Independent newsfeed The Sovereign reported:

« Consuela Knight's empty ship pulling into port has caused unease in consumer markets. Rumours of abductions and disintegrations while in hyperspace have negatively impacted many businesses. »

« Ship manufacturer Saud Kruger has said that sales of customised luxury yachts, such as Ms Knight's, have plummeted. Cruise bookings with Astrogator Tours are being cancelled, while commercial operators have reported a drop in passenger numbers. »

« Plans are underway for a memorial service to honour Consuela Knight's career. But her real legacy is the fear that her fate could befall any interstellar traveller. »


* Blood on the Senate Floor
Kaeso Mordanticus, the captured leader of isolationist group Nova Imperium, has been brought before the Imperial Senate, with unexpected results.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho was at the scene:

« Imperator Mordanticus was led into Senate House in shackles but still defiant. All rose as Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval entered, attended by Senator Denton Patreus. The Emperor and Patreus approached Mordanticus silently, whereupon Patreus executed the Imperator with his personal sidearm. »

« Suddenly, the Imperial Guard opened fire, gunning down senators Pal Vespasian and Eloise Winterstone, and others who had supported the isolationist cause. »

« Once the initial shock had subsided, the Emperor stood over the Imperator's body. In a clear voice she announced: 'There is no Nova Imperium. There is only the Empire.' »

« I have since heard reports of mass arrests and further public executions across Capitol. The rumour is that Patreus placed agents among Nova Imperium strongholds, which are now being eliminated from within. This may be the start of an Empire-wide purge. »


* Utopia Condemns Approval of Vitadyne Nanomedicines
The decision of the Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) to approve Vitadyne Labs's nanomedicines has been condemned by Utopia.

Simguru Pranav Antal made this statement:

« The IHO has allowed Vitadyne to steal and replicate Utopian nanomedical technology purely for their financial gain. This is why we do not share our advancements with the galaxy. »

Independent healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey commented:

« Vitadyne sees the Interstellar Health Organisation's decision as a victory, but others in the medical community have expressed reservations. To deny Utopia's ownership of these nanomedicines means permanently closing the door on any future cooperation with the community. What other potential benefits have been lost? »

Vitadyne Labs has invited pharmaceutical giants Neomedical Industries and Vandermeer Corporation to bid for a licence to distribute Vitadyne nanomeds in their territories.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Kaeso Mordanticus, leader of isolationist group Nova Imperium, has been executed by Senator Denton Patreus. All known members of the group have been put to death as part of a systematic purge, and citizens who supported Nova Imperium have been arrested for treason. Nova Imperium remains in control of the Paresa system, but with the organisation's power base destroyed, it no longer poses a threat to the Imperial throne.

The decision of the Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) to approve Vitadyne Labs's nanomedicines has been condemned by Utopia. Simguru Pranav Antal issued a statement accusing the IHO of allowing Vitadyne to steal and replicate Utopian nanomedical technology purely for their financial gain.

In related news, Vitadyne has launched an initiative to establish a new pharmaceutical production facility. Neomedical Industries, which supplies Alliance and independent systems, and the Vandermeer Corporation, which operates exclusively within Federal space, have both been invited to compete for a distribution license.

The mysterious disappearance of actor Consuela Knight and the crew of her yacht has affected confidence in commercial space travel, negatively impacting many businesses. A memorial service to honour Knight's career is planned, but has been overshadowed by rumours of abductions and disintegrations while in hyperspace.

Finally, a request for mined materials from the Omega Mining Corporation has concluded. Independent pilots delivered large quantities of raw materials, which will be used to build an Orbis starport in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. The starport will serve as a centre for scientific research, gathering data on the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's centre.

And those are the main stories this week.


* The Fall of Nova Imperium
Security forces across the Empire have carried out a coordinated purge of the isolationist group Nova Imperium.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho reported:

« Yesterday's executions in the Senate were apparently only the beginning of a coordinated massacre. Nova Imperium members are being put to death, and citizens who supported them are being arrested for treason. In a single day, the isolationist cause has been crushed. »

« It seems that Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval \u2013 while being accused of weakness \u2013 has simply been playing for time, allowing Senator Patreus to position his agents for a simultaneous strike. With this show of strength, the Emperor has done much to silence her detractors. »

« Despite reactions of horror from some newsfeeds, Alliance and Federal leaders have made no official comment, perhaps relieved that inter-superpower cooperation against the Thargoids will continue. »

« Nova Imperium remains in control of the Paresa system, but with the organisation's power base destroyed, it no longer poses a threat to the Imperial throne. »


* Investor Sets Sights on Supratech
Billionaire investor Lexi October has announced plans to save technology company Supratech from bankruptcy:

« Although Supratech's Torc design proved to be impractical, I feel that a company with such imagination and expertise deserves another chance to succeed. So I have decided to fund a commodity drive to get Supratech back on its feet. »

« I have invited the People's Rakapila Progressive Party to organise shipments of Computer components, Auto-fabricators and Hardware diagnostic sensors, which will enable Supratech to resume its innovative work. »

Deliveries should be made to Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system. To protect traders, the People's Rakapila Progressive Party has placed a kill order on all wanted ships in the system.

The initiative begins on the 31st of January 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Vitadyne Campaign Ends
An initiative from Vitadyne Labs to award a distribution licence to a pharmaceutical company has now concluded.

Professor Katrien Rook announced:

« Thanks to many hard-working traders, both Neomedical Industries and the Vandermeer Corporation received enormous quantities of advanced medicines, computer components and auto fabricators. »

« We are evaluating each company's ability to manufacture the nanomedicines, and will award the contract shortly. »

Pilots who made deliveries to Neomedical Industries can now collect their rewards from Piserchia Port in Alignak, while those who delivered to the Vandermeer Corporation can collect their rewards from Elion Dock in Kuma.


* The New Imperator
Hadrian Augustus Duval has broadcast a message following the purge of isolationist group Nova Imperium:

« Arissa Lavigny-Duval has revealed the true face of her regime \u2013 one based on brutality and terror. The callous execution of Imperator Mordanticus, in conjunction with thousands of Imperial citizens, shows her desperation to cling onto power at any cost. »

« Nova Imperium survives in the Paresa system, a single light in the darkness. We stand for an Empire that respects everyone, from slaves to senators. I truly hope that any who value honour and tradition will help keep our spark alive. »

« Our martyred leader will never be forgotten. In his honour, I have taken the title of Imperator Duval, until such time as the people choose me as their rightful emperor. »

« Memento Mordanticus! »


* Celebrity Admits to Faking Disappearance
The actor Consuela Knight, who recently vanished from her private yacht along with its crew, has been located at a luxury retreat.

An anonymous reporter told independent newsfeed The Sovereign:

« Consuela Knight was spotted alive and well at the Skyglow Havens on the Rhea Archipelago, where she had been living under a false identity. »

« When challenged, Ms Knight admitted that her disappearance was in fact an elaborate hoax. Fearing that her career was fading, she arranged her 'mysterious' disappearance to enhance her fame, paying her crew enormous sums to follow suit. »

« Ms Knight has now fled Rhea and is presumably living in seclusion elsewhere. »

Many of Knight's fans have disputed this account, claiming that such elaborate deception is out of character for the actor. Authorities have accepted the explanation, however, and the investigation has been officially closed.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Pharmaceutical giant Vandermeer Corporation has won the licence to distribute Vitadyne Labs's nanomedical product. In a statement, Professor Katrien Rook said the organisation's infrastructure and supply routes meant the nanomeds would soon be available to the galactic community.

Hadrian Augustus Duval has broadcast a message following the purge of isolationist group Nova Imperium, vowing to continue to pursue his claim on the Imperial throne. During the transmission, Duval claimed to have assumed the title of the recently executed Imperator Kaeso Modanticus, and accused Arissa Lavigny-Duval's regime of brutality and terror.

In other news, actor Consuela Knight, who recently vanished from her private yacht along with its crew, has been located at a luxury retreat. When questioned, Ms Knight admitted that her disappearance was an elaborate hoax designed to enhance her ailing career. Many of Knight's fans have disputed this account, but authorities have accepted the explanation.

And finally, billionaire investor Lexi October has announced plans to save technology company Supratech from bankruptcy by funding a commodity drive. October confessed an admiration for the company's imagination and expertise, and said she hoped the enterprise would provide Supratech with the materials necessary to resume its innovative work.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Supratech Initiative Concludes
A commodity drive to revive technology company Supratech has ended successfully, with large numbers of materials being delivered.

Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of Supratech, announced:

« We are immensely grateful to Lexi October for her timely investment, to the People's Rakapila Progressive Party for organising the campaign, and to all the traders who delivered these commodities. This has brought the company back from the brink, and secured our future. »

Business analysts have suggested that adding Supratech to her investment portfolio reveals Lexi October's ambitions to break into the lucrative personal-computer market.

Contributors to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system.


* Campaign for New Xeno-Research Centre
Dr Roy Casimir of the Holloway Bioscience Institute has announced plans to construct a research centre focusing on new life forms discovered by the galactic community:

« The development of the Codex has led to a number of xenological discoveries. Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility to analyse these incredible lifeforms. »

« We therefore request quantities of Cobalt, Indium and Tantalum to be delivered to Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system. »

« In addition, we ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which will form the core of our xenological research catalogue. Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse contributing pilots. »

The initiative begins on the 7th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Kincaid Raises Concerns after Nova Imperium
President Gibson Kincaid has sought to illustrate potential threats to the Alliance, highlighting isolationist group Nova Imperium as an example. Speaking to the Alliance Tribune, President Kincaid said:

« The rise of such radical beliefs demonstrates how quickly the other superpowers might turn against us. Had the recent military conflict ended differently, the Empire would have callously abandoned humanity's united struggle against the Thargoid threat. »

« All other leaders are looking elsewhere, pretending Nova Imperium never happened. But I have the courage to give a voice to our people's fears. The Alliance must prepare to stand alone against any aggressor, whether human or alien! »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon later released a brief response:

« I remind President Kincaid that his focus should be on diplomatic duties, as agreed by the Assembly. Inter-superpower cooperation against the Thargoids remains unchanged, and the Empire's internal politics do not concern the Alliance. »


* Secret Research Outpost Attacked
A Federal Navy vessel has reported the discovery of an unregistered outpost with all occupants murdered, following a response to an automatic distress signal.

The incident is being investigated by the Federal Intelligence Agency. Senior Agent Rochelle Karim made the following statement:

« This remote lunar base was designed to prevent detection, and yet it has been located and invaded by unknown forces who chose to gun down its inhabitants. It appears access codes were used to bypass security systems, as there are no signs of forced entry. »

« Initial findings suggest the outpost was dedicated to advanced nuclear research. This may have been a targeted attack in order to steal a power source, a weapon, or valuable data. »

« We are conducting a thorough examination of the site, and expect to learn more soon. »


* Ambrose Foundation Bankrupted Overnight
The family-run Ambrose Foundation, a multi-billion credit institution, has lost its entire fortune in a single day.

Business analyst Marlon Royce reported on Vox Galactica:

« The Ambrose Foundation combines the wealth of several centuries-old royal and noble houses. It is primarily involved in corporate investment and occasional charity work. »

« All of that changed abruptly when its accountants announced the loss of 100% of all assets, worth nearly three hundred billion credits. Inexplicably, everything the foundation owned has been liquidated and transferred to anonymous accounts at banks scattered throughout the galaxy. »

« Local security services are investigating a possible data hack. But of greater concern is the disappearance of family heiress Lady Talitha Ambrose. Some fear she has been kidnapped and forced to provide authorisation codes to her colossal inheritance. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

A Federal Navy vessel has discovered an unregistered outpost with all occupants murdered. According to the Federal Intelligence Agency, early evidence suggests the outpost was dedicated to advanced nuclear research.

The Ambrose Foundation, a multi-billion credit institution, has lost its entire fortune, prompting security services to investigate a possible data hack. Family heiress Lady Talitha Ambrose has also disappeared, fuelling fears of abduction by those responsible for the loss of her inheritance.

Meanwhile, a commodity drive to revive technology company Supratech has ended successfully. Scorpio DeVorrow, the company's CEO, announced that the efforts had brought the company back from the brink and secured its future.

In other news, President Gibson Kincaid has used Nova Imperium to illustrate potential threats to the Alliance. Kincaid argued that the rise of such radical movements demonstrated how the other superpowers might turn against the Alliance.

Dr Casimir said the development of the Codex had led to a number of xenological discoveries, and that the institute intended to construct a dedicated scientific facility to analyse these lifeforms.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Xeno-Research Campaign Ends
A campaign from the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully.

Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir told the media:

« Thanks to Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int we now have sufficient materials to build a planetary outpost where our scientists can study lifeforms identified by the galactic community. »

« We are also grateful for the exploration data provided by many pilots, which will help us create a new research catalogue. »

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system.


* Merope Defence Initiative
The Atlas Research Group has urgently requested military materials to increase security in the Merope system.

Defence Director Jacob Chowdhury said:

« The Thargoid presence throughout the Pleiades Nebula continues to be a major threat. To reassure the public, Atlas is investing in improved defences for the Merope system. »

« Traders are invited to deliver Reactive Armour and Military Grade Fabrics to Reed's Rest. To help protect incoming ships from criminal elements, we have also allocated bounties to all wanted vessels in the system. »

The initiative begins on the 14th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Thief Strikes Again
A number of invaluable art treasures have been stolen from the Museum of Civilisation on Mars.

Museum historian Dr Imogen Ryang said:

« The stolen pieces include Rembrandt's Self-Portrait with Two Circles (17th Century), Guernica by Picasso (20th Century) and Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke (23rd Century). Each of the works was replaced with the image of a winking cat. »

« The loss of so many cultural artefacts is incalculable. This despicable criminal should have been hunted down long ago. »

Culture journalist Kioko McGrath published an alternative view in The Federal Times:

« High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the 'winking cat' motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art. »


* Heiress Confirmed Missing
The Ambrose Foundation has confirmed that Lady Talitha Ambrose is missing, and that all of its assets have been lost.

Baroness Oksana Ambrose, head of the institution, told the media:

« Everything we own has been transferred from our accounts to who knows where. Emergency funds are being used to settle debts and pay staff, but essentially the Ambrose Foundation is ruined. »

« I can only assume that vicious criminals have kidnapped Lady Talitha and tortured her into surrendering her inheritance. »

« I have used the last of our reserves to hire the Wallglass Investigations Agency. I pray that they can locate and rescue my beloved daughter. »


* Nuclear Weapon Stolen
The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered that a nuclear weapon has been taken from an unregistered outpost.

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim made the following statement:

« Further examination of the outpost discovered last week confirms that it was home to unlicensed nuclear research. Personnel at the site were constructing a portable fusion warhead codenamed the Lucifer Device. »

« One operational prototype was produced, but we have failed to locate it. Our assumption is that whoever invaded the base now possesses a movable bomb with a 300 megaton yield \u2013 enough to destroy an entire city. »

« This investigation is a top priority and we are exploring all available leads. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has revealed that a nuclear weapon was taken from an unregistered outpost discovered last week, where dozens of personnel were gunned down by unknown perpetrators. The portable warhead, codenamed the Lucifer Device, is believed to possess enough power to destroy an entire city.

The Ambrose Foundation has confirmed that Lady Talitha Ambrose is missing, and that the family's entire fortune has been lost. Believing that Lady Talitha has been kidnapped as part of the theft, the family has employed the Wallglass Investigations Agency to locate the missing heiress.

A campaign held by the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully. The new planetary outpost will be used to study lifeforms identified by the galactic community.

In other news, a number of priceless artefacts, spanning centuries of artistic history, have been stolen from the Museum of Civilization on Mars. In each case, the works were replaced with the image of a winking cat.

Finally, the Atlas Research Group has called for shipments of military materials to increase security in the Merope system. The initiative started with pledges from Atlas that public safety in the face of continued Thargoid activity remains a priority.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Merope Defence Initiative Concludes
A military supply campaign to increase security in the Merope system has concluded successfully.

Jacob Chowdhury, Defence Director of the Atlas Research Group, said:

« Our gratitude to all the pilots who delivered Reactive Armour and Military Grade Fabrics. These resources will prove vital in enhancing Merope's defences against Thargoid attacks. »

The Atlas Research Group also helped protect traders from piracy by placing kill orders on all wanted ships in the system.

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Reed's Rest in the Merope system.


* Rivalry Triggers Conflict in Drevlyada
A long-standing enmity between two military leaders has escalated into hostilities in the Drevlyada system.

Details were provided by freelance warzone reporter Karleen Troy:

« The personal rivalry between General Kendrick of Namab Purple Brothers and Marshal Cooper of Drevlyada League has lasted for years. Each frequently accuses the other of incompetence and endangering the people of Drevlyada. »

« This grudge match has now spiralled into a state of open conflict. Both Kendrick and Cooper have asked the galactic community to provide support in crushing their opponent's forces. »

The two factions have set out week-long campaigns to take control of the Drevlyada system, which will begin on the 21st of February 3305.


* Defence Contractor Denies Safety Violations
The weapons manufacturer Prax Incorporated has dismissed accusations of poor safety measures in its development and testing programs. Concerns were originally raised by Adley King of The Federal Times, as part of an investigation into weapons testing within inhabited sectors.

CEO Lucina Prax gave this press statement:

« I can assure Ms King that my company takes every precaution when evaluating its products. We have never \u2013 and will never \u2013 ignore safety protocols. »

« Regarding these accusations, I am aware of the claims being made but have yet to see a single shred of evidence to support them. We act in full compliance with the most stringent industry regulations. »

« 3304 was a record year for Prax Incorporated. The latest version of our proprietary threat-recognition firmware propelled our stock to new heights, and we are developing a new system that I believe will be considered revolutionary. »


* Funding for Stolen Nuclear Weapon Traced
The Federal Intelligence Agency has traced the funding of an illegal nuclear research outpost to the Zlota system.

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim provided the following details:

« Having successfully decrypted the outpost's communications, we have determined that Zlota Federal Holdings was financing these unregistered research projects. Several of the organisation's principal figures were covertly redirecting public funds to construct portable nuclear weapons. »

« We suspect that one of these individuals became greedy and arranged for the outpost to be raided, acquiring the prototype Lucifer Device to subsequently sell on the black market. »

« The FIA is currently questioning the Zlota Executive Council to learn more. It is crucial that we locate the Lucifer Device, which poses a serious threat to public safety. »


* Heiress's Gambling Connections Revealed
Lady Talitha Ambrose, the missing Ambrose Foundation heiress, has been alleged to have a history of gambling that may explain the sudden loss of her family's entire fortune.

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse commented on the Rewired news feed:

« Baroness Oksana has convinced everyone that her daughter was kidnapped and forced to surrender her vast inheritance. What the baroness failed to mention is that Lady Talitha's name has long been associated with an exclusive gambling circle named Jokers' Deck. »

« Some of the wealthiest individuals in the galaxy are believed to be associated with the group, including corporate CEOs, senior politicians, minor royals, pirate lords and cartel kingpins. Several famous names are rumoured to be in Jokers' Deck, including at least one member of the Rochester family. »

« Is it possible that Lady Talitha wasn't kidnapped but is instead hiding in shame, having gambled away the entire Ambrose Foundation? »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has uncovered evidence that Zlota Federal Holdings funded an illegal outpost from which a portable nuclear weapon was recently stolen. It is believed that one of the faction's members also arranged the theft, which resulted in the massacre of personnel working at the outpost.

An independent journalist has claimed that Lady Talitha Ambrose is associated with the secretive gambling circle Joker's Deck. It was proposed that the Ambrose Foundation's bankruptcy may have followed a poor series of wagers from the missing heiress.

A supply campaign to increase security in the Merope system has concluded successfully. The Atlas Research Group had arranged for military supplies to be delivered, reassuring the local populace of their ongoing protection from the Thargoid threat.

In other news, the defence contractor Prax Incorporated has denied accusations that it has failed to comply with industry safety regulations. CEO Lucina Prax dismissed the claims, and stated that her company is working on a new weapons system following a record financial year.

Finally, a personal rivalry between two military leaders has erupted into open military conflict in the Drevlyada system. The individuals concerned, General Kendrick and Marshal Cooper, have each asked the galactic community to provide them with support.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Conflict in Drevlyada Resolved
The battle in the Drevlyada system, which sprang from a long-running rivalry between two military leaders, has now ended.

Warzone reporter Karleen Troy summarised:

« The antagonistic relationship between General Kendrick and Marshal Cooper was finally resolved when both were executed by their own lieutenants, who were displeased with the huge loss of life resulting from their leaders' quarrel. »

« Both the Namab Purple Brothers and the Drevlyada League have agreed to honour commitments to members of the galactic community who fought on each side. »

Independent pilots who took part in the conflict can now collect their rewards from the Drevlyada system. Supporters of Namab Purple Brothers should head to Wheeler Dock, while supporters of the Drevlyada League should travel to Grandin Port.


* Macrosphere Initiative
Technology company Macrosphere is developing a specialised scanning device to detect illicit interference with personal robots.

Macrosphere CEO Taniyah Sharpe provided the details:

« The recent Mars Tribune scandal proved that the illegal reprogramming of robots is a genuine concern. Our Mech Scanner will allow robot owners to discover if their trusted servants have been compromised. »

« A components drive is being organised by our partners, DS Leonis Industries. As well as shipments of micro controllers, auto fabricators and aluminium, we also require newly mined jewels, to channel the micro-lasers used by the Mech Scanner to detect interference. Deliveries should be made to Grandin Terminal in the DS Leonis system. »

The initiative begins on the 28th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Cult Obtains Nuclear Weapon
The Federal Intelligence Agency has announced that a stolen nuclear weapon known as the Lucifer Device is in the possession of a fringe cult known as the Children of Tothos.

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim gave the following statement:

« Several executives at Zlota Federal Holdings have confessed to being secret members of the Children of Tothos. They were present for a ceremony held by the cult's leader, Barnabas Cole, last December. »

« One executive, Councillor Willard Morgenstern, was also covertly funding an unrelated criminal enterprise to develop portable nuclear weapons. While under the influence of various substances, Councillor Morgenstern disclosed details of the research outpost to the cult. »

« We believe that Barnabas Cole and his followers used this information to raid the outpost and obtain the Lucifer Device. The FIA is conducting an interstellar manhunt to locate these individuals, and are treating them as highly dangerous suspects. »


* Heiress's Fortune Lost to Gambling
It has been revealed that Lady Talitha Ambrose's 300 billion credit fortune vanished as a result of her participation in a powerful gambling ring.

Confirmation came when Baroness Oksana Ambrose shared a report from the Wallglass Investigations Agency:

« Multiple sources verify that Lady Talitha has been a member of Jokers' Deck for years. At the group's most recent event, she bet the entire Ambrose Foundation during an epic game of high-stakes deadlock poker, and eventually lost. Lady Talitha was apparently devastated, fleeing the venue soon after. »

« Some attendees believe that the game was rigged by one or more other players, who aimed to exploit Lady Talitha's well-known gambling addiction. »

« The organisers of Jokers' Deck remain anonymous and untraceable, so retrieving the family's assets is unlikely. »

An Ambrose Foundation spokesperson later stated that Baroness Oksana has officially revoked Lady Talitha's title, vowing never to speak to her daughter again.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has announced that a nuclear weapon known as the Lucifer Device is in the possession of a cult known as the Children of Tothos. The cult is thought to have used information coerced from a financier to locate and raid the research outpost working on the device.

It has been revealed that Lady Talitha Ambrose's 300 billion credit fortune was lost as a result of a record high-stakes game of deadlock poker, hosted by the elusive Jokers' Deck gambling ring. Lady Talitha has been disowned by her family.

In other news, open conflict in the Drevlyada system has ceased. The battle came to a halt following the summary executions of General Kendrick and Marshal Cooper, whose personal quarrel was responsible for the considerable loss of life among their respective forces.

Finally, tech company Macrosphere is developing a specialised scanning device to detect illicit interference with personal robots. They have called for the delivery of commodities to the DS Leonis system to aid them in their efforts.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Distant Worlds Mining Campaign
The organisers of the Distant Worlds II expedition have requested materials for two construction projects in the Galactic Centre.

The exploration fleet aims to build a megaship and installation in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system.

Dr Kaii, Fleet Liaison for Deep Space Surveys, explained:

« This installation will be a place for scientists to study the supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A*. Future explorers visiting the station will be well looked after by Deep Space Surveys, to whom we will hand the keys before continuing to Beagle Point. »

Bauxite, water and liquid oxygen should be delivered to Explorer's Anchorage in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. To protect contributors, Deep Space Surveys has authorised bounty vouchers for all wanted vessels.

The initiative begins on the 7th of March 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Macrosphere Initiative Ends
A components drive for a device to detect illegally reprogrammed robots has concluded successfully.

Taniyah Sharpe, CEO of technology company Macrosphere, announced:

« There was a fantastic response to our request, which the DS Leonis Industries organised on our behalf. Many thanks to those who participated. »

« Whether you own a personal admin robot or a factory of industrial machines, the Mech Scanner will confirm that they are functioning as intended. »

Pilots who took part in the initiative can now collect their rewards from Grandin Terminal in the DS Leonis system.


* Hunt for Children of Tothos Continues
The Federal Intelligence Agency continues to search for the Children of Tothos, a fringe cult that has stolen a nuclear weapon.

Ethan Takahashi, crime correspondent for The Federal Times, reported:

« The FIA has rooted out additional cultists within the Zlota system. All fervently worship their charismatic leader, Barnabas Cole, but none seem to know his current location or plans. »

« The Children of Tothos believe they were chosen by a demonic being that exists 'in the spaces between the stars'. Cole claims that only he, aided by select adherents, can summon Tothos with an enormous ceremonial sacrifice. »

« Criminal psychologists fear that Cole's egotism permits any act that justifies his delusions, including detonation of a nuclear warhead. Since the recently stolen Lucifer Device is both portable and undetectable by security scans, practically any location might be chosen for the cult's apocalyptic ceremony. »


* Disowned Heiress Admits Gambling Addiction
The former heiress to the Ambrose Foundation has confessed that she lost her family's entire fortune through excessive gambling.

Lady Talitha \u2013 now ordinary Talitha Ambrose \u2013 provided this statement to Vox Galactica:

« Everything you've read is true. I attended a lavish event hosted by Jokers' Deck, staked the entire Ambrose estate and lost it all. But I don't regret a thing. »

« The gambling problem I've suffered with for years has finally been cured. I believe my addiction was fuelled by having far more wealth than any individual should. I now plan to use my connections to raise funds for addiction support charities. »

« I don't blame Jokers' Deck for my situation, since I knew the risks when I joined. And frankly, it could have been worse \u2013 I've seen corporations won and lost over a hand of deadlock poker. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The search for Barnabas Cole, leader of the Children of Tothos, has resulted in further arrests. Cole's alleged possession of the stolen Lucifer Device remains a serious concern to the Federal Intelligence Agency.

Talitha Ambrose, former heiress to the Ambrose Foundation fortune, has confessed to having a gambling addiction. She confirmed that her family's estate had been lost during a Jokers' Deck event, and pledged her future work to fundraising for addiction charities.

An initiative on behalf of Macrosphere has concluded successfully, with enough materials provided by the galactic community to begin manufacture of a new robot-screening device.

Finally, organisers of the Distant Worlds II expedition have requested materials for two deep-space construction projects. The exploration fleet aims to build a megaship and installation in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Distant Worlds Campaign Concludes
The Distant Worlds II expedition has gathered resources for a megaship and installation to be constructed in the Galactic Centre.

Contributors delivered huge amounts of materials to the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. Deep Space Surveys also defended miners by placing a kill order on all wanted ships.

Commander Michael Darkmoor of the Rock Rats stated:

« The newly built astrophysics station will enable us to observe high-detail changes to the gravimetric field surrounding Sagittarius A*. We hope to better understand the deeper relationships between extreme gravity and multi-dimensional space. »

The Distant Worlds II exploration fleet will continue its journey across the galaxy, towards Beagle Point.

Those who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Explorer's Anchorage in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system.


* Nuclear Threat Shuts Down Starport
Archambault terminal in the Chun Tstar system has been overtaken by the Children of Tothos cult, who are threatening to detonate a stolen nuclear weapon.

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim gave this statement:

« Most services at Archambault terminal have shut down as a result of the control deck's occupation by Children of Tothos adherents. It's evident that personnel are obeying the cultists' orders for fear that they will use the Lucifer Device. »

« Millions of people remain at the starport, making a frontal assault too risky. FIA negotiators are taking steps to open a dialogue and resolve the situation peacefully. »

The cult's leader, Barnabas Cole, transmitted a brief message using Archambault terminal's communications array:

« At last, we have found the place where our testament's light will shine. Join us. When the ceremony is complete, you will all see Tothos as we do. »


* Rackham Fatality Creates Power Struggle
Rackham Capital Investments has appointed a new CFO following the death of its former financial officer.

Business analyst Marlon Royce reported on the situation:

« Aaron Salazar was CFO at Rackham Capital Investments from its inception. After a sudden cardiac arrest at the Ivystone Spa proved terminal, the board of directors voted to install Taja Gavaris as his replacement. Little is known of Gavaris outside of her meteoric rise up the corporate ladder. »

« CEO Zachary Rackham was not present at the vote, the CEO has taken a leave of absence to cope with his grief. « The multi-billionaire businessman, also known as 'Calico Zack', established the company following a lucrative career as an independent trader, although rumours persist that he actually operated as a pirate. »

« Insiders have speculated that Gavaris's appointment may be part of a scheme to oust Rackham from the top spot. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Children of Tothos cult has taken control of Archambault terminal in the Chun Tstar system. Access to most station services has been suspended. It is feared that the cult's leader, Barnabas Cole, plans to detonate the Lucifer Device as part of an apocalyptic ceremony.

Rackham Capital Investments has appointed Taja Gavaris as its new CFO, following the death of its former financial officer. CEO Zachary Rackham was not involved in Gavaris's appointment, leading to speculation of a scheme to remove Rackham from the company.

And finally, the Distant Worlds II expedition has gathered the resources required to construct a new megaship and installation in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. The fleet will now continue its journey towards Beagle Point.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Distant Worlds Starport Operational
The first starport constructed in the Galactic Centre region has officially opened its doors.

Explorer's Anchorage, an Orbis starport, has been built in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system as part of the Distant Worlds II expedition.

Councillor Magnolia Gill, the starport administrator, announced its operational status:

« For the last four weeks we have watched our new home take shape, using materials delivered by many hard-working pilots. Now it spins in the galaxy's heart, a monument to humanity's ingenuity. »

« As well as serving as a safe haven for future explorers, Explorer's Anchorage is a scientific research installation. We hope to learn more about the supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A* and other astronomical phenomena in the Galactic Centre. »

The Distant Worlds II exploration fleet is continuing its journey across the galaxy towards Beagle Point.


* Cultist Occupation of Starport Continues
Archambault Terminal in the Chun Tstar system remains under threat of nuclear destruction by the Children of Tothos.

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim updated the media:

« Despite the best efforts of our negotiators, the cultists remain in control of the starport and still intend to detonate the Lucifer Device. This 300 megaton weapon is capable of wiping out Archambault Terminal, along with the starport's entire population. »

« Their leader, Barnabas Cole, has transmitted messages via the starport's comms array, repeating claims of 'preparing to bring Tothos's light to us all'. There is no mention of a deity named Tothos in historical or mythical records, which suggests the faith was recently founded by Cole. »

« Despite this, several civilian ships arrived in the Chun Tstar system over the past few days, attracted by Cole's sermons and seeking to join the cult. The FIA is monitoring the situation closely. »


* Survivor Found at Far God Outpost
The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered an intact cryogenic pod underneath an outpost once used by Far God worshippers.

Freelance reporter Alexei Keel broke the news on Vox Galactica:

« The FIA survey team had been scanning the abandoned base on Etain 4 c with customised military sensors. It's thought this operation is part of a search for a missing undercover agent who infiltrated the Far God cult. »

« A faint power source was detected in a collapsed underground chamber, which led agents to a solitary cryogenic pod hidden beneath tons of debris. Once excavated, it was conveyed to a medical facility where efforts to safely revive its occupant are now underway. »

« There was no way of identifying who is inside the pod. But it seems likely that they are one of the adherents who recorded audio logs at the site, prior to entering suspended animation to await the Far God. »


* Pirate History of Taja Gavaris Unveiled
Taja Gavaris, the new CFO of Rackham Capital Investments, has been accused of having a criminal background as a pirate leader.

Journalist Bryanna Blanco made this declaration in The Federal Times:

« During my reporting on multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham, I have become convinced that he and many others employed by Rackham Capital Investments were once pirates, who laundered their stolen money and moved into legitimate business. »

« New research has proved that Taja Gavaris was once a criminal rival of Rackham. I believe that Gavaris used her knowledge of Rackham's past to blackmail her way into his organisation, and is now challenging for ownership by eliminating his loyal supporters. »

« The Federal Times has published many similar revelations about 'Calico Zack' over the years, yet no criminal investigation has been established. Perhaps this time the authorities will investigate before Gavaris's vendetta escalates further, potentially endangering civilian lives. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Archambault Terminal remains under the control of the Children of Tothos. Negotiation with the cult's leader, Barnabas Cole, has proven ineffective so far. Despite evidence suggesting that the deity Tothos was created by Cole, several civilian ships have travelled to the Chun Tstar system seeking to join the cult.

Taja Gavaris, the new CFO of Rackham Capital Investments, was accused of concealing a criminal background. It is believed that Gavaris is preparing to challenge CEO Zachary Rackham for leadership of the company, continuing a rivalry dating back years to when the two allegedly operated as pirates.

In other news, an intact cryogenic pod has been recovered from an abandoned outpost once used by Far God worshippers. It is unknown who occupies the pod, but early indications suggest it is one of the adherents who recorded audio logs previously discovered at the site.

Finally, Explorer's Anchorage has officially opened in the Galactic Centre region. The Orbis starport has been built in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system as part of the Distant Worlds II expedition.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Children of Tothos Begin Sacrifices
The Children of Tothos are preparing to destroy Archambault Terminal with a stolen nuclear weapon, sacrificing millions of lives in the name of their deity.

Crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi of the Federal Times delivered this report:

« Ritual sacrifices have now begun, according to a chilling broadcast from cult leader Barnabas Cole. He claims these deaths will lead to a final ceremony, when the Lucifer Device will be detonated. Dozens of the starport's citizens are already feared dead at the hands of cultists. »

« Cole also made this statement: 'We welcome new followers who heed my testament by sending one of their siblings into Tothos's light.' »

« Since this message, disturbing reports have been received of newly docked ships killing one of their own crew, so that the rest are granted permission to join the cult. »

« Federal authorities are still unsure how to free Archambault Terminal without risking its annihilation. »


* Second Fatality in Rackham Conflict
The head of personnel at Rackham Capital Investments has died in an accident, becoming the second senior-level employee to have died in recent weeks.

Journalist Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:

« Senior executive Derrin O'Shea was killed when his personal limousine malfunctioned and crashed. The incident has not been ruled as suspicious. O'Shea's position was filled within hours by a supporter of Taja Gavaris, however. Gavaris herself inherited the CFO role in a similar fashion following her predecessor's recent death. »

« With two close allies gone, CEO Zachary Rackham must feel under threat. This corporate power struggle increasingly resembles two pirate captains fighting to become overall leader. »

« The authorities have again declined to begin a formal investigations into Gavaris and Rackham, claiming a lack of evidence. How many more casualties must occur before this conflict is taken seriously? »


* Far God Survivor Revived
The occupant of a cryogenic pod recovered from an abandoned outpost used by the Far God sect has been revived successfully.

17 year old Kiona O'Connor has been confirmed as the occupant. Following medical checks and an extended debriefing by the Federal Intelligence Agency, she made this statement to Vox Galactica:

« I'd been homeless for a long time when the monks took me in. I never understood much about the Far God, really\u2026I just needed to get off the streets. A lot of people there were like me. »

« Somehow I ended up at the outpost, where they put us all into suspended animation. I've no idea what happened after that. I'm just grateful to be alive. I hope the others are too\u2026I hope they got whatever they were praying for. »

The FIA has contacted Kiona's father, John O'Connor, and arranged for her to be escorted to her family home.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Children of Tothos are preparing to detonate the Lucifer Device as part of an apocalyptic ceremony that would destroy Archambault Terminal. Transmissions have been received indicating that ritual sacrifices have occurred at the starport, with civilians wishing to join the cult being forced to kill one of their crew upon docking to prove their devotion.

Rackham Capital Investments has experienced a second tragedy, as the head of personnel suffered a fatal accident. The position was quickly filled with a supporter of Taja Gavaris, the recently installed CFO is believed to be positioning herself to acquire the company from owner Zachary Rackham.

In other news, the occupant of a cryogenic pod retrieved from an outpost once used by Far God worshippers has been revived. Kiona O'Connor, a runaway taken in by the cult, was placed in suspended animation along with many other adherents. She has since been returned to her family home.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Starport Saved from Destruction
The Children of Tothos cult has been prevented from detonating a nuclear weapon intended to destroy Archambault Terminal.

Crime correspondent for the Federal Times, Ethan Takahashi, delivered this special report:

« Terror struck the starport when cult leader Barnabas Cole announced the final ceremony to summon their deity, Tothos, by sacrificing millions of people. »

« As Cole prepared to activate the Lucifer Device he was shot dead by one of his followers, who subsequently revealed herself as Senior Agent Rochelle Karim. Other Federal Intelligence Agency operatives moved to arrest Cole's acolytes and secure the control deck. »

« We've since learned that Karim's unit was posing as Tothos worshippers eager to join the cult. They had staged the death of a team member to receive access to the starport. »

« The Lucifer Device has now been disarmed and secured, while station services are returning to normal. »


* Rackham Under Investigation
The Federal Times has been asked to assist with a criminal investigation into Rackham Capital Investments.

Journalist Bryanna Blanco reported on the details:

« Operatives from the Federal Intelligence Agency have contacted our offices regarding the recent deaths at Zachary Rackham's company. We are cooperating with their inquiry and have agreed to share all relevant documentation. »

« The Federal Times has been monitoring the suspicious activities of 'Calico Zack' for years, so we're relieved that the authorities are at last taking these allegations seriously. Our discoveries about Taja Gavaris \u2013 who seems to be clearing the path up the corporate ladder by any means necessary \u2013 are of particular concern. »

« We expect Rackham, Gavaris and many other ex-pirates masquerading as businessmen to answer all charges brought against them. »


* Aisling Duval Contacts Hadrian Duval
Princess Aisling Duval has revealed that she recently visited Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, leader of the isolationist group Nova Imperium.

The Imperial Herald published her statement:

« For some time, I have regretted my initial dismissal of Hadrian. Had I known that Arissa intended to carry out such a brutal purge of his followers, my approach would have been different. »

« Although he has been labelled an enemy of the Empire, I found myself unable to ignore this new member of the Duval family, and so requested a meeting in the Paresa system. »

« Another reason to make contact was to verify his claim to be Emperor Hengist's grandson. All the genetic tests were conclusive \u2013 Hadrian is indeed my cousin by blood. »

« We have now opened a dialogue to see if there can ever be common ground between us. Perhaps together we can heal divisions within the Empire. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Children of Tothos have been thwarted in their attempt to destroy Archambault Terminal. Cult leader Barnabas Cole was killed by Special Agent Rochelle Karim while preparing to detonate the nuclear Lucifer Device, as Federal Intelligence agents arrested the remaining cultists. Karim and her team had infiltrated the starport by posing as devotees of the cult.

The Federal Times has been asked to provide evidence as part of an FIA investigation into Rackham Capital Investments. A number of employees, including owner Zachary Rackham and current CFO Taja Gavaris, are understood to be the focus of the inquiry.

In other news, Princess Aisling Duval has revealed details of a secret meeting with Hadrian Augustus Duval. The two met in the Paresa system, with Princess Duval expressing regret at the violent purge of Nova Imperium members. She further stated that genetic testing confirmed Hadrian's lineage.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Children of Tothos Disbands
The Children of Tothos cult has been forcibly disbanded following its recent attempt to destroy Archambault Terminal with a nuclear weapon.

The aftermath of the crisis was described by Ethan Takahashi of the Federal Times:

« There has been widespread gratitude to the Federal Intelligence Agency for saving millions of lives. Senior Agent Rochelle Karim was praised for exploiting Barnabas Cole's acceptance of new followers, giving her tactical team an opportunity to infiltrate the cult's ranks. »

« Celebrations have been coloured by the news that hundreds of starport citizens were ritually murdered before the cultists could be apprehended. The FIA has vowed to carry out a review of other fringe religions with a view to preventing similar tragedies. »

« Questions are also being asked about the regulation of nuclear research. It is unknown if the Lucifer Device was unique or if other portable mass-casualty weapons have been secretly developed. »


* Rackham Investigation Ruled Out
The Federal Intelligence Agency has denied that it is conducting a criminal investigation of Rackham Capital Investments.

A spokesperson for the FIA gave the following statement:

« Contrary to recent statements by the journalist Bryanna Blanco, we did not contact her seeking to obtain documentation, and are not running any investigation. »

« There is no evidence of criminality within Rackham Capital Investments. Our agency has received charitable donations from that organisation in the past, and Mr Rackham himself is a long-standing member of the FIA Civilian Oversight Board. Such a relationship would not be possible if we had any doubts about the integrity of Mr Rackham's business dealings. »

Bryanna Blanco published a response in The Federal Times:

« If this is true, then who were the FIA agents that visited our offices? I spoke to them personally and asked to see their credentials. Who has obtained our data regarding the criminal histories of Zachary Rackham and many others? »


* The Princess and the Imperator
News of a meeting between Princess Aisling Duval and Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has caused controversy throughout the Empire.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho reviewed the situation:

« Princess Aisling is surely aware that contacting Hadrian Duval was a politically risky move. Senator Zemina Torval has wasted no time in branding the princess 'an ideological traitor' for associating with isolationists. »

« Family connections aside, Hadrian's traditionalist views do not align with Aisling's progressive approach. But he is young and inexperienced, with policies inherited from the extremist Imperator Mordanticus. »

« Perhaps Aisling hopes that, by learning to adapt, this long-lost member of the Duval family may yet play a part on the galactic stage. »

Federal Intelligence Agency agent Rochelle Karim was praised for exploiting the cult's acceptance of new followers, giving her tactical team an opportunity to infiltrate the cult's ranks.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has denied that it is conducting a criminal investigation of Rackham Capital Investments. In a statement, the FIA said it had not contacted the journalist Bryanna Blanco to ask for access to her files. Blanco has since queried if the agents who took her data were in fact part of the FIA.

Finally, news of a meeting between Princess Aisling Duval and Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has caused controversy throughout the Empire, with Zemina Torval branding the princess 'an ideological traitor'. Commentators have suggested that Princess Aisling intends to steer Hadrian away from the extremist policies he inherited from Kaeso Mordanticus.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Aegis Forms Partnership with Ram Tah
Aegis has entered into a partnership with the engineer Ram Tah to manufacture Guardian-related technology.

Senior Engineer Lilith Galloway made the following statement on behalf of Aegis:

« We believe that Ram Tah's accomplishments, while impressive, represent only a fraction of what can be accomplished. We have therefore entered into an agreement that will allow Aegis to bring its considerable resources to bear in the manufacture of Guardian-related technology, both now and in the future. »

Galloway confirmed that technology brokers would remain licensed distributors of the Trident, Javelin and Lance XG fighters.

Ram Tah also gave a short statement to the media:

« To me, Aegis represents what can be achieved when humanity pulls together, and I am delighted to be entering into this partnership. »


* Thargoids Wreak Havoc in Core Systems
It has now been more than two months since the Thargoids began a concentrated assault on the core systems, and in that time they have attacked dozens of starports, resulting in thousands of casualties.

As authorities in the affected systems continue to appeal for aid, Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, has offered the following assessment:

« What's surprising is that the Thargoids aren't targeting our most important social or military centres, such as the superpowers' home systems. There's no doubt that they're trying to weaken us, but evidently they're guided by different principles than those that typically govern human martial strategy. »

« What we can say is this: with capital ships of limited use against Thargoid craft, independent combat pilots remain our best defence against the Thargoids. »


* Hadrian Duval Confirms Pact
Hadrian Augustus Duval has provided a statement regarding his recent communications with Princess Aisling Duval.

The following announcement was broadcast on all Imperial media channels:

« After much discussion, Princess Aisling and I have formally agreed to a non-aggression pact. While it would be premature for either side to consider the other an ally, we have pledged not to oppose each other or interfere with the activities of our respective supporters. »

« I am grateful to my cousin for her courage in establishing contact. Although I stand firm on my previously stated beliefs, at Aisling's request I will review Nova Imperium's policies with an open mind. »

« For now, I must remain a member of the Imperial family in exile. »


* Vodel Purchased by Core Dynamics
Vodel is a familiar name to many, the independent company having cornered the market in personal land vehicles in recent years. But according to The Federal Times, a downturn in profits has led to the company being purchased by Core Dynamics, a giant in the field of starship manufacture.

Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester gave the following statement to The Federal Times:

« There's no question that the Vodel team possesses considerable expertise, and I'm delighted that Core Dynamics was able to help them in their hour of need. »

« Vodel's core team of designers and engineers will remain in place under our roof, so consumers can rest easy \u2013 the Scarab they know and love will remain unchanged. »

In a piece for Vox Galactica, business analyst Marlon Royce observed:

« Core Dynamics was smart to keep the Vodel team intact, since they clearly know their stuff. It's an excellent deal for both companies. »


* Pilots' Federation Establishes Regulated Zone
The Pilots' Federation has revealed plans to establish a restricted area of space for newly licensed Commanders.

In a statement, spokesperson Gabriel Sanchos gave the following details:

« Following discussions with the three superpowers, representatives have acknowledged that independent pilots are a mainstay of the galactic community. As such, a Pilots' Federation District will be created for new Commanders, offering combat exercises and tailored assignments within several designated systems.\

« The intention is to offer pilots an opportunity to complete contract assignments without exposing them to opportunistic criminals. Access to the district will depend on the possession of a permit granted to new Commanders alongside their Pilots' Federation license. This permit will be revoked once a certain level of experience has been acquired. »

Representatives of the Alliance, Empire and Federation each confirmed their approval. Their statements underscored the positive contributions made by licensed Commanders with regards to the galactic economy, exploration initiatives and the Thargoid threat.


* Taja Gavaris Resigns as Rackham CFO
Taja Gavaris, the CFO of Rackham Capital Investments, has unexpectedly resigned from her position and subsequently emigrated from Federal space.

Several other employees who were loyal to Gavaris resigned alongside her. All chose to waive their final salaries and bonuses, which totalled approximately 365 million credits according to sources within the company.

Journalist Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:

« It has become apparent that the Federal Intelligence Agents who acquired our data on Zachary Rackham were in fact imposters working for him, employing fake credentials. With our research, Rackham would be capable of blackmailing fellow ex-pirate Taja Gavaris into resigning \u2013 the corporate equivalent of assassinating a rival. »

« Naturally, we cannot prove this is what has occurred. But rest assured that we'll continue keeping a close eye on Calico Zack. »

The Federal Times also confirmed that a donation of 36.5 million credits has been received from Rackham Capital Investments, 'in recognition of the organisation's dedication to ethical journalism'.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Aegis has entered into a partnership with the engineer Ram Tah to manufacture Guardian-related technology. In a statement, Aegis asserted that its considerable resources would ensure the supply of current and future technology, while clarifying that the XG fighters would remain available from technology brokers.

Authorities in systems recently attacked by the Thargoids have issued fresh appeals for aid. Admiral Aden Tanner commented that the Thargoids were apparently ignoring key social and military targets, and stated that independent pilots remained humanity's most effective defence.

In other news, Taja Gavaris has resigned from her post as CFO of Rackham Capital Investments, amid claims from the Federal Times that it provided information on owner Zachary Rackham to fake FIA operatives. It is thought that the data was used to blackmail Gavaris into stepping down along with several supporters.

Vodel, manufacturer of the Scarab SRV, has been purchased by Core Dynamics following a downturn in profits. Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester made a statement confirming that his company would retain Vodel's core team of designers and engineers. Business analysts are viewing the acquisition as a smart investment.

Hadrian Duval has declared a non-aggression pact with Princess Aisling Duval. While Hadrian reaffirmed his existing views and his status as a royal exile, he pledged to keep an open mind regarding Nova Imperium's policies.

Finally, the Pilots' Federation has announced the establishment of a permit-controlled area tailored to new pilots. The district offers independent pilots combat exercises and tailored assignments within several designated systems.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Ship Stolen from Starport
An independent pilot's ship has been stolen from a starport hangar in the Vega system.

The ship's owner, Commander Bjorn Lennox, told Vox Galactica:

« I'd docked my Diamondback Explorer at Fort Dixon for some routine maintenance, and to enjoy a short break following a deep space exploration voyage. When I went back to the landing pad I discovered the hangar was empty and my ship had gone missing! »

The starport issued a statement from Security Chief Misaki Sanders:

« We are at a loss to explain how the thief managed to hijack our security network, gain entry to a docked and sealed ship, and override authorisation checks to fly out of the station unchallenged. »

« Nearby systems have been alerted and we are collecting leads to track down the stolen vessel. In the meantime, we are conducting an inquiry into how these breaches of docking bay protocols could have occurred. »


* Kincaid and Mahon Clash in Alliance Assembly
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has once again clashed with President Gibson Kincaid, following the latter's attempt to take control of government policy during an Assembly session.

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

« There were dramatic scenes in the Assembly as President Kincaid sought to steer debates on military strategy, making several demands for increased funding towards new fleets. »

« Prime Minister Mahon eventually stepped in and rejected these proposals outright. Kincaid was further reminded that a prior request for executive presidential powers had been unsuccessful, even if he insists on behaving otherwise. »

« Although he still has supporters, a number of councillors have privately opined that Kincaid is now a toxic presence at odds with the Alliance's ethos. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has clashed with President Kincaid in the Alliance Assembly. Following repeated demands to increase military funding, Kincaid was reminded by Mahon that executive presidential power had been turned down following a vote. The funding proposals were rejected.

A Diamondback Explorer has been stolen from Fort Dixon in the Vega system despite a number of active security measures. Details indicate the thief was able to override the starport's security network and gain access to the ship from within the landing pad hangar.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Zende Partners Announces Transport Service
Zende Partners has revealed plans to establish a ferry service between the core systems and Guardian space.

Freya Taine, the company's CEO, made this statement:

« In response to increasing demand for Guardian commodities, my company aims to facilitate access to the area once occupied by the Guardians. This will involve the construction of a megaship to transport pilots to and from this comparatively inaccessible region. »

« Five systems have been highlighted as potential destinations, and we'd like to invite the galactic community to decide which of these should serve as the termination point for the megaship. We will then build an outpost in the chosen system, and the megaship will enter service. »

« We hope that this initiative will stimulate new innovations in the field of Guardian-human technology. »


* Event: Interstellar Initiative - Bridging the Gap



* Distant Worlds Expedition Reaches Beagle Point
The Distant Worlds II expedition has reached its final destination on the far side of the galaxy: the Beagle Point system.

Science correspondent Leon Banerjee reported for Vox Galactica:

« The Distant Worlds exploratory fleet, comprising thousands of independent pilots, set out from the Pallaeni system on 13th January 3305. Over three months later, after travelling more than 73,000 light years, ships have begun arriving at Beagle Point. »

« Included among the expedition's achievements is the construction of the scientific research station Explorer's Anchorage. This now serves as a permanent waypoint for travellers to the galactic core, as well as facilitating detailed observation of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. »

« While Distant Worlds II is coming to a close, its participants will now plot their own routes through unexplored space back towards the core systems. »


* Docked Ship Thief Identified
The individual responsible for stealing a docked Diamondback Explorer in the Vega system has been identified.

Fort Dixon Security Chief, Misaki Sanders, told the media:

« We have determined that Commander Bjorn Lennox's vessel was stolen by a starship technician, who evidently acted alone without backup. »

« The technician, Gan Romero, has worked at Fort Dixon as a member of the hanger service teams for the past eleven years. He has a stable home life on the station with a wife and three children, with no criminal record. »

« Although Romero's job gave him access to landing pads, it does not explain his ability to bypass ship security protocols or launch without authorisation. We have yet to determine his motive or destination. »

« The scope of our investigation is widening and we hope to know more soon. »


* President Kincaid Illegal Funding Allegations
President Gibson Kincaid has been accused of receiving illegal campaign funding via the Bank of Zaonce.

Councillor Elijah Beck presented evidence to a special session of the Alliance Assembly:

« During September 3304, President Kincaid's re-election campaign received several billion credits worth of undeclared funds. I have received data suggesting that these transactions were secretly arranged by a senior figure within the Bank of Zaonce. »

« Regrettably I cannot reveal the source of this evidence since it constitutes part of an ongoing investigation. However, I call upon the Assembly to open an official inquiry to establish if there was any violation of campaign finance law. »

Councillor Beck's proposal was approved by a majority vote, after which Prime Minister Edmund Mahon authorised the inquiry to begin immediately.

As yet there has been no comment from President Kincaid.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Distant Worlds II expedition has reached Beagle Point, its final destination. Thousands of independent pilots have travelled over 73,000 light years in the past three months, with the establishment of Explorer's Anchorage among their many achievements.

President Kincaid has been accused of receiving illegal campaign funding from a senior figure at the Bank of Zaonce. Following a vote at the Alliance Assembly, Prime Minister Mahon authorised an official inquiry to establish the truth of these allegations. Kincaid is yet to provide an official response.

In other news, the thief of a ship stolen from a starport hangar in the Vega system has been named as Gan Romero.  Security reports indicate Romero has no prior criminal record and is believed to have acted alone. The search for his motive and current location continues.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Zende Partners Transport Service Operational
A megaship service offering transport to Guardian space from Zende is now in operation.

The CEO of Zende Partners, Freya Taine, announced:

« Following the recommendation of the galactic community, my company has established an outpost in Synuefe EN-H d11-96 that will serve as the termination point for this new ferry service. Our two megaships, Sadler's Song and The Conduit, will make weekly trips to the selected location. »

« This first step of our initiative should encourage activity at nearby Guardian ruins. In addition, we have now finalised the design of an advanced military module based on Guardian technology, and we hope to begin manufacture of this design very soon. »

Among the feedback from the technology industry was a statement by Cedrik Stone, CEO of rival arms manufacturer Segnen Exchange:

« While Zende Partners' recent efforts to promote Guardian-human research are admirable, I would like to remind Ms. Taine that she does not hold a monopoly on Guardian artefacts from that region of space. Segnen Exchange has a proven track record in this field, and we hope that Zende Partners are able to secure the acquisition of Guardian commodities for the benefit of all. »


* President Kincaid Denies Corruption
President Gibson Kincaid has refuted allegations of illegal campaign funding and is refusing to cooperate with the official inquiry.

He gave this statement to The Alliance Tribune:

« The claims are nothing more than an attempt to besmirch my reputation. Councillor Elijah Beck has fabricated this wild mudlark chase as revenge for his loss to me in the presidential vote last year. »

« If the Assembly wants to entertain conspiracies, they could review the assassination of Fazia Silva, the third presidential candidate. It's interesting that Beck's own campaign gained a lot of support after Silva was murdered. »

The Bank of Zaonce has also declined the inquiry's requests for information. A spokesperson insisted that all campaign funds it handles adhere to strict financial guidelines. They added that Beck's evidence was deemed insufficient until a verified source could be provided.


* Ship Theft Mystery Deepens
Mystery continues to surround Gan Romero, the starship technician who single-handedly stole a docked vessel in the Vega system.

Romero's wife, Lara, agreed to an interview with Vox Galactica:

« I haven't the faintest idea why Gan took that ship, or how he managed it. It's totally out of character for him. He's not impulsive or even ambitious really. Always been the practical type, which is why I married him. I can't believe that he would do anything like this. »

« Had he been acting strangely? Well, something was on Gan's mind\u2026I guess you could say he's been distracted recently. I've caught him staring out into space a few times. And his sleep was disturbed by intense dreams, although he never wanted to talk about them. »

« The kids keep asking when their dad is coming home. I just hope the Fort Dixon security services can find some explanation for all this, and bring Gan home to us. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

A megaship service offering transport to Guardian space has been established by Zende Partners. The service will ferry pilots and ships between Zende and Synuefe EN-H d11-96, with the latter system selected as the termination point by the galactic community.

President Gibson Kincaid has denied claims of illegal funding during his presidential campaign last year, accusing Councillor Elijah Beck of seeking revenge for defeat in those elections. Kincaid also suggested that the assassination of rival presidential candidate Fazia Silva had benefited Beck's campaign.

In other news, the wife of ship thief Gan Romero has given an interview to Vox Galactica. Lara Romero stated that she had no idea why her husband would steal a docked craft. She also indicated that Gan's sleep had been disturbed by vivid dreams prior to the theft.

* Zende Partners Requests Guardian Commodities
Zende Partners has called for increased deliveries of Guardian commodities in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, the newly established hub for Guardian-human technological research.

CEO Freya Taine made the following announcement:

« My company has established a scientific research outpost in Guardian space named The Prospect, which also serves as the termination point for our megaship transport service from the Zende system. The next step is to procure a licence that will allow a technology broker to trade from The Prospect. »

« In preparation for this, we invite the galactic community to collect Guardian commodities from nearby ancient ruins and bring them to the outpost. This will allow us to provide a stock of existing Guardian-human technology, while also stimulating further studies into this extinct civilisation. »

Deliveries should be made to The Prospect in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system.

The appeal begins on the 16th of May 3305 and will run for one week. If the maximum requested total is achieved earlier than planned, Zende Partners will end the campaign immediately.


* Segnen Exchange Announces Outpost
Segnen Exchange has revealed plans to build an outpost in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system.

CEO Cedrik Stone gave the following statement:

« As Zende Partners has graciously provided a transport service to Guardian space, it makes sense for my company to support the increased pilot activity in that area. Segnen Exchange can offer a variety of services to those travelling to the area. »

« Segnen Exchange thrives at the forefront of innovation, and the wealth of artefacts soon to flow through Synuefe EN-H d11-96 offers fantastic opportunities in the field of advanced Guardian-human technology. »

The announcement, coming so soon after Zende Partners established The Prospect in the same system, has received a mixed response from business analysts. Some view the move as likely to trigger direct conflict between the two corporations, while others believe the presence of both companies can only benefit the research initiative.


* Ship Thief's Personal Log Discovered
A journal maintained by Gan Romero, the technician responsible for stealing a docked vessel from a starport hangar, has been discovered.

Security Chief Misaki Sanders gave this statement from Fort Dixon:

« We have thoroughly investigated Romero's background to establish a motive for the theft and how it was accomplished. Our only lead is a series of encrypted voice logs that he deleted shortly before the hijack. »

« Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing 'an area of space, not black but radiant\u2026glowing like heaven,' and being called by 'voices that didn't come from anything with a body'. »

« Medical experts have proposed that Romero's recordings, along with his recent distracted behaviour, may be symptoms of an undiagnosed dissociative disorder. If true, Romero was likely acting upon dream delusions when he stole the ship. At present, our investigation has not yielded anything more substantial. »


* Kincaid Granted Command of Zaonce Fleet
President Gibson Kincaid has been named commander-in-chief of the Alliance Defence Force fleet in the Zaonce system.

Journalist Vanya Driscoll reported on the development for The Alliance Tribune:

« Admiral Frederick Yamamoto has announced that the Zaonce fleet now takes orders directly from the president, in direct breach of the existing ADF command structure. »

« The move is widely perceived to be a deliberate show of strength from President Kincaid, who is currently under investigation for illegal campaign funding. Admiral Yamamoto is known to be a personal friend to Kincaid, from the latter's time as governor of Zaonce. »

« The Council of Admirals has demanded that Yamamoto rescinds this decree. Admiral Rachel Ziegler condemned the decision as 'political grandstanding that borders on treason'. »

While President Kincaid has accepted the authority, he has yet to issue any orders to the ADF fleet stationed in Zaonce.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

President Gibson Kincaid has been named as commander-in-chief of the Alliance Defence Force in the Zaonce system. The announcement by Admiral Frederick Yamamoto, known to be a personal friend of Kincaid, was poorly received by the Council of Admirals who demanded that the decree be rescinded.

Zende Partners has called for increased deliveries of Guardian commodities in Synuefe EN-H d11-96. CEO Freya Taine revealed that the next step of their Guardian research initiative is the appointment of a technology broker. The galactic community has been invited to bring commodities from Guardian ruins to The Prospect.

In related news, Segnen Exchange has announced plans to install their own outpost in Synuefe EN-H d11-96. In a statement, the company revealed they seek to take advantage of the increased Guardian commodity trade in the system.

And finally, a dream journal maintained by Gan Romero has been discovered by investigators. Romero, the technician responsible for stealing a docked craft from the Vega system, recorded a number of entries prior to the theft suggesting that vivid dream delusions may have played a role.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Corporations Clash in Guardian Space
A successful appeal by Zende Partners for Guardian commodities has led to the appointment of a technology broker at The Prospect, where Guardian modules are now available. The initiative has seen a marked increase in violence in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system, however, recently established as a hub of Guardian technological research.

Freya Taine, CEO of Zende Partners, made this announcement:

« Shortly after our company deployed a megaship transport service connecting Zende and Guardian space, our convoys came under attack. We have evidence to suggest that Segnen Exchange is responsible for this flagrant attempt to undermine our efforts. »

« I call upon the galactic community to assist Zende Partners in removing this threat to our operation. Our plans to begin production of an Advanced Multi-cannon can proceed once Segnen Exchange's disruptions have been dealt with. »

Cedrik Stone, CEO of Segnen Exchange, submitted this statement in response to the accusations:

« Zende Partners apparently intends to control the trade of Guardian commodities in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, which is perhaps why there is violent resistance to their operation. My company would only ever respond to threats with an appropriate level of self-defence. »

« In order to reestablish peace and protect our research into new Guardian-human technology, we ask independent pilots to support Segnen Exchange vessels in the system. Securing a permanent presence will allow my company to complete work on an Advanced Dumbfire Launcher on schedule. »

« Our newly established outpost, Indigo Dock, will serve as our base of operations in these efforts. »

The two factions have set out campaigns in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, to take place between the 23rd and 29th of May 3305.


* Mahon Demands End to Kincaid's Presidency
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has called on President Gibson Kincaid to step down pending an official inquiry.

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, Mahon said:

« President Kincaid's decision to assume direct command of the Zaonce fleet, coupled with allegations of illegal campaign funding, justify the suspension of his presidential term. »

« Kincaid is now being protected by Admiral Yamamoto's ships as well as emissaries from the Office of the Alliance President. This autocratic behaviour must cease, and Kincaid must cooperate with our investigation or face impeachment. »

President Kincaid issued a response from his private residence in Zaonce:

« These false accusations are further proof that the Alliance needs a single, strong leader. Unless the Assembly has irrefutable proof of illegality, the constitution states they cannot force me out of office. »


* Ship Thief Linked to Halsey's Visions
There has been much speculation about starship technician Gan Romero, whose dreams are believed to have directed him to steal a ship from a starport hangar.

On the Rewired network, independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse offered this analysis:

« Romero's dream journal entries were very similar to Jasmina Halsey's visions after the Starship One incident three years ago. Was this lowly grease monkey in touch with the same 'caretakers of our galaxy' that Halsey claims spoke to her? »

« Sure, it could be coincidence. Maybe even a shared psychological disorder. But it seems possible that Halsey and Romero were telepathically contacted by the same incorporeal intelligence. »

« You can see why they might want to talk to a Federal president. But a starport technician? What's so special about Romero? If he's telling the truth then who knows how many more ordinary people have heard these summons from 'bodiless voices' over the years? »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Conflict has broken out in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system following a series of attacks against convoys transporting Guardian commodities. Zende Partners, who recently established a research operation in the system aided by a megaship transport service, have claimed the violence was organised by Segnen Exchange. Both corporations have called on the galactic community to support their respective security campaigns.

In related news, the prior appeal by Zende Partners to install a technology broker at The Prospect in Synuefe EN-H d11-96 was successful. Guardian modules are now available for purchase at the outpost.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has called on President Gibson Kincaid to step down pending an official inquiry. Mahon has claimed that Kincaid's unauthorised command of the Alliance's Zaonce fleet, combined with recent claims of illegal campaign funding, is sufficient to suspend the presidency. Kincaid has dismissed the demands as unconstitutional.

And finally, commentators have linked ship thief Gan Romero's dream journal with the statements given by Jasmina Halsey following the disappearance of Starship One. The Rewired network claimed these 'bodiless voices' had disregarded the relative standing of these two individuals, and questioned how many others had experienced similar calls.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Zende Partners Claim Victory
The conflict in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system has ended with Zende Partners resisting an expansion attempt from Segnen Exchange.

Zende Partners CEO Freya Taine made the following declaration:

« With the support of the galactic community, my company has withstood the violent raids instigated by our rivals. Zende Partners will manage both outposts in the system, and the megaship transport service will continue operating on a weekly basis from Zende. »

« I am also proud to announce that we have begun manufacture of our new Advanced Multi-cannon at The Prospect, using recently acquired Guardian materials. »

In a subdued response, Cedrik Stone stated the following:

« Segnen Exchange has decided to withdraw from Synuefe EN-H d11-96 and focus our resources on previously established operations. While this setback has interfered with our research and development schedule, we will learn from this experience and continue to grow as a company. »

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect rewards from the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system. Supporters of Zende Partners must journey to The Prospect, while supporters of Segnen Exchange should visit Indigo Dock.


* Ship Thief Mystery Remains Unsolved
The investigation into technician Gan Romero, who stole a docked vessel from a hangar bay at Fort Dixon in the Vega system, has been officially suspended.

Security Chief Misaki Sanders made this statement:

« Apart from the remains of Romero's dream journal, we have no leads and have exhausted all avenues of inquiry. Attempts to track down the stolen ship have returned empty-handed. Until more evidence surfaces, we must reluctantly abandon our efforts. »

Commander Bjorn Lennox, the owner of the stolen ship, commented:

« Obviously I'm not happy about losing my Diamondback Explorer, and I've had to fight for the station's insurance to cover my losses. Still, part of me wonders if my ship was stolen for a reason\u2026 It was fitted for exploration with a high jump range, and it sounds like this guy was heading somewhere really far away. »

« They said Romero was delusional, right? Well, maybe he was just invited to a place that most people can't understand. I guess we'll never know. »


* Admiral Yamamoto Arrested for Murder
Admiral Frederick Yamamoto, head of the Alliance fleet in Zaonce, has been charged with the assassination of former presidential candidate Fazia Silva.

The shocking statement was delivered by Tashmira Silva, who became CEO of Silva Holdings Inc after her sister's death:

« When the inquiry into Fazia's murder closed, I hired the Wallglass Investigations Agency at great expense to uncover the truth. They identified that a professional assassin with a background in the Alliance Defence Force was responsible. »

« Unravelling a complex trail of financial evidence and encrypted communications led directly to Admiral Yamamoto. He personally arranged to have Fazia killed during the presidential election campaign, presumably to remove her political threat to his friend Gibson Kincaid. »

Alliance Interpol recently verified the Wallglass report and has now detained Yamamoto pending trial. The Zaonce fleet has been placed under the joint command of the Council of Admirals.

There has been no comment from President Kincaid.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Zende Partners has declared victory in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system following clashes with Segnen Exchange. CEO Freya Taine confirmed that her company would continue to operate the recently established megaship service and the system's two outposts. A new Advanced Multi-cannon has also been made available for purchase at The Prospect.

Admiral Frederick Yamamoto has been charged with the assassination of Fazia Silva. In a statement, Tashmira Silva revealed that a privately funded investigation has identified Yamamoto as responsible for arranging her sister's death during last year's presidential campaign. President Gibson Kincaid is yet to comment on the situation.

In other news, the investigation into technician Gan Romero has been suspended, with Fort Dixon investigators exhausting all known leads. The stolen ship's owner has speculated whether his exploration vessel was selected for a reason, given Romero's dream journal entries.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Sagittarius Eye Appeal
Sagittarius Eye has announced plans to construct an asteroid station in the Millese system.

A spokesperson for the faction provided the following statement:

« We've found a lovely asteroid in Millese that we can hollow out to build our print works in. We don't have a great deal of experience with building, but our intern has an engineering degree and tells us that we'll need specific materials. Bring us those and we'll reward you handsomely!\

In support of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order for cobalt, titanium and tantalum, with rewards available to pilots who deliver these commodities to McMullen Ring in the Millese system.

The campaign will take place between the 6th and 12th of June 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* President Kincaid's Conspiracy Exposed
The Alliance Tribune has revealed that Admiral Frederick Yamamoto has committed multiple crimes at the behest of Alliance president Gibson Kincaid.

In a detailed report, journalist Vanya Driscoll said:

« As part of a plea bargain to avoid life imprisonment, Yamamoto has provided Alliance Interpol with data regarding actions carried out on the direct orders of President Kincaid. »

« Along with the assassination of presidential candidate Fazia Silva, Yamamoto arranged to murder, injure and intimidate many others to facilitate Kincaid's rise to power. »

« The admiral coordinated his efforts with a number of influential corporate, military and political figures, who allied themselves with Kincaid in exchange for certain advantages. This included a Bank of Zaonce senior director, who illegally redirected funds to bankroll Kincaid's re-election campaign. »

« Kincaid's ultimate aim was to transfer executive power from Alioth to Zaonce, establishing a base of support to eventually become the supreme ruler of the Alliance. But with such a detailed and damning testimony from Yamamoto, it seems impossible that his presidency can survive these revelations. »


* Mass Purchase of Imperial Slaves
Tilbery Construction, a company based in the Eotienses system, has attracted attention following the purchase of four thousand Imperial slaves.

Garrett Kline, the company's CEO, explained:

« Tilbery Construction recently won a contract to build a new water treatment facility on Eotienses A 3, serving the city of Port Isabelle. We are a young company and have not yet acquired the personnel required to meet the ambitious deadline. An alternative workforce was therefore required. »

The anti-slavery charity Unchain has lodged a formal protest with authorities in Eotienses. A spokesperson told the media:

« Gathering a large number of Imperial slaves in one place brings enormous risk. Conditions are often poor when transporting people in such numbers, which would violate the terms of their indentured servitude. »

« We are also concerned with the lack of information regarding Tilbery Construction and Garrett Kline, who appears to have no experience managing such projects. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Admiral Frederick Yamamoto has revealed details of a conspiracy organised by President Gibson Kincaid to assume total control of the Alliance. As part of a plea bargain with prosecutors, Yamamoto confessed to a number of crimes committed on Kincaid's orders, including murder. The intent was to remove obstacles to Kincaid's acquisition of power.

A large number of Imperial slaves have been purchased by Tilbery Construction to work on a building project on Eotienses A 3. CEO Garrett Kline explained that the company lacks the personnel required to meet the project's deadline, and was therefore forced to seek an alternative workforce.

In other news, an appeal for materials has been issued by Sagittarius Eye. The faction plans to build a new starport within an excavated asteroid in the Millese system, and has called on the galactic community to support the endeavour.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Sagittarius Eye Appeal Concludes
A request for construction materials made by Sagittarius Eye has ended.

The appeal has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in an influx of deliveries to McMullen Ring, the organisation's base of operations. As a result, a new asteroid base named The Print Works has been established in the Millese system.

As the campaign drew to a close, the organisation's spokesperson issued the following statement:

\Thanks to all you delightful pilots, we now have a lovely new print works in Millese to produce the galaxy's finest magazine. We're absolutely thrilled, and everyone who helped is welcome to visit us in our new home.\

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from McMullen Ring in the Millese system.


* Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force Appeal
Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force has revealed plans to build a megaship in the Shana Bei system.

Archangel Evangeline, commander of the faction, made the following announcement:

« The successful construction of the megaship EFS Archangel will serve not only the Federation, but the entire galactic community. EFS Archangel will provide a hub for our military operations, allowing us to bring the fight to our enemies and defend imperilled systems. Together, we will make EFS Archangel a safe place to trade and share knowledge. Long live humanity!\

To ensure completion of the project, the organisation has requested superconductors, computer components and insulating membranes from the galactic community. Pilots who contribute these resources to the Force at Chu City in Shana Bei will be rewarded at the conclusion of the project.

The campaign will take place between the 13th and 19th of June 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* President Kincaid Impeached
President Gibson Kincaid has been removed from office after a majority vote in the Alliance Assembly, following charges of treason, murder and corruption. The date of his trial is expected to be confirmed soon.

Alliance Interpol confirmed that Kincaid was detained while attempting to flee his personal estate on Zaonce. A firefight broke out between Interpol agents and emissaries from the Office of the Alliance President, acting as Kincaid's personal bodyguards. Several fatalities were later confirmed.

A number of influential corporate and political figures who supported Kincaid's conspiracy to gain executive control of the Alliance have also been arrested, including a senior director at the Bank of Zaonce.

Prosecutions are expected to rely heavily on the recent testimony of Admiral Frederick Yamamoto and a detailed report provided by the Wallglass Investigations Agency.

Tashmira Silva, who privately commissioned the report, told the media:

« I am satisfied that Kincaid will at last face justice for his crimes, including my sister's murder. Fazia championed fairness, and succeeded as an entrepreneur by believing in others, she would be pleased to know that the Alliance has been purged of such a corrupt presence. »


* Imperial Slaves Freed by Activists
A company that purchased 4,000 Imperial slaves has revealed itself as a slavery emancipation group.

Using the name Tilbery Construction, the group claimed that the slave workforce would be used to build a water treatment facility for Port Isabelle, the capital of Eotienses A 3. Instead, the slaves were transported outside the city and set free.

The individual acting as the company's CEO, Garrett Kline, made the following statement:

« The true purpose of Tilbery Construction was to provide liberty. As members of the group Autonomy, we renounce institutionalised abuse and fight for human dignity. I am proud to say that we have returned four thousand enslaved people to freedom, so they may live their life however they wish. »

Autonomy is a network of radical activists opposed to the Empire's tradition of indentured servitude. It has forcibly liberated slaves on several prior occasions, but never on such a scale.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

President Gibson Kincaid has been removed from office and arrested following a majority impeachment vote. A number of corporate and political figures supporting Kincaid's plan to assume executive control of the Alliance have also been arrested. Tashmira Silva, who privately funded the investigation uncovering Kincaid's conspiracy, shared her satisfaction with the news.

A company who recently purchased 4,000 Imperial slaves for a construction project in the Eotienses system has revealed itself as a slavery emancipation group. The leader of the group, Garrett Kline, declared their affiliation with the radical anti-slavery activists known as Autonomy. The slaves have been freed outside of Port Isabelle, the capital of Eotienses A 3.

In other news, Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force has announced plans to build a megaship in the Shana Bei system. Archangel Evangeline, the faction's commander, has invited the galactic community to contribute materials to the undertaking in exchange for financial reward.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force Appeal Ends
An appeal for materials from Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force has concluded successfully.

Following coordinated efforts by the galactic community, a large number of deliveries were completed to Chu City in Shana Bei. The new megaship, EFS Archangel, has now been completed and is currently undergoing final quality checks from the technicians involved.

The group's commander, Archangel Evangeline, provided the following statement:

« Our command group is preparing the EFS Archangel for her shakedown cruise through the system. On behalf of Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force, we salute the galactic community for its support and generous efforts. Without their assistance, this would not have been possible. »

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Chu City in the Shana Bei system.


* Alliance President Role Abolished
The Alliance Assembly has permanently dissolved the role of President of the Alliance, following the recent revelations about Gibson Kincaid's multiple crimes.

Summarising the vote, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon said:

« Recent events have made it clear that the presidential position is open to misuse, which places the integrity of the Alliance at risk. Following a thorough debate on the matter, this Assembly has voted \u2013 by an overwhelming majority \u2013 to remove the role from our constitution. »

« The defunct Office of the Alliance President will now be restructured. Many emissaries will be retained to serve as the non-political ambassadors they were intended to be. Councillor Elijah Beck has volunteered to resign in order to oversee the new department. »

« We hope that this unfortunate chapter of Alliance history has now been brought to an end. »

An earlier vote held during the same session has selected Admiral Tahir West of the Tionisla fleet to join the Council of Admirals, replacing the disgraced Frederick Yamamoto.


* Imperial Slaves Stranded
Four thousand Imperial slaves have been left stranded on Eotienses A 3 after being forcibly freed by emancipation group Autonomy.

Independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash reported for Vox Galactica:

« Since being set free outside Port Isabelle, the former slaves have been without food, shelter or income. Many complain that they cannot return home without completing their indentured servitude to pay off debts or fulfil contracts. »

« In desperation, thousands of newly homeless have poured into the city. Many public buildings, such as the Imperial Museum of Culture, have been turned into makeshift camps, with large numbers also begging on the streets. »

« Police and support services are struggling to cope with the unexpected influx of immigrants. Already there have been several clashes between citizens and the emancipated, and such incidents are likely to escalate until a solution is found. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The role of President of the Alliance has been abolished following a majority vote in the Alliance Assembly. Prime Minister Mahon stated that the move was intended to prevent any further abuse of power, given Gibson Kincaid's recently uncovered crimes. The same assembly session also named Admiral Tahir West as the newest member of the Council of Admirals.

4,000 former Imperial slaves have poured into Port Isabelle, the capital of Eotienses A 3, after being forcibly freed by activist group Autonomy. The emancipated individuals have made camp in a number of public buildings, begging for food and credits. There have also been reports of clashes with local residents.

In other news, an appeal for materials from Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force has concluded successfully. A new megaship, EFS Archangel, has finished construction and is now operational in orbit around Shana Bei 6.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Aisling Duval Condemns Autonomy Group
Anti-slavery charity Unchain has criticised the radical activist group Autonomy for liberating 4,000 Imperial slaves on Eotienses A 3.

Princess Aisling Duval, the charity's patron, told the media:

« I fully appreciate Garrett Kline's desire to free slaves, which I'm sure comes from a place of genuine empathy, but I feel I must condemn his methods. Autonomy's reckless actions have left thousands stranded in Port Isabelle without employment or protection. »

« Unchain has run similar operations to give illegal slaves their freedom, but licensed Imperial slaves require more care. The manumission process must be managed legally by a registered organisation, and each individual's wellbeing ensured. You cannot simply set huge numbers of people loose as if they were zoo animals being released into the wild. »

« My dream is that one day the Empire will abolish the indentured servitude system, and that every form of slavery will end. But until then, all emancipation efforts must operate within the law. »

The situation in Port Isabelle remains tense, with thousands of emancipated individuals still clustered around makeshift shelters and occupied public buildings, begging for food and credits.


* Red Family Leader Surrenders
Jan Sandoval, a known founder of the infamous Red Family drug cartel, has unexpectedly handed herself in to the Federal Intelligence Agency.

Executive Agent Viola Trask gave a summary of this development:

« It's not unheard of for criminals to present themselves at FIA headquarters in Olympus Village, but Sandoval is by far the most notorious individual to do so. »

« Sandoval has stated that she is willing to testify against all prominent members of the cartel, an action that would effectively dismantle it. She has been placed in protective custody, and I will be personally handling her case. »

The Red Family is a well-established syndicate that supplies illegal narcotics across multiple systems. Within its hierarchy, Sandoval is believed to be second only to kingpin Oberon Church, who is among the most wanted criminals in the Federation.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Princess Aisling Duval, patron of the anti-slavery charity Unchain, has criticised activist group Autonomy for freeing thousands of slaves on Eotienses A 3. While sympathising with leader Garrett Kline's motives, Duval condemned the lack of proper care or long-term consideration for the newly emancipated individuals.

A leader of the notorious Red Family drug cartel, Jan Sandoval, has handed herself in to the Federal Intelligence Agency. Reports suggest she plans to testify against all prominent cartel members, including kingpin Oberon Church. Sandoval has been placed into protective custody, and Executive Agent Viola Trask has been assigned ownership of the case.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Distant Worlds Megaship and Station Operational
A new research megaship and relay station constructed by the Distant Worlds II exploratory fleet have become operational.

Project leader Erimus Kamzel made a statement on behalf of those involved in the expedition:

« We are very proud to announce the launch of the DSSV Distant Worlds megaship, dedicated to the DW II fleet who built it. We look forward to its maiden voyage as it embarks on a journey of scientific study around the galactic core. »

The DSSV Distant Worlds will follow a circular route between six systems in the Galactic Centre region, with scheduled hyperspace jumps every two weeks. It is currently based at Explorer's Anchorage.

The relay station, Event Horizon, has also become operational in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system. This installation will gather scientific data on the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, and provide research facilities and residence for scientists at the heart of the galaxy.


* Meta-Alloys Reportedly Growing Scarce
Aegis Research has issued a statement amid growing concerns that meta-alloy harvests in the Pleiades Nebula have slowed dramatically. A number of sources claim that Thargoid barnacle sites have recently ceased producing materials.

The situation was addressed by Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research:

« Thargoid structures remain poorly understood, so we can only theorise why the barnacles in most Pleiades systems have grown barren. Our leading hypothesis is that these sites have been over-exploited in recent years, and humanity has simply exhausted this resource. »

« What is certain is that meta-alloys are both a valuable commodity and a vital component of anti-xeno technology. It is of paramount importance that we maintain the supply of this material. »

« Therefore, Aegis Research is spearheading an initiative to identify an alternative source. We ask the galactic community to support us by providing exploration data, in the hope this leads us to undiscovered barnacle sites. »

Independent pilots who wish to participate can do so by handing in survey scans at The Oracle in the Delphi system between the 4th and the 10th of July.


* Hit Squad Targets Cartel Leader
The Federal Intelligence Agency headquarters in Olympus Village has been infiltrated by a mercenary unit attempting to murder Jan Sandoval, one of the Red Family cartel's founders.

Executive Agent Viola Trask gave an account to the press:

« This was an extraordinary breach of the FIA's most secure location. The mercenaries were highly trained professionals carrying false identification to bypass initial checks.«

« It's clear that they were targeting Sandoval, who is currently in protective custody at FIA headquarters. Fortunately, our security systems exposed the intruders before they could reach her, and the threat was swiftly neutralised. »

« This assassination attempt reinforces our belief that the information Sandoval offers is not only genuine but also a legitimate threat to the Red Family's existence. Interviews with Sandoval are ongoing, and we are reviewing her testimony in detail. »


* Further Disorder at Port Isabelle
Thousands of forcibly freed Imperial slaves have continued to create turmoil in the capital city of Eotienses A 3.

Vox Galactica featured an on-site report by independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash:

« Three weeks after being liberated by the radical activist group Autonomy, the emancipated have banded together in their desperation for survival. Many now wield makeshift weapons gathered from the streets.\

\One large group invaded Port Isabelle's spaceport, causing major disruption to flights. There were scenes of conflict when they attempted to hijack the very ships originally used by Autonomy to transport them.\

\Others have besieged government buildings, demanding to be officially enslaved again so they can complete their terms of servitude. Many emancipated individuals still beg on the streets, despite charitable donations by some citizens.\

\With welfare resources overwhelmed by the immigrants, it can only be a matter of time before more drastic solutions are attempted. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Aegis Research has announced a new initiative to locate a new primary source of meta-alloys. The news came alongside the confirmation that the Pleiades Nebula barnacle sites have been exhausted, possibly due to over-exploitation by humanity. The galactic community has been asked to provide exploration data as part of the search.

In other news, The Federal Intelligence Agency has prevented an assassination attempt on Jan Sandoval within their own headquarters in Olympus Village. Sandoval, founder of the Red Family drug cartel, is currently in protective custody at the building after unexpectedly handing herself in to Federal agents.

Unrest at Port Isabelle has continued to grow, following the forced emancipation of Imperial slaves by activist group Autonomy. Many of the freed individuals have besieged government buildings, demanding to be returned to slavery so they can fulfil their former contracts.

And finally, a research megaship and relay station constructed by the Distant Worlds II exploratory fleet have become operational. The DSSV Distant Worlds is scheduled to follow a circular six-system route in the Galactic Centre region, while relay station Event Horizon will gather scientific data on Sagittarius A*.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Alternative Source of Meta-Alloys Identified
The Witch Head Nebula has been confirmed as a primary source of meta-alloys, following an initiative hosted by Aegis Research. The news has triggered efforts to swiftly establish a human presence in the area.

Aegis Research released this statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:

\Having analysed large amounts of exploration data, graciously provided by the galactic community, we can confirm that the Witch Head Nebula contains enough barnacle sites to meet the demand for meta-alloys. I am confident that these sites will offer a suitable alternative to the exhausted barnacles in the Pleiades Nebula.\

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have already dispatched advance teams to the region. Each superpower has asked the galactic community to support its respective initiative and help them establish megaships and Ocellus starports in the nebula.

With the Pleiades sources of meta-alloys now almost completely depleted, independent traders will play a key role in ensuring that this vital commodity remains available to humanity.

Pilots seeking to participate in any of the three initiatives will be able to find further information on the nearest mission board.


* Thargoids Withdraw from Core Systems
Reports indicate that the Thargoids have abruptly withdrawn from the majority of human-occupied space.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, announced:

« Multiple reliable sources have reported a mass departure of Thargoid craft. Their forces vanished from dozens of locations within hours of each other. Only the Maia and Merope systems are still reporting Thargoid activity. »

« Our theory is that the Thargoids have retreated due to our defence operations depleting their numbers. Then again, they may simply be reconsidering their strategy. Either way, Aegis will continue to monitor the situation. »

In response, Professor Ishmael Palin of the Palin Research Centre offered words of warning:

« Celebrating any kind of victory over the Thargoids would be premature. We have no proof that their withdrawal was a result of human activity, and this action is at odds with their highly territorial nature. Nevertheless, this is still a significant \u2013 if mysterious \u2013 development. »


* Cartel Leader Exposes New Narcotic Menace
Jan Sandoval, a founder of the Red Family cartel, has revealed why she surrendered to the Federal Intelligence Agency.

According to Executive Agent Viola Trask, Sandoval has provided proof that the Red Family has developed a new designer narcotic, genetically engineered to be far more addictive than all other substances traded on the black market.

« It's clear that such a narcotic would ruin billions of lives throughout Federal space, » said Trask. « Sandoval sees herself as a businesswoman, not a mass murderer. Such an operation is incompatible with her principles. »

« Sandoval also explained that she failed to prevent cartel kingpin Oberon Church from manufacturing the new product, leaving her with no choice but to request help from the proper authorities. For this, I commend her. »

« Using additional details contained within this testimony, FIA field agents are already engaged in disrupting Red Family operations. We are confident that we can finally bring down this notorious criminal empire. »


* IISS Detains Former Imperial Slaves
The Imperial Internal Security Service has moved to apprehend the Imperial slaves who were forcibly emancipated on Eotienses A 3.

Captain Madoc Evander made this announcement:

« An IISS taskforce was despatched to Port Isabelle to address the civil disorder arising from the release of 4,000 Imperial slaves, freed without financial support or recognised status. The troops successfully located all the liberated individuals and detained them in temporary holding areas. »

« We have also arrested members of the radical group Autonomy for their role in this situation. Their spokesperson, Garrett Kline, has been charged with manslaughter, having crushed several rioting ex-slaves with his ship while attempting to escape the area. »

« I'm pleased to report that any damage caused within the city is under repair, and disrupted services are resuming. As yet we are uncertain how to process the emancipated, but discussions with Port Isabelle authorities and other parties are underway. »

Aegis Research has announced that the Witch Head Nebula is a viable alternative source of meta-alloys. Professor Alba Tesreau confirmed that the survey data provided by the galactic community allowed her team to identify this area as a prime source of Thargoid barnacle sites. The Alliance, Empire and Federation have all initiated plans to establish a presence in the area.

The Thargoids have withdrawn from human-occupied space. Multiple sources have corroborated reports that Thargoid craft have disappeared from almost all systems, with only Maia and Merope as exceptions. Speculation continues as to the reason for this development.

In other news, Jan Sandoval has provided proof that the Red Family cartel she co-founded intends to begin circulation of a new, highly addictive narcotic. The substance poses such a danger to Federal space that Sandoval felt compelled to seek the assistance of the Federal Intelligence Agency to prevent its distribution.

And finally, the Imperial Internal Security Service has stepped in to detain the forcibly emancipated slaves running riot in Port Isabelle. Members of the anti-slavery group Autonomy have also been arrested for initiating the turmoil, including ringleader Garrett Kline.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Thargoids Return to Pleiades Nebula
The Thargoids have returned to the Pleiades Nebula in large numbers, with several conflicts reported within hours.

Professor Alba Tesreau gave an update on behalf of Aegis Research:

« The Thargoid forces that recently withdrew from the core systems have resurfaced in the Pleiades Nebula following a brief disappearance. An initial analysis of their movements suggests a subtle change to their tactics. I believe they are seeking to reassert themselves in their original nexus. »

« A considerable number of Thargoid craft have gathered in the Maia system. With the Palin Research Centre facing an imminent attack, the decision was made to evacuate Professor Palin and his staff, thereby protecting a number of vital research projects. All work at Palin Research Centre has been suspended. »

« Regrettably, however, a transmission from Palin's megaship, Carson's Spring, indicates that it was assaulted by Thargoid vessels shortly after departure. With system security forces already under pressure, we urge independent pilots to head to Maia and protect Carson's Spring. »


* Red Family Cartel Raids Successful
The Red Family cartel has suffered enormous losses following a series of strikes carried out by the Federal Intelligence Agency.

Crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi summarised his report in The Federal Times:

« In a coordinated operation spanning multiple systems, FIA troops raided hidden Red Family bases and manufacturing plants. Dozens of cartel members were killed in combat and thousands more arrested, while vast amounts of illegal substances were seized. »

The narcotics kingpin Oberon Church spent decades establishing his empire, but with such catastrophic losses it has been virtually dismantled. Members of Federal Congress have congratulated the FIA for 'removing this blight on Federal society'.

Executive Agent Viola Trask suggested that « this success was only possible due to the detailed information volunteered by Jan Sandoval, one of the Red Family's founders. » It is widely assumed that Church's arrest will follow soon, effectively eliminating the cartel.


* Unchain Purchases Imperial Slaves
The anti-slavery charity Unchain has officially purchased the 4,000 Imperial slaves who were forcibly freed on Eotienses A 3.

Princess Aisling Duval, the charity's patron, gave the following statement to the press:

« The contracts of all those liberated against their will have been acquired by Unchain. They will be properly cared for while they work to build a new Unchain headquarters in Port Isabelle. This will allow them to pay off their debts and become free citizens once more. »

When pressed further by journalists, Princess Aisling offered a wry smile along with her explanation:

« I'm well aware of the irony of an anti-slavery organisation hiring Imperial slaves. We do this only to prevent further suffering at Port Isabelle and undo some of the damage caused by Autonomy. Allow me to specify that this is a practical solution to a problem of the Empire's own making. »

« The indentured servitude system may seem honourable, but \u2013 as recent events prove \u2013 it leaves people vulnerable to abuse and neglect. Unchain remains dedicated to replacing the barbaric practice of slavery with more civilised welfare and employment programmes. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Thargoids have returned to the Pleiades Nebula in significant numbers, leading to speculation that they are looking to reassert themselves in their original nexus. The threat to the Palin Research Centre has led to the evacuation of Professor Palin and his staff. Palin's megaship, Carson's Spring, was attacked in the Maia system soon after.

The Red Family cartel has been crippled following a series of coordinated strikes, which resulted in thousands of arrests and the closure of narcotic-production facilities. The success of the operation was attributed to information provided by Red Family co-founder Jan Sandoval, although cartel kingpin Oberon Church remains at large.

In other news, anti-slavery charity Unchain has officially purchased the 4,000 Imperial slaves emancipated against their will on Eotienses A 3. Charity patron Princess Aisling Duval stressed that the slaves would be well cared for, stating the transaction was simply a practical solution to an Imperial-made problem.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Carson's Spring Reaches Arque System
Carson's Spring, the megaship transporting Professor Ishmael Palin from the Maia system, has successfully completed its journey, having endured a number of attacks by Thargoid craft.

Admiral Aden Tanner provided this update on behalf of Aegis Research:

« With support from many independent combat pilots, the Thargoid assaults on Carson's Spring have been successfully repelled. »

« The megaship has now arrived in the Arque system with Professor Palin and his staff. »

Palin currently remains aboard Carson's Spring. Efforts are underway to establish a new permanent home at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E, from where Palin's previously offered engineering services can resume.


* Thargoids Defend Meta-Alloy Sources
The Thargoids have emerged in the Witch Head Nebula, just hours after human expansion efforts in the region began. Numerous attacks in the area indicate that Thargoid craft are aggressively defending the region's barnacle sites.

Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research said in an update:

« Representative factions of the Alliance, Empire and Federation have entered the Witch Head Nebula to begin colonisation efforts. A number of megaships and Ocellus starports arrived in the area on schedule, only to be met with hostile Thargoid vessels soon afterwards. »

This development, coupled with increased Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula, suggests that the Thargoids are intent on driving humanity out of regions containing barnacle sites. Tesreau was quick to repeat that securing access to a source of meta-alloys is of great importance to humanity.

« All three superpowers are urgently requesting help to repel Thargoid forces from the Witch Head Nebula, » said Tesreau. « Without the galactic community's support, these pioneer factions will be forced to retreat, and vital supplies of meta-alloys will be lost. »


* Cartel Leader Killed
Jan Sandoval, co-founder of the Red Family cartel, has died while in the custody of the Federal Intelligence Agency.

Executive Agent Viola Trask made the following statement:

« I regret to announce that Jan Sandoval has been found dead in the safe house where she was being held. An autopsy revealed traces of a highly sophisticated neurotoxin that our security measures were unable to detect. »

« We have yet to determine how the neurotoxin was administered, or how the individual responsible accessed the safe house. Internal investigations are underway, but we suspect that the assassin has already fled the Sol system. »

It is believed that surviving elements of the Red Family arranged this second, successful attempt on Sandoval's life in response to her cooperation with the Federal Intelligence Agency. The FIA's operation against the cartel will continue, but the loss of its primary intelligence source has to be considered a significant setback.


* Alliance Festival of Culture Begins
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has announced the start of the Alliance Festival of Culture, a series of events taking place across seven systems.

The Alliance Tribune's cultural correspondent Corinne Macintyre provided a summary of the festival:

« This seven-week tour of Alliance space will begin at the Fine Art Emporium on Lave. We have been promised that a wide range of artistic achievements, entertainment and history will be highlighted. »

« Naturally, the Tribune will be offering in-depth coverage over the course of the festival. »

The prime minister was visibly pleased to introduce the Alliance Festival of Culture, describing it as « a celebration to lift citizens' spirits in these challenging times ». It has been speculated that Mahon is hoping to move forward from the recent political scandals involving Gibson Kincaid.

The centrepiece of the opening ceremony was a tribute to Megan Madigan, widely considered one of the most significant visual artists of the late 33rd Century. Her most famous work, titled 'Penance Street', was tragically lost in transit sixty years ago. The much-loved painting was honoured by modern reinterpretations from dozens of Lave's finest artists.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Thargoid forces have entered the Witch Head Nebula in response to human colonisation efforts in the area. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research has urged independent pilots to engage Thargoid vessels in the nebula and ensure that the superpowers can establish bases close to nearby meta-alloy sites.

In related news, Professor Palin has successfully relocated with his team to the Arque system. Palin's megaship, Carson's Spring, was able to fend off a number of Thargoid assaults and complete its scheduled journey. Palin's team is currently working to establish a permanent base of operations in the system.

Jan Sandoval, co-founder of the Red Family cartel, has been found dead in a Federal Intelligence Agency safe house. Autopsy reports confirm that a highly specialised neurotoxin was the cause of death. No suspects have been detained, but it is believed that the remaining Red Family leadership arranged the assassination.

And finally, the Alliance Festival of Culture has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon. The festival will tour a number of Allied systems over the next seven weeks, highlighting a range of artistic and cultural achievements.

And those are the main stories this week.


* A New Home for Professor Palin
Professor Ishmael Palin has established a permanent base of operations in the Arque system.

Aegis Research confirmed the news with a statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:

« Having fled the Maia system, Professor Palin and his staff have installed their equipment at the planetary port Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E. »

« All of the engineering services previously offered by Professor Palin are now available at his new location. His study of meta-alloys and other Thargoid-related materials has also resumed. »

« The megaship Carson's Spring, which facilitated an emergency evacuation of the Palin Research Centre, has left the Arque system to resume other duties. »


* Enclave Established in Witch Head Nebula
Recent reports from the Witch Head Nebula indicate that the Thargoid forces in the region have been defeated. The initial call to arms from Aegis Research was met with an overwhelming response from independent pilots, who were able to push back Thargoid incursions from the new human colonies.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, said:

« Humanity has achieved a decisive victory in the Witch Head Nebula. Significant numbers of Thargoid vessels were destroyed in the conflict, even as many independent pilots were lost. But the sacrifice of these brave souls was not in vain, for the enemy has been forced to withdraw. »

« While the threat of occasional incursions from Thargoid craft remains, our colonial assets have been firmly established in the region. »

Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research looked to the future:

« The Alliance, Empire and Federation have declared that the Witch Head Nebula is now an official enclave of humanity \u2013 a region that their joint efforts have enabled them to share equally. »

« But the damage inflicted on our new starports must be repaired before we can harvest the barnacle sites in the area. Independent pilots have already given so much, and for that I am humbled and thankful. And yet, we must ask for one last favour: to support the repair of these starports. »


* Red Family Operation Concludes
The Federal Intelligence Agency has declared that its campaign against the Red Family cartel is drawing to a close.

As observed by Ethan Takahashi, crime correspondent for The Federal Times:

« In terms of effective action, this has to be considered a great victory for the FIA. A series of coordinated strikes against the Red Family delivered a mortal blow, and the cartel's super-addictive narcotic was destroyed before it could be mass-produced. »

« While kingpin Oberon Church remains at liberty, it is unlikely that he could ever rebuild his empire. Still, losing one of the most wanted criminals in the Federation must be frustrating for the agency. »

Internal investigations continue regarding Jan Sandoval's death in custody. No conclusive evidence has been uncovered, but many believe that Sandoval could not be reached without the assistance of FIA personnel.

« It is not unreasonable to assume that individuals within the FIA have been bought by Church, » said Takahashi.


* Lave Citizens Comment on Festival
As the first week of the Alliance Festival of Culture draws to a close, Lave residents have shared mixed feelings about the decision to stage the opening ceremony in their home system.

« Clearly this was a political gesture from Edmund Mahon, » said Grady Chen, an independent journalist speaking at Lave Station. « An independent faction rules Lave now. There was military conflict here just last year. Yet we have Alliance leaders trying to garner support despite losing control of the system. It's blatant propaganda. »

Sarai Messemer, a financial consultant, offered a different opinion when interviewed in The Orange Sidewinder. « Lave has been an Alliance system for decades. We lived by the Alliance's ethos for a couple of generations, y'know? Sure, we've got Lave Radio in control of the system now but that doesn't change who we are, or what makes us Lavians. »

A spokesperson for Lave Radio, Dr Allen Stroud, provided the following statement.

\It was quite a surprise that the organisers decided to open the festival in Lave, but I guess they see things the same way we do. We're all just trying to get along and there's much to celebrate about the Alliance, regardless of whether your system is a current or former member. »

« I'm looking forward to Lave welcoming as many visitors as possible. Come for the festival, the brandy, the radio station or one of our many other attractions, and we'd be delighted to host you. »


* Controversy at Film Festival
The Leesti system played host to the second week of the Alliance Festival of Culture, where a new film production has caused minor controversy.

The Alliance Tribune's cultural correspondent Corinne Macintyre offered these details:

« A grand celebration of cinematic art took place at George Lucas station, featuring a wide range of traditional and interactive media from dozens of systems. »

« The talking point was undoubtedly 'Unity', a historical drama from award-winning director Hal Raskin. It portrays Alliance founders Mic Turner and Meredith Argent as rivals who faked their romance to rally political support. »

« More traditionalist audiences \u2013 and not a few critics \u2013 took issue with the suggestion that the couple's love was fraudulent, while others applauded it as bold and challenging. But this lively debate did nothing to dampen spirits at the event, which drew appreciative crowds. »

The Alliance Festival of Culture is scheduled to continue over the next five weeks.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Thargoid forces in the Witch Head Nebula have been defeated. A call to arms from Aegis Research received a considerable response from independent pilots, leading to a victory for humanity. The official establishment of a human enclave in the Witch Head Nebula was declared shortly afterwards. Professor Alba Tesreau has asked the galactic community to assist with station repairs in the area.

Professor Palin and his staff have finished installing equipment at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E. The engineering services formerly available at the Palin Research Centre are now available in the Arque system, along with any modules held in Palin's storage facility.

The Alliance Festival of Culture focused on the Leesti system this week. A celebration of cinematic art was held at George Lucas station, featuring a wide range of traditional and interactive media.

In related news, the decision to stage the Alliance Festival of Culture opening ceremony in Lave has drawn a mixed reaction from residents. Supporters highlighted Lave's decades-old membership of the Alliance, while critics have called the ceremony a political gesture aimed at the ruling independent faction.

And finally, the Federal Intelligence Agency's campaign against the Red Family cartel has drawn to a close. While seen as a successful operation, kingpin Oberon Church remains at large. Investigations continue regarding cartel co-founder Jan Sandoval's death while in FIA custody.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Further Migration to Witch Head Nebula
The human enclave in the Witch Head Nebula has attracted thousands of migrants looking for a fresh start.

One of those heading to the area is Chloe Sedesi, a former apprentice of Professor Ishmael Palin. She gave an interview to Leon Banerjee for Vox Galactica:

« I've been working with the professor for years now, and he's taught me so much about rejigging modules to improve their function. He might come across as a bit serious, but Ishmael's actually a total sweetheart. Although he'll probably frown at me for saying that. »

« I'd been thinking about striking out on my own for a while, and the creation of the Witch Head enclave seemed like a good opportunity to do just that. All those independent pilots have done so much for the new enclave, I thought it'd be good to offer a little support. »

Sedesi is currently overseeing the installation of a facility at Cinder Dock in Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17, which will offer engineering services similar to those previously offered at the Palin Research Centre.

It has also been confirmed that a tech broker and a material trader will be offering their services in the Witch Head Nebula, once the region's starports have been returned to full functionality.


* Witch Head Planetary Ports Established
Humanity's expansion into the Witch Head Nebula has continued with the introduction of seven planetary ports.

Six ports now occupy systems surrounding the existing enclave. The Alliance, Federation and Empire have each established two ports, strengthening the presence of their representative factions.

The seventh port, Cinder Dock, is located in Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research provided some additional details:

« A facility managed by the engineer Chloe Sedesi has been installed at Cinder Dock. The engineering blueprints available at the facility offer upgrades to frame shift drives and thrusters. »

« Following last-minute discussions held aboard the megaship Spirit of Minue, a tech broker and material trader have also agreed to bring their services to the planetary ports. These contacts are located at Bray Landing and Ratchet Hub respectively. »

« With these new resources available ahead of schedule, we hope to accelerate the ongoing efforts to repair the starports damaged during recent Thargoid assaults. Ezra Point is the first to declare itself fully functional, with all standard services back online. »

Further installations have been planned over the coming weeks, as migration continues to bring new opportunities and financial investment to the enclave.

« These achievements are founded on the tireless efforts of many independent pilots, » said Tesreau. « Their bravery and dedication were key factors in securing humanity's access to meta-alloys within the Witch Head Nebula. On behalf of Aegis, I offer these pilots my deepest gratitude. »


* The Greatest Gig in the Galaxy
The Alliance Festival of Culture enters its third week with a massive music festival in the Phekda system drawing thousands of attendees. Organisers are calling the event 'the greatest gig in the galaxy'.

Corinne Macintyre, cultural correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported:

« The programme is certainly diverse, encompassing everything from megastars like Spectacular Nemesis and Jade Graceland to up-and-comers such as The Lasting Hold. »

« Meanwhile, for those whose knowledge of contemporary music stops with Mahler, the Topaz Philharmonic is one of several orchestras performing this week. »

« But the big news is that legendary singer-songwriter Xiona is coming out of retirement for a special one-off performance. »

The Alliance Festival of Culture will continue for a further four weeks.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

Expansion of the Witch Head enclave has continued with the installation of seven planetary ports. Focus has turned to supporting the influx of new colonists, now that access to meta-alloys in the region has been secured. It is hoped that the new ports will accelerate ongoing efforts to repair the starports damaged in recent Thargoid attacks.

In related news, new engineer Chloe Sedesi has opened for business at one of the new planetary facilities, Cinder Dock. Sedesi's services have been complemented by a tech broker and material trader, available at Bray Landing and Ratchet Hub respectively.

Finally, the Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its third week with a music festival in the Phekda system, which organisers have called 'the greatest gig in the galaxy'. The line-up includes a mix of established and new talent, with a one-off performance by legendary artist Xiona considered the highlight.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Food Delivery Initiative in the Chamas System
The Fortunes Corsairs faction has organised an initiative to transport food commodities to the Chamas system.

A fundraising event has been organised as part of efforts to greenlight the construction of a new asteroid base. Many of the system's elected officials are expected to attend the grand feast, prepared by the most eminent chefs in Chamas.

Silas James, representing the Chamash Foods conglomerate, announced:

\We feel that nothing but the finest foodstuffs from the Inner Orion Spur should be on hand for this momentous occasion. Couriers are invited to play their part in helping the region towards an era of prosperity. »

A request has been made for independent traders to deliver fruit and vegetables, fish, grain and synthetic meat to Denton Dock in the Chamas system.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 15th to the 21st August 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Fiction Fans Gather for Literary Event
A celebration of literature at H.G. Wells Terminal in the Olgrea system is the focus of the fourth week of the Alliance Festival of Culture.

Leyton Farris reported on the event for The Alliance Tribune:

« Devotees of both modern and classic fiction have gathered to celebrate a shared love of literature and meet their favourite authors. The event is also an opportunity for writers to promote their work and attract new readers. »

« One highlight has been local author Hanna Darrold releasing a novel titled 'Chronicles of Olgrea'. The book concerns a local author releasing a novel during a literature festival, and has become an instant bestseller in the metafiction category. »

Fans of the wildly popular Corsair King series expressed hope for an appearance by Olav Redcourt, but he remains in seclusion working on his science fiction novel. A spokesperson for Bonespire Publishing suggested « Redcourt is risking financial ruin by trying to resuscitate a dead genre \u2013 nobody reads science fiction anymore. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Alliance Festival of Culture has entered the Olgrea system this week with a celebration of literature. Fans of both modern and classical fiction gathered to discuss their favourite novels and meet popular authors.

The Fortunes Corsairs faction has organised an initiative to transport food commodities to the Chamas system. A fundraiser supporting efforts to construct an asteroid base in the system is scheduled for next week, with a grand feast advertised as the main attraction.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Starship Enterprises Launches Mining Campaign
The Starship Enterprises faction has issued a public request for mined resources.

SE Mining, a subdivision of Starship Enterprises, requires materials to construct a specialised installation in the LP 339-7 system. The proposed starport will serve as a departmental headquarters while also providing services to travellers in the region.

Dr Lewis Chapman, CEO of Starship Enterprises, announced:

« There has long been a rift between our system's prosperous inner worlds and the less wealthy outer gas giants. SE Mining will bridge this divide with a new asteroid base among the rings of the fourth planet, which will generate trade to benefit the entire system. »

« SE Mining has been the backbone of my company since its inception. It has seen us through hard times and continues to be one of the corporation's most important assets. I believe a new base of operations is a fine way to reward the division's hard work. »

Independent pilots are asked to mine quantities of osmium, samarium, uraninite, monazite and platinum for delivery to Gell-Mann Ring in the LP 339-7 system.

The initiative will run from the 22nd to the 28th of August 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Food Delivery Initiative Concludes Successfully
A campaign to deliver food commodities to the Chamas system has been declared a success by its organisers.

The Fortunes Corsairs efforts to acquire various foods for a glamorous reception were well received. The event, attended by various system officials, appears to have achieved its aim.

Silas James of the Chamash Foods conglomerate released the following statement:

« Due to the overwhelming support from Fortunes Corsairs and other independent traders, the delicious feast helped make our fundraiser a tremendous success. Construction of the new asteroid base will begin immediately. »

Contributors to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Denton Dock in the Chamas system.


* Tionisla Hosts Theatre and Dance Gala
The Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its fifth week, focusing on a wide variety of theatre and dance performances.

Crowds have flocked to New Caledonia in the Tionisla system to enjoy performance art from dozens of systems. Shows ranging from elaborate stage productions to amateur street recitals have offered classical operas, circus shows, theatrical plays and much more.

Art critic Bryony Lindholm published this review on Vox Galactica:

« While the entertainment on display has been nothing short of marvellous, a personal favourite has been the ballet 'Bones of Dreams'. It is performed by skeletal robot dancers made of scrap salvaged from the Tionisla orbital graveyard. »

« It is a moving portrayal of inhumanity, and like most of the audience, I was left in tears despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the absence of any sentient organisms depicting grand themes of grief and loss. »

The Alliance Festival of Culture continues next week in Alioth and will feature a presentation at the Garden City Gallery.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Alliance Festival of Culture's fifth week has focused on theatre and dance. Crowds travelling to New Caledonia in the Tionisla system have enjoyed a wide variety of performance art shows, ranging from full stage productions to amateur street acts.

The Fortunes Corsairs faction has announced a successful conclusion to their appeal for food deliveries in the Chamas system. A new starport has been built in Chamas, following the well-received grand feast attended by many government officials.

Finally, the Starship Enterprises faction has issued a public request for mined resources. The intent is to build a new asteroid base in the LP 339-7 system, which would serve as a portal for increased trade and industrial operations for residents.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Sap Core Legion Commodity Drive
The Sap Core Legion faction has launched an initiative to build a state-of-the-art medical facility in the Heike system.

Heike has some significance in the field of medicine \u2013 a species of tea plant native to the system played a vital role in the development of a cure for the Cerberus Plague. Sap Core Legion believes that this detail makes Heike an ideal location for the new installation.

Professor Macklin Fox, speaking on behalf of Sap Core Legion, said:

\Sap Core Legion wishes to build this facility in response to a number of recent outbreaks and epidemics. When one also considers the current Thargoid conflict, we feel humanity would benefit from additional off-world medical resources. »

Independent pilots have been invited to deliver advanced medicines, thallium and medical diagnostic equipment to Braun Enterprise in the Heike system.

The initiative is scheduled to run from August 29th to September 4th 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Starship Enterprises Mining Campaign Concludes
A mining initiative by the Starship Enterprises faction has ended successfully, with the establishment of a new asteroid base in the LP 339-7 system.

Independent miners delivered large quantities of construction materials, which were used to complete construction of the new installation. The starport Miner Prospects has now opened for business in the planetary ring of LP 339-7 4.

Company CEO Dr Lewis Chapman held a press conference to thank those involved:

« The new base will offer much-needed resources to the system's outer reaches, and act as the headquarters for our SE Mining division. I never doubted the galactic community's response, and it is a humbling thing to see in action. »

Commanders who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Gell-Mann Ring in the LP 339-7 system.


* The Winking Cat's Return
The notorious art thief known as the Winking Cat has resurfaced in the Alioth system during the Alliance Festival of Culture.

For the festival's sixth week, Garden City Gallery on Turner's World hosts an exhibition of the visual arts. Advanced security measures have been employed to prevent a repetition of the high-profile incident that occurred in June 3304, where the unique work 'Youscape' was stolen from a gallery vault.

Local correspondent Daron Warmack reported for The Alliance Tribune:

« When gallery staff noticed a painting hanging in a previously empty room, they were shocked to recognise it as 'Penance Street', the long-lost masterpiece of famous artist Megan Madigan. »

« Experts have verified that this is the original artwork, which vanished in transit 60 years ago. A graphic of a winking cat was also discovered on the wall behind the picture. »

« The Winking Cat has returned one of the Alliance's greatest art treasures \u2013 a personal contribution to the festival, perhaps, or maybe an act of penance. »

The Alliance Festival of Culture will conclude next week in the Diso system.


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

An exhibition of the visual arts has been upstaged by notorious art thief the Winking Cat during the Alliance Festival of Culture's sixth week. The stolen artwork 'Penance Street' by Megan Madigan was discovered in an empty room of the Garden City Gallery in Alioth. Gallery staff soon found the infamous winking cat motif hidden behind the picture.

The Starship Enterprises faction has confirmed the success of its initiative to establish an asteroid base in the LP 339-7 system. The corporation has expressed hope that an increase in trade and industry will benefit the whole system.

Finally, the Sap Core Legion faction has called for independent pilots to deliver resources for the construction of a medical facility in the Heike system. The organisers hope that the new orbital facility will benefit the region.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Sap Core Legion Initiative Concludes
A commodity drive hosted by the Sap Core Legion faction has ended successfully, resulting in the construction of a medical facility in the Heike system.

With independent pilots having provided commodities in large numbers, Swords Rest Medical Facility has now entered operation around Heike 1.

Professor Macklin Fox offered these words of thanks to contributors:

« I am pleased by the response to this initiative and appreciate the efforts of all involved. Access to off-world medical facilities is not just an Allied issue - it is an issue for the galaxy. »

Commanders who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Braun Enterprise in the Heike system.


* Alliance Festival of Culture Celebrates Finale
The Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its final week with a celebration of food and drink on the planet Birmingham in the Diso system.

Corinne Macintyre, culture correspondent for the Alliance Tribune, reported:

« City streets are lined with stalls offering a wide range of food. Dishes range from humble, home-cooked recipes using local speciality Diso Ma Corn, to delicacies such as baked greebles. Drink connoisseurs have sampled everything from Ethgreze Tea Buds to Leestian Evil Juice, while a multi-storey cocktail bar sponsored by distillers of Lavian Brandy has attracted revellers. »

« Despite some companies experiencing difficulty sourcing ingredients, following lower than expected harvests in some systems, this event has been enjoyed by millions of hungry visitors. »

To mark the conclusion of the seven-week festival, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made this announcement:

« I'd like to offer my sincerest thanks to everyone who helped make the Alliance Festival of Culture a grand success. We've enjoyed amazing artwork, heard beautiful music and experienced great theatre in recent weeks, much to our delight. I have been reminded just how diverse and colourful the Alliance's shared cultures can be. Artists and creatives across the galaxy are invited to make the Alliance their home and further enrich this vibrant society. »


* Week in Review
Here are this week's main stories.

The Alliance Festival of Culture has drawn to a close with a celebration of food and drink in the Diso system. Attendees sampled dishes prepared by celebrated chefs, and enjoyed a wide variety of complementary beverages. Suppliers managed to overcome initial concerns that low harvests in nearby systems would impact the festival. Prime Minister Mahon hailed the event as a huge success.

The Sap Core Legion faction has announced the successful conclusion of its initiative to outfit a new orbital medical facility in the Heike system. The installation, Swords Rest Medical Facility, is now operational around Heike 1.

And those are the main stories this week.


* Agricultural Industry Predicts Low Harvest
The Interstellar Association for Agriculture has announced that below-average crop yields are expected in several key locations.

Dr Genevieve Kane, writing on behalf of the organisation, published this statement:

« Recent audits conducted on two primary agricultural worlds, located in Diso and Orerve, indicate that staple food harvests have been markedly lower in recent months. »

« Broader data analysis suggests that crop returns in several other systems may also fail to meet projected quotas. An investigation is underway to identify the reasons for this drop in produce. »

« To prevent a shortage of produce from impacting consumers, the IAA is reviewing options to enhance the fertility of cropland used for domestic consumption. These include newly proposed synthetic treatments that we hope will increase the sustainability of essential harvests. »

The situation was first highlighted during the Alliance Festival of Culture's culinary week, when events in the Diso system were impacted by difficulties in sourcing fresh ingredients. Subsequent reports have indicated that these shortages are not unique to Allied space.


* Rockforth Corporation Reveals New Fertiliser
A new agricultural fertiliser has been released by the Rockforth Corporation in response to growing concerns over low harvests in several systems.

Rex Whitlock, the company's marketing director, gave this statement to shareholders:

« We at Rockforth are deeply concerned by the recent reports of poor staple crop yields. We are determined to ensure that the food-supply chains are not impacted. »

« Our new EX7 fertiliser has been synthetically enhanced to enrich soil, increase macronutrients and promote growth across all types of cropland. We have prioritised its development and are confident that it will help minimise the risk of future food shortages. »

« Distribution of the fertiliser has started at Marshall Dock in the Riedquat system. We encourage traders to take advantage of our introductory prices. »

Many farmers have already begun putting the new fertiliser to use, but Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture commented:

« There are concerns that, in order to bring this new product to market quickly, Rockforth may not have satisfied all regulatory checks. The IAA has therefore requested tight regulation of the fertiliser's distribution until full compliance can be verified. »


* Rockforth Corporation Sales Spike
Share prices in the Rockforth Corporation have risen following the success of its latest fertiliser.

With key agricultural systems reporting crop failures over the past few weeks, the mega-corporation has capitalised on farmers' demands for new treatments. Sales of Rockforth's fertiliser have beaten expectations, with multiple systems importing large quantities of stock.

Rockforth marketing director Rex Whitlock provided this statement:

« I believe that our long-standing dedication to quality has played no small part in the success of this product. Since its inception, the Rockforth Corporation has represented the cutting edge of agricultural technology. »

« Hard-working farmers facing this challenge require our support, and we have pledged to meet their needs. I am confident that the EX7 fertiliser will help to mitigate any further losses. »

Meanwhile, Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture has repeated calls for distribution restrictions.

« Our compliance department has been in regular communication with Rockforth representatives, but we have yet to receive the requested documentation. »

« Sometimes these matters take longer than expected, of course. Until the request has been fulfilled, however, we again urge caution in the trade of Rockforth's latest commodity. »


* Poor Harvests Impact Core Systems
The impact of low crop yields in key agricultural systems has reached civilian populations, prompting public concerns over food availability.

Freelance journalist Adalyn Cross published this report on Vox Galactica:

« The scarcity of fresh fruit and vegetables has become a major concern. Despite the efforts of agricultural bodies and corporations to prevent shortages from affecting the general public, the availability of produce is believed to have fallen further in recent weeks. »

« With fear of a widespread food shortage rising, stockpiling of staple foods by markets and citizens has increased. Prices have fluctuated as opportunistic suppliers take advantage of the situation. »

« It's clear that the situation is more complicated than a mere bad harvest, but as yet there has been little effective response from local governments. »

In related news, the Rockforth Corporation has publically responded to the Interstellar Association for Agriculture, following requests for compliance documentation related to its new fertiliser. Rockforth marketing director Rex Whitlock made this statement:

« We see it as our duty to lead the recovery of affected farming communities, and our revolutionary fertiliser will play a big role. I have full confidence that our new product meets the IAA's standards, and we will fulfil their request at the earliest opportunity. »


* Common Symptoms Among Damaged Crops
The Interstellar Association for Agriculture has identified similarities in the crop failures reported in multiple systems over the past several weeks.

Dr Genevieve Kane, a spokesperson for the organisation, outlined a pattern of common biological markers contained in diseased harvests of staple food crops.

« We have collated multiple reports in which farmers recorded healthy crops withering in a matter of days. Agronomists have confirmed that the symptoms of decay are identical, and share genetic similarities to known pathogens, but have not yet identified the cause. »

« The IAA is coordinating with other agricultural and scientific bodies to investigate this situation further. »

The lack of staple foods has triggered a cascade effect across the core systems, leading to the panic buying and stockpiling of consumables. While non-perishable foodstuffs are keeping local populations fed, many authorities are struggling to address their citizens' concerns.

The following statement from Governor Nadeem Clayton of the Orerve system is typical of the announcements made by political leaders in affected systems:

« I can assure you that the current disruption is merely temporary. We guarantee that critical food supplies will remain available, and urge the public not to overreact. A committee has been established to explore the possibility of financial support for landowners affected by this unfortunate situation. »


* Initiative to Counter Poor Harvests
Two coordinated trade initiatives have been launched, spearheading efforts to mitigate the impact of low crop yields in key systems.

The initiatives have been organised by Crimson State Limited in the Diso system and Orerve Universal Limited in the Orerve system. The significant loss of crops in these agricultural centres is a primary cause for the low availability of staple foodstuffs.

The initiatives received praise from Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture:

« This campaign is a step in the right direction, and with the help of the galactic community should stop the situation from becoming a full-scale crisis. »

« The IAA is currently investigating the reasons for such poor harvests, and it seems that a new form of blight may be responsible for the rapid degeneration of crops. Scientific teams are analysing samples of diseased tissue, and we expect to know more soon. »

Traders are asked to deliver pesticides, synthetic reagents and grain to Shifnalport in the Diso system and Watson Station in the Orerve system.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 10th to the 16th of October 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Food Shortages Spark Civil Unrest
A recent commodity appeal has spurred civil unrest in several systems, with civilians fearing that their respective governments are unable to cope with the widespread crop failures.

Vox Galactica published a report on developments by journalist Adalyn Cross:

« Following crop failures on a massive scale, the projected availability of staple foodstuffs has drastically fallen in a number of systems. This, in turn, has triggered increased prices, panic buying and stockpiling - all of which have exacerbated the problem. »

« On the most severely impacted worlds, such as Birmingham and Simpson's Eden, citizens are taking to the streets and demanding answers from the authorities. But with food supplies being strangled at the source, it appears little can be done to appease their frustration. »

Nathaniel Lopez of the Galactic Welfare Trust, a charitable aid foundation, made this statement:

« Low-income families and those dependent on welfare have been hit hardest by these shortages. Our organisation is distributing food cartridges, but frankly the magnitude of this situation dwarfs our efforts. Billions of people are at risk of going hungry if a solution cannot be found. »

« We call upon food manufacturers to help alleviate the problem by reducing prices. To those companies aiming to make a short-term profit, be warned \u2013 you could be contributing to significant loss of life from starvation. »


* The Mystery of the Blight
The cause of mass crop spoilage on key agricultural worlds has been attributed to a new disease affecting plants.

Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture summarised the organisation's findings:

« The rapid decay of plant life on multiple planets was caused by the same strain of advanced blight. Its origin and vectors remain unknown, and it has so far resisted all established methods of treatment. »

« Our analysis has not determined if the blight is a natural mutation or an artificial pathogen. Until we confirm this and develop a method of preventing further spread, viable cropland will become scarcer and the production of staple foods will continue to drop. »

« The Vandermeer Corporation has offered to assist the IAA with its research. The company's experience of molecular diagnostics will hopefully contribute to a breakthrough. »

Journalist Adalyn Cross reported on this development for Vox Galactica:

« Speculation on the cause of the blight has spread like wildfire, with theories ranging from chronic mismanagement to industrial sabotage. Political enemies are also being blamed in every affected system, with competing factions quick to lay the blame at each other's doorstep. »

« As tensions rise and billions find themselves short on food, such accusations are likely to escalate to dangerous levels. Trade initiatives and charitable imports are all proving helpful, but will that be enough to stave off disaster? »


* Initiative to Eradicate Rockforth Fertiliser
The Rockforth Corporation's EX7 fertiliser has been linked to the blight affecting crops in a number of systems, prompting an initiative to remove the product from the market.

Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture delivered an urgent message:

« Comparative analysis has confirmed that the blight is caused by the EX7 fertiliser. The original poor harvests have been attributed to natural factors, and it is now thought that the situation could have been contained had the fertiliser not exacerbated the problem. »

« Initial food shortages were offset by a recent trade appeal in the Diso and Orerve systems, but the blight's symptoms have since been reported in hundreds of systems. While we investigate the reasons for this rapid spread, preventing further fertiliser distribution is vital. »

Rockforth fertiliser can now be collected at zero cost from the following markets:

Sharon Lee Free Market, Orrere

Lave Station, Lave

Warinus, Lave

Shifnalport, Diso

Davies High, Reorte

Watson Station, Orerve

Roentgen Hub, LFT 37

Macedo Station, Lei Zi

Phillips Gateway, Ensoreus

Baird Gateway, Arque

La Soeur du Dan Ham, Riedquat

The Teveri Progressive Party has arranged for the safe disposal of the fertiliser and has offered to compensate pilots for their efforts. The fertiliser should be delivered to Wiley Port in the Teveri system.

To expedite this initiative, Lakon Spaceways has agreed to lower the cost of the Type-6 Transporter, Type-7 Transporter and Type-9 Heavy. Cargo rack prices have also been reduced in all starports.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 16th to the 22nd of October 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Superpowers Collaborate to Investigate Blight
A collaborative body has been formed by the three superpowers to trace the source of the blight that is laying waste to crops on key agricultural worlds.

The development was covered by journalist Adalyn Cross for Vox Galactica:

« We know that the Rockforth fertiliser caused the advanced decay that has affected so many crops, but the specifics remain unclear. Was the corrupted fertiliser the result of an industrial manufacturing error, or perhaps sabotage by a rival company? Is there evidence of a deliberate effort to harm the people of the core systems? »

« With billions of citizens facing food shortages, departments from all three superpowers are collaborating to identify the origin of the blight and halt its progress. The speed with which the blight has spread is frankly stunning. »

Rex Whitlock, marketing director at Rockforth Corporation, released this statement:

« This development has come as a shock to everyone at Rockforth. Our EX7 fertiliser passed many rigorous tests and successfully increased crop productivity in controlled experiments, so we have no explanation for its calamitous effects. »

« We would like to reassure customers and shareholders alike that we are cooperating fully with the investigation. »


* Blight Traced to Synthetic Contaminant
A tri-superpower group has identified the cause of the blight that has ruined crops on multiple worlds.

Gino Borstein of the Federal Intelligence Agency delivered a report on behalf of the cross-superpower taskforce:

« Working with the Rockforth Corporation, we have confirmed that the EX7 fertiliser was deliberately contaminated with a chemical compound shortly after mass production began. »

« The contaminant has a unique synthetic composition specifically designed to introduce a highly aggressive pathogen that quickly destroys plant matter. Our investigations have uncovered several potential leads, and we expect to identify the contaminant's point of origin soon. »

Vox Galactica journalist Adalyn Cross commented:

« Taken at face value, this seems to absolve Rockforth of causing the blight. But there may yet be culpability issues, considering the company's cavalier attitude towards regulatory checks. Commentators have pointed to the requests made by the Interstellar Association for Agriculture as evidence that the company placed profit above safety. »

« The question is: who is behind this attempt to eradicate the food supplies of billions of people? Are we dealing with a terrorist attack on an interstellar scale? Or was this an attempt to ruin Rockforth, perhaps committed by a dangerous corporate rival? »

In related news, additional cargo checks have been implemented at starports following the blight's rapid spread. Researchers have theorised that contaminated goods ferried by unsuspecting traders are to blame for introducing the blight to non-agricultural systems.


* Militant Group Responsible for Blight
An extremist group from the Kappa Fornacis system is responsible for the contaminated fertiliser that has caused widespread crop failures.

Gino Borstein made this statement on behalf of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the blight's origin:

« Our investigation has confirmed that an activist group known as Scythe of Panem managed to infiltrate Rockforth Corporation manufacturing plants in the Riedquat system. Members of the group contaminated the EX7 fertiliser with a synthetic agent designed to putrefy plant matter. »

Recent efforts by the galactic community have almost eradicated the EX7 fertiliser. But Borstein warned that the activists have turned hostile upon discovery.

« The group's manifesto discusses revenge for the Federation's 3301 campaign to wipe out the recreational drug known as Onion Head. This involved an orbital bombardment of Onion Head crops on Panem using biocides with a similar genomic structure to the blight. It's likely that the activists used these biocides as the foundation of their synthetic agent. »

« Shortly after we located Scythe of Panem cells in the Quator system, their more militant members responded with unprovoked violence. Local citizens are now at risk of being caught in the crossfire. »

An effort to neutralise the activists is being led by the Bruthanvan Co faction, which has requested tactical support from the galactic community.

Independent pilots who destroy Scythe of Panem ships in the Quator system will be generously rewarded by Bruthanvan Co. This campaign will run from the 22nd to the 28th of October 3305.


* Blight Mutates into New Pathogen
The pathogen introduced to crops by the contaminated EX7 fertiliser has displayed signs of self-sufficiency, potentially threatening crops in thousands of systems.

Lead Researcher Mason Chu of the Vandermeer Corporation stated:

« A successful initiative to destroy contaminated Rockforth fertiliser means it no longer poses a threat to cropland. But our research suggests that the blight can survive independently of the fertiliser. »

« This new pathogen is aggressive, highly resilient to market pesticides and hard to quarantine. If not adequately contained, the blight could become a full-blown scourge that cripples food supplies wherever it spreads. »

« We are testing a number of potential treatments, including some radical methods suggested by teams from Neomedical Industries. If fortune smiles on us we may be able to combat the pathogen directly. »

In related news, there has been much speculation about the Scythe of Panem, the extremist group that engineered the blight. Some insight was offered by Zander Lachance, a representative of the Coalition for Onion Head Legalisation:

« Actually, we've known about the Scythe of Panem for several years. They were always obsessed with getting payback for the mass destruction of Onion Head crops in 3301. But over the past year they attracted some aggressive anti-capitalists, who started pushing to inflict serious economic damage as vengeance for Kappa Fornacis. Seems the new crowd were more persuasive than we realised. »

« It's a shame that these actions will reinforce the negative stereotypes around Onion Head. We only hope that those of us who advocate its therapeutic many beneficial uses won't be tarnished with the same brush. »


* Anti-Blight Treatment Discovered
The galactic community has been asked to support an initiative that could counteract the blight that is devastating crops in hundreds of systems.

With the blight pathogen present across inhabited space, the Interstellar Association for Agriculture has decided to press ahead with controlled distribution of a promising new agronomic treatment.

The IAA's Dr Genevieve Kane provided further information:

« Ever since the blight was identified, our scientists have been working alongside Rockforth Corporation research teams to develop an effective counteragent. We appreciate the full cooperation granted by Rockforth Corporation representatives in this endeavour. »

« Following essential contributions by both the Vandermeer Corporation and Neomedical Industries, we have developed an agronomic treatment that should reverse the disease's effects. »

« The priority is to transport the treatment to the Diso and Orerve systems, which were among the first to be ravaged by the blight. If these primary agricultural centres can be made viable again, we can then proceed to revitalise crop production elsewhere. »

Agronomic Treatment can now be collected from the following markets:

Conway City, Ltt 4961

George Lucas, Leesti

Thomson Orbital, Lansbury

Cousin Ring, Tjindjin

Margulis Station, CD-44 10336

Nourse City, Esumindii

Independent traders have been asked to deliver the agronomic treatment to Shifnalport in the Diso system and Watson Station in the Orerve system.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 24th to the 30th of October 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* In the Shadow of the Blight
People across the core systems are adapting to food shortages caused by the blight, as the threat of widespread starvation increases.

Vox Galactica journalist Adalyn Cross has been following the situation:

« With staple foodstuffs scarce in many systems, long-forgotten brands have been resurrected, as freeze-dried and preserved goods return to favour. Restaurant menus are being reduced, and new recipes have been devised by innovative chefs \u2013 many of whom refuse to reveal their ingredients. »

« On certain worlds, alternative crops are being imported, with the extra costs offset by increased taxes. Private companies such as Rackham Capital Investments and Silva Holdings Inc have also donated enormous sums to foodstuff shipments, which has been hugely appreciated by the general public.

« In a curious development, one direct beneficiary of the blight has been the fishing industry. Pescatarian diets are on the rise, with many celebrities declaring a newfound passion for seafood dishes in the absence of fresh fruit and vegetables. »

Despite this, billions now rely on food cartridges and ration packs that offer only basic nutrition. Welfare charities are shipping aid to wherever it is most needed, but admit that their resources have been stretched to breaking point.

« With the mutated blight proving so effective at destroying cropland, » said Cross, « Mason Chu's warning that we may be facing a galaxy-wide scourge looks more likely to become a bitter reality. »


* Scythe of Panem Militants Defeated
Scythe of Panem, the activist group responsible for the crop-destroying blight, has been defeated in the Quator system.

Supported by Bruthanvan Co security teams, independent pilots were able to neutralise the group's militant ringleaders. Scythe of Panem members have also been arrested following the raid of an unregistered facility discovered beneath the planetary port Weber Settlement.

FIA Agent Gino Borstein spoke on behalf of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the blight:

« Initial questioning has confirmed that Scythe of Panem originally sought revenge for the Federation's orbital bombing of Onion Head crops on Panem nearly five years ago. But a recent change in leadership led them towards more extreme methods, fuelled by anti-capitalist sentiment, with the objective of disrupting the galactic economy. »

« The term 'Crops for Crops' recurs in many of the data entries and communications recovered from the underground facility. We believe this phrase was used as a rallying cry by members. »

Traders are currently transporting the agronomic treatment for the blight pathogen, with a focus on the Diso and Orerve systems. As yet there is no official word regarding its effectiveness, but the Interstellar Association for Agriculture remains optimistic.

Vox Galactica published an opinion piece from journalist Adalyn Cross:

« A vital question remains: has the damage already been done? While the originators of the blight have been brought to justice, can a galaxy-wide eradication of food supplies be prevented? »

Pilots who assisted with the campaign in the Quator system can now pick up their rewards from the Bruthanvan Co at Quator Station.


* Blight Pathogen Cured
The agronomic treatment recently developed by the Interstellar Association for Agriculture has proven effective against the devastating crop blight.

The treatment was distributed as part of an initiative focusing on the Diso and Orerve systems. Planetside farming communities in both systems are beginning to recover from severe crop damage.

Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture gave this statement to the media:

« Thanks to the heroic efforts of the galactic community, we can confirm that the agronomic treatment performs superbly on infected farmland. The counteragent eliminated the mutated blight pathogen within hours, facilitating the recovery of living crops. »

« Therefore, the IAA can confidently state that the immediate threat of food shortages has been alleviated, with food deliveries replenishing lost stocks. Mass production of the agronomic treatment has already begun, and it will soon be available across the galaxy to counteract the blight wherever it is found. »

Pilots who contributed to either of the initiatives can now collect their rewards from Shifnalport in the Diso system and Watson Station in the Orerve system, respectively.


* The Lessons of the Blight
The blight that laid waste to vast areas of cropland over the past month has now officially been contained.

Reports from the Interstellar Association for Agriculture confirm that the blight has been eliminated from all affected systems. The new agronomic treatment has rejuvenated emaciated fields, with the remaining harvests once again viable.

Journalist Adalyn Cross published a review of recent events on Vox Galactica:

« As the availability of staple foodstuffs begins to return to something like a normal level, many pundits are asking what lessons can be learned from this catastrophe. The IAA has pledged to intensify screening regulations for agricultural commodities. The speed with which the blight spread caught many by surprise, and it is vital that this does not happen again. »

« Intelligence agencies have pledged to review their strategies for tackling interstellar terrorism. The Scythe of Panem extremists who engineered the blight have been dealt with, but who else might be planning a biochemical attack? »

Meanwhile, the Rockforth Corporation's PR department is working hard to reassure customers and shareholders. Critics have underscored the role of the EX7 fertiliser as a primary delivery system for the pathogen, but a Rockforth source argued that the product's sabotage by Scythe of Panem agents could not have been anticipated.

Nevertheless, the company's haste to increase profits has been highlighted as a contributing factor in the blight's impact. Rockforth is expected to release a statement in the next few days, pending an internal review.


* Rockforth Corporation Releases Apology
The CEO of Rockforth Corporation has expressed regret at her company's role in the distribution of blight pathogen, which ravaged crops in hundreds of systems.

In a statement to the media, Sylvia Rockforth insisted that the lack of proper oversight in the manufacture of EX7 fertiliser was an 'anomaly', inconsistent with the company's 'traditional commitment to quality'.

« I offer my sincere apologies to everyone affected by the blight, » said Rockforth. « The premature release of an ultimately damaging product is unacceptable. My company now has a great deal of work ahead to regain the trust of our customers and partners. The foundation of a restitution fund, using profits made from EX7, is the first step towards doing so. »

« A review of decisions preceding the release of EX7 has resulted in the termination of several Rockforth employee contracts. This includes former marketing director Rex Whitlock. Rex's desire for career progression overcame his common sense, and his dismissal of regulatory practices placed billions of good people in danger. »

In other news, Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture has confirmed that thousands of markets across the galaxy will now stock its specialised agronomic treatment.

« We have established the widespread manufacture and distribution of the treatment, ensuring availability in the event of a blight outbreak, » said Dr Kane.

« Additionally, data provided by IAA vessels indicates that we can accurately determine which areas of the galaxy are in need of agronomic treatment. One anomaly involved an unexpected call for supplies from the Upaniklis system, which will need to be investigated. But otherwise we are satisfied with our detection methods. »


* Inhabited Generation Ship Discovered
A generation ship with a living population has been discovered in the Upaniklis system.

The ship's distress signal was initially picked up by a listening post. Investigating pilots were surprised to find that the ancient vessel - identified as the Golconda - had drifted into the uninhabited region around Upaniklis B.

Generation ships are huge, self-sufficient craft from the pre-hyperdrive era, designed to deliver their original crews' descendants to uninhabited systems. Launched in the 22nd century, the Golconda has survived for more than a millennium as the home of a self-reliant society.

But it is believed the vessel's outdated facilities are struggling to meet the needs of its crew. The inhabitants have reported a lack of maintenance materials and medical supplies, the latter made more pertinent by a virus sweeping through the ship.

Itsuko Harada of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated gave the following statement:

« These visitors have crossed incredible distances, entirely disconnected from the rest of humanity until now. Sheer desperation has forced these proud people to call for help \u2013 a disease referred to as 'the wasting kiss' is running rampant, and in a closed environment its effects may prove catastrophic. »

« Understandably, the Golconda's people are reluctant to leave their home or interact with the rest of the galaxy, at least at present. They have gratefully accepted our offer of medical supplies and other materials, however. »

Traders are asked to deliver basic medicines, advanced medicines, aluminium, ceramic composites and semiconductors to Fozard Port in the Upaniklis system. Upaniklis Vision Incorporated is also offering bounty vouchers on wanted ships to deter pirate activity in the area.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 8th to the 14th of November 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* The Golconda Generation
The culture of the generation ship Golconda has been examined by Professor Elizabeth Perez, head of anthropology at Orion Independent University.

« Little is known about the Golconda's origins. There are no intact records of its launch, and the lack of archived blueprints suggests a privately funded colonisation attempt. But there's no doubt this microcosm of 22nd Century society will have diverged over the past thousand years. »

« The inhabitants' language is entirely comprehensible, however, and their social structure is recognisable. Rigid security measures are in evidence, as one would expect from an isolationist culture. »

« We also know there is a custodian tasked with ensuring the community's wellbeing, and a chaplain who provides spiritual guidance. All signs point to contentment with \u2013 maybe even an addiction to \u2013 their spacefaring existence. »

While audio messages recorded by the Golconda crew are available to the galactic community, only a select handful of individuals representing Upaniklis Vision Incorporated have been permitted to dock with the Golconda. Professor Perez travelled to Upaniklis to speak with them as part of her study.

« Interviews with those who delivered supplies were fascinating. As one pilot put it: 'The loading procedures were done at top speed, hardly any comms chatter at all. Nobody on the Golconda entered the cargo bays before we left. I got the impression they were scared stiff of us.' »

« History shows that isolated cultures can be irrevocably damaged by contact with outsiders. We must ensure that efforts to support the Golconda community do not destroy this unique bubble-colony. »


* Golconda Receives Vital Aid
The initiative in the Upaniklis system to provide the generation ship Golconda with essential supplies has concluded successfully.

A statement was provided by Itsuko Harada of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated:

« Sincere thanks to all traders who delivered medicines and emergency supplies, and also to the brave pilots who protected these shipments against pirate raids. Transfer of the goods to the Golconda has concluded, and I understand they were accepted gratefully. »

The medical supplies were accompanied by representatives of the Interstellar Health Organisation, who advised the colonists on their use. Team leader Dr Ivan Johansen commented:

« Our antiviral agents are far more advanced than those on the Golconda, and early indications suggest patients are responding well to treatment. Hopefully we have halted the outbreak of what the colony calls 'the wasting kiss'. »

Reports from Upaniklis government insiders indicate that communication with the Golconda has become more frequent, particularly in regards to technological advancements. Local media coverage has fuelled public speculation that the colonists should abandon their ancient vessel and establish a new home in the system.

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now obtain their rewards from Fozard Port in the Upaniklis system.


* Golconda Attracts Superpower Interest
The discovery of an inhabited generation ship has attracted attention from both the Empire and the Federation.

A recent trade appeal in the Upaniklis system provided the Golconda with emergency aid. Each of the superpowers has since deployed a megaship to the area, along with proposals for integrating the Golconda's crew into the galactic community.

Imperial senator Ava Cornelius released this statement:

« This remarkable thousand-year mission exemplifies humanity's indomitable spirit. We stand ready to help these colonists complete that mission by constructing a new planetary settlement exclusively for their use. There, they will finally be able to enjoy solid ground and open skies, in a colony that thrives under Imperial protection. »

Federal Congressman Harlan Turk outlined an alternative approach:

« As the descendants of a generation ship launched from Sol, we view these courageous travellers as honorary Federal citizens. We therefore hold that they are entitled to remain a spacefaring commune as their ancestors wished, and intend to honour their traditional way of life with an orbital outpost to call their own. »

There has been minimal communication with the Golconda, and only a select few representatives of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated have interacted with the colonists. Assuming that the freshly donated supplies can fortify this micro-civilisation, vital decisions will need to be made regarding the Golconda's future.


* Superpowers Compete over Golconda's Future
The Empire and the Federation have announced rival initiatives to provide a new home for the crew of the generation ship Golconda.

During the aid appeal by Upaniklis Vision Incorporated, engineering experts confirmed that the ancient vessel can no longer meet the colony's needs. While the Golconda was designed for long-term habitation, it lacks adequate facilities for the current population levels.

After lengthy discussion, the Golconda's leaders have reluctantly decided to abandon the vessel. But the ship's captain, Jonathon Forester, has insisted that its population remain together in one location.

The Empire has vowed to help the colonists complete the ship's original mission by establishing a planetside home. Senator Ava Cornelius summarised the campaign:

« After generations in an artificial environment, we want to reward these travellers with a world to call their own, fulfilling their destiny after a millennium of adventure. Contemporary agricultural techniques will enable them to become a self-sustaining colony with full Imperial support. »

The Federation has taken a different approach, offering to create an outpost where the Golconda's spacefaring traditions can continue. This was outlined by Congressman Harlan Turk:

« These people have the inalienable right to continue their current way of life. A modern outpost will offer vastly superior amenities while allowing their culture to remain intact, with facilities for new trade relationships within Federal market guidelines. »

Both superpowers have asked the galactic community to support their campaigns. Pilots can deliver polymers, CMM composites, titanium, beryllium and thallium to either of the megaships in the Upaniklis system: The Lucent Embrace for the Empire or Keller's Resolve for the Federation.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 18th to the 26th of November 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* A Gift from the Golconda
The inhabitants of the generation ship Golconda have offered a token of gratitude to authorities in the Upaniklis system for their recent help.

The gift was a case of an alcoholic spirit labelled Apa Vietii, distilled only aboard the Golconda for many centuries. An accompanying note explained that the production technique has remained largely unchanged since the 22nd century.

Analysis of the beverage confirmed it was safe for consumption, although nothing is known of the raw ingredients or distillation process.

As yet very few people have sampled Apa Vietii, but the celebrated gourmet and critic Giles Cappelleo was invited to appraise the spirit:

« Well, what a delight this is \u2013 to experience a previously unheard-of libation! Apa Vietii is refreshing on the palate with a smooth, crisp flavour, but delivers a vigorous thump to the senses once swallowed. If it ever becomes widely available, connoisseurs everywhere would surely adore it. The Golconda crew is sitting atop a potential goldmine! »

Professor Elizabeth Perez of the Orion Independent University provided an anthropologist's take:

« This is a significant gesture from a society that has been highly reluctant to interact with outsiders. Although their isolationist stance remains prevalent, offering Apa Vietii could be interpreted as the start of a cultural exchange programme prior to rejoining civilisation. »


* Federation Delivers Golconda's New Home
The Federation has won the bid to provide the Golconda's population with a permanent home, beating a rival effort by the Empire.

Both campaigns received support from the galactic community, but the initiative to create a new orbital outpost for the generation ship's inhabitants ultimately proved more popular than the construction of a planetary port.

An official message from the Golconda confirmed that the colonists were impressed by the superpower's success, and have agreed to migrate to the outpost once it has been completed. The outpost will be named Forester's Choice to honour the captain of the Golconda, Jonathon Forester.

The Golconda crew have also accepted the status of a Federal partner while retaining their autonomy.

Congressman Harlan Turk made this statement:

« We are proud to offer a fresh start to a society descended from the Federation's forebears. Their unique culture will continue to thrive among the stars at an outpost that enjoys Federal protection. »

Imperial Senator Ava Cornelius sent a message of goodwill to Captain Forester and his crew. She admitted disappointment at the Golconda's decision but wished the colonists peace and prosperity for the future.

Supporters of the Imperial and Federal campaigns can now collect outstanding rewards from their respective megaships in the Upaniklis system.


* Golconda's Inhabitants Migrate to Forester's Choice
The crew of the generation ship Golconda have migrated to their new home - the outpost Forester's Choice in the Upaniklis system.

Following a successful bid to assist the Golconda crew with their relocation, the Federation arranged for transportation from the ancient vessel to the outpost now in orbit around Upaniklis B 3.

Communication with the generation ship in the days prior to departure revealed a certain amount of trepidation among their people. But with centuries of space travel having exhausted the Golconda's ability to adequately sustain the colonists, the majority supported the decision to relocate.

The Golconda's command staff also confirmed that they would continue distillation of the beverage Apa Vietii. This unique spirit will be on sale to traders from Forester's Choice.

Professor Elizabeth Perez, head of anthropology at Orion Independent University, was on hand to observe the mass resettlement:

« Many of the colonists openly wept as they stepped aboard the transport vessels, speaking words of thanks and sorrow to the Golconda itself. On several occasions, the emigrants broke spontaneously into song, with hundreds locked arm-in-arm. »

« During the flight I overheard a group of youths chatting excitedly about the technology that would be available to them, perhaps ignorant of the significance of their journey. But most striking was the people's collective determination to maintain their unique culture, and to remain together as they enter this new chapter. »

« It remains to be seen whether this society will retain its isolationist outlook or willingly integrate with the galaxy. We can only hope that these remarkable travellers from the past will be left alone long enough to explore 34th-century humanity at their own pace. »

To celebrate this historic event, the Federation has announced that a purchase discount will be applied to Federal ships between the 5th and 16th of December 3305.


* Holloway Biology Centre Opens
Following months of setbacks, the Holloway Biology Centre has finally opened in the Colonia system. The research centre will focus on the study of newly catalogued lifeforms.

Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the Holloway Bioscience Institute, held a press conference at the opening ceremony, and discussed the delays that followed a successful campaign to found the centre in February this year:

« Our study of the lifeforms discovered over the past year formed the basis of the research centre's designs. As the volume of scans provided by the galactic community continued to grow, it became apparent that we lacked the laboratory space required to study it all. »

« As a result, the Holloway Bioscience Institute committed to several months of investment and redesign, to ensure that a wide variety of material could be analysed. We are confident that this decision will prove more than worthwhile, and our scientists are excited to work in this state-of-the-art facility. »

The Holloway Biology Centre is located in the Colonia system on Colonia 7 G.


* Year's End Festivities in Reorte
The Reorte system has been selected for the Alliance's end-of-year festivities, prompting huge demand for commodities.

Traders, performance artists and chefs throughout Allied space have already flocked to the system, where billions of attendees are expected. The planet Home is planning a synchronous firework display spanning every continent, while the habitation decks of Davies High will offer a culinary celebration featuring dishes from across the galaxy.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was the guest of honour at the commencement ceremony, and he offered these words to the gathered press:

« As the year draws to a close we have a lot to be thankful for. There is peace between the superpowers. Thargoid encroachments on human space have ceased. Through hard work and cooperation, we have proven ourselves capable of rising together in response to significant challenges. This is something each and every one of us can be proud of. »

« And so, the Reorte system will host a celebration to tell future generations about. We call upon the galactic community to ensure the system is well supplied, and look forward to rewarding these ever-reliable pilots for their continued service. »

The Reorte Mining Coalition has elected to oversee the initiative. Units of fish, fruit and vegetables, animal meat and beer have been requested at Davies High in the Reorte system. More exotic traders are also encouraged to bring units of Lavian Brandy, Anduliga Fire Works and Eranin Pearl Whiskey.

To ensure the celebration goes without a hitch, the Reorte Mining Coalition has also offered to pay handsomely for all bounties collected on wanted ships in the system.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 12th to the 18th of December 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Reorte Year's End Festivities Conclude
End-of-year celebrations have concluded in the Reorte system, with organisers declaring the week a grand success.

Deliveries by independent pilots ensured that the needs of the billion-plus attendees were met. Meanwhile, agitators in the system were prevented from intercepting convoys or causing trouble.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon offered this statement:

« I'd like to express my gratitude and appreciation to everybody involved in the festivities, from interstellar traders to revellers on the streets. Now, as goods are packed away and sensory experience hubs are dismantled all across Home, the clean-up efforts begin. It has been a real honour to witness so many come together in Reorte. »

« On behalf of the Alliance Assembly, I wish everybody a most prosperous New Year. »

Pilots who took part in either campaign can now obtain their rewards from Davies High in the Reorte system.


* Thargoid Incursions in Witch Head Enclave
A series of Thargoid incursions into human-occupied Witch Head systems has alarmed the region's colonists. Multiple casualties have been reported, with pilots caught off-guard by the sudden increase in Thargoid ships.

The Thargoids had largely withdrawn from the Witch Head enclave following a heavy defeat in July 3305. Following a significant increase in Thargoid activity, Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research offered the following comments to Vox Galactica:

« Regrettably, the Thargoids were unlikely to surrender this area of space after a single defeat. Humanity may have established the Witch Head enclave, but the Thargoids are clearly still intent on driving us out \u2013 particularly with so many barnacle sites in the region. »

With starports at considerable risk of assault, local authorities are hopeful that a defence force can be organised soon. A number of independent pilots have already travelled great distances to engage the Thargoid forces.

Kelvin Masters, a regular pundit for the Rewired network, provided this take:

« Those people in the Witch Head are crazy if they thought the Thargoids were just going to roll over like good pups. We're six months down the road from our initial expansion into the sector, and the local factions seem to have forgotten they're living in Thargoid space. There's a little push-and-shove for influence going on, corporations vying for control. What's going to happen in the Witch Head enclave now the Thargoids are back in force? »


* Witch Head System Designations Updated
Universal Cartographics has updated the names of fifteen systems in the Witch Head enclave.

Cynthia Sideris, chair of Universal Cartographics, elaborated on the development:

« Last year's colonisation efforts resulted in a number of new settlements in the region, and providing systems with less unwieldy appellations is of great benefit to explorers. For example, 'the Wisanye system' rolls off the tongue much more agreeably than 'the Witch Head Sector FB-X c1-7 system'. »

« We are confident that these more personable memorable terms will be welcomed by the Witch Head community. »

The Witch Head enclave is currently experiencing a number of Thargoid incursions, prompting local factions to call for assistance.


* Vitadyne Nanomedicines Reach Galactic Market
The nanomedicines developed in December 3304 by Vitadyne Labs have been approved for distribution to medical facilities across the galaxy.

At the time of Vitadyne's original announcement, the nanomedicines were believed to be mere weeks away from widespread availability. The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) had verified the medicine's healing properties, and Vitadyne Labs owner Professor Katrien Rook had been hailed as a genius for spearheading the research and development project.

But some questioned how a relatively small company could produce such advanced drugs \u2013 questions that were answered when Pranav Antal announced that the nanomeds were derived from pharmaceuticals developed by the Utopia commune. Responding to accusations of theft, Professor Rook clarified that the original nanomeds had been legally salvaged from the wreckage of a Utopian transport ship.

A lengthy legal battle followed, with Pranav Antal demanding the return of both the original nanomedicines and the Vitadyne derivatives. Vitadyne argued that the derivatives were of great potential benefit to humanity, and should be made available for sale. The IHO eventually ruled in favour of Vitadyne Labs, with the caveat that all distribution be maintained by an established pharmaceutical corporation.

That honour went to the Vandermeer Corporation, which has now established the necessary manufacturing facilities. It has taken a year for all parties to agree on the rigid quality control measures and personnel qualifications required for the production of the nanomedicines.

« I am proud to announce that Vitadyne nanomedicines are now available for distribution from the Kuma system, » said Professor Rook at a press conference at Elion Dock. « We have established a fantastic relationship with the Vandermeer team, and we look forward to sharing the fruits of our labour with humanity. »


* Terrorist Attacks on Imperial Starports
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

The Empire has broadcast this message across its emergency channels:

« There have been multiple explosions within Mackenzie Relay station, in Princess Aisling Duval's home system of Cemiess. NMLA terrorists have claimed responsibility. »

« In coordinated attacks they have also struck at Tsiolkovsky Terminal in the Gabjaujis system, Garrido Market in the LHS 4031 system, and Muller Terminal in the Rabh system. »

« We urgently request assistance from the galactic community with repairing these starports and rescuing their populations. »

The Imperial Internal Security Service issued a bulletin regarding this current threat:

« The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA) is a paramilitary force of political extremists, whose activities have been small-scale until now. »

« Marlinism is a well-known ideology inspired by Marlin Duval, who established the Republic of Achenar in the 23rd century prior to it becoming the Empire. Many people in the fringe systems are Marlinists, who want to replace hereditary Emperors with representation by elected senators. Neo-Marlinism is a more radical conviction that only terror tactics will force such change. »

« The NMLA's hatred of the Imperial Family explains why it has targeted starports under the Duval banner. But its use of portable military-grade explosives is unprecedented, suggesting an increase in resources. »


* Starport Upgrade Initiative to Support Fleet Carriers
A press release from Brewer Corporation discusses plans to improve access to refuelling for owners of fleet carriers.

« We have been surprised and gratified by the popularity of our latest product. The options for independent pilots and crews have been considerably expanded by the versatility and capability of our Drake-Class Carriers. »

« But we have also listened to customers' concerns, in particular that large ships such as Anacondas, Corvettes and Clippers cannot dock with refinery outposts to take on Tritium fuel. »

« To help alleviate this issue, Brewer Corporation has partnered with two independent construction firms: Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc. They are tasked with upgrading a number of outposts into fully functioning starports, in order to make refuelling runs more efficient. »

The two construction companies that won this contract both have impressive track records in modifying orbital habitats. Kavanagh Spaceframes specialises in Orbis starports, while Steel Castle exclusively works with Coriolis designs. The projects are expected to begin next week.


* Inquiry into Starship One's Destruction Concludes
An independent inquiry by the Federal Attorney's Office into the destruction of presidential vessel Starship One has produced a final report.

Senior Attorney Milandu Okoro made this statement:

« The loss of presidential vessel Starship One in May 3301, along with hundreds of lives, was a great tragedy. Despite suspicion that this was an attempt to eliminate then-President Jasmina Halsey, initial investigations concluded that a catastrophic malfunction of its drive systems was the likely cause. »

« A new inquiry was opened when fresh evidence came to light, including testimonies from several members of the Federal Navy. Our final report states that there is sufficient reason to believe Starship One was destroyed by deliberate sabotage. »

« A grand jury has determined that criminal charges should be made. We have shared our findings with the Federal Intelligence Agency, and understand that an arrest will take place shortly. »

The inquiry report is not yet in the public domain, but is thought to allege that illegal modifications were made to the Frame Shift Drive system of Starship One in advance of its destruction during flight through hyperspace.


* Terror Attacks Used Thargoid-Derived Explosives
The Imperial Internal Security Service has transmitted another urgent bulletin regarding terrorist attacks on starports in the Empire.

« There have been indications that the four starports came under attack by Thargoids. We can confirm that this is not the case, and there is no evidence of Thargoid vessels in the vicinity. »

« Observers reported that some of the damage inflicted on the stations' infrastructure closely resembled the effect of Thargoid weaponry. This was registered by internal sensor systems, resulting in automatic emergency broadcasts designed to summon aid during a Thargoid incursion. »

« Preliminary investigations suggest the use of customised explosive devices that incorporated elements of Thargoid technology. This suggests that the perpetrators have access to unusually sophisticated resources as well as xenological materials. »

« As yet there is no reason to doubt that the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA) is responsible for these attacks. We have received reports of jubilant scenes from some Imperial fringe systems, in territories where Marlinism remains popular. »

Help with rescue operations is still being requested from the four Imperial starports: Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system, Tsiolkovsky Terminal in the Gabjaujis system, Garrido Market in the LHS 4031 system, and Muller Terminal in the Rabh system.


* Prince Harold Duval Assassinated
Prince Harold Duval is dead after a targeted assassination attempt by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.

The Empire has imposed a media blackout on these events, and no official statement has been made. However, independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash published this on-the-scene report for Vox Galactica:

« From interviewing multiple sources, we gather that a single assassin managed to infiltrate Harold Duval's personal transport. He was killed by shipboard guards but not before shooting the Prince at close range. »

« The NMLA claimed responsibility for this attack in its latest propaganda broadcast, which referred to the Duval family as 'imperialist parasites'. The extremist group also demanded that 'Marlinists everywhere must rise up and demand a democratic Republic'. »

« Harold Duval was famously declared unfit for the throne by Emperor Hengist, and has been out of the public eye ever since. He rarely left Capitol but was making an unpublicised journey to visit his daughter Aisling Duval, presumably in response to the recent terrorist attack in the Cemiess system. »

« It remains unknown how the NMLA knew of the Prince's itinerary, or managed to breach security on his ship. »


* Community Support Required for Starport Conversions
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

Trading commodities required in Nagasairu and Tenche systems.

Two construction companies have requested materials to convert refinery outposts into starports, to assist owners of fleet carriers who use large vessels for tritium refuelling.

Susannah Haynes, CEO of Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, stated:

« With the galactic community's help, we can upgrade a maximum of five outposts into Orbis starports. Our intermediaries, Tenche Universal Holdings, will accept deliveries of building fabricators, power generators and thermal cooling units at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system. »

There were similar requests from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc:

« For travellers who find the familiar sight of Coriolis stations welcoming, here's a chance to build up to five more. We ask for shipments of bauxite, gallite and rutile to be delivered to CQC Holdings at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system. »

The number of starports will depend on the amount of materials delivered. The target systems in order of priority are Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin. If successful, upgrading will be done for the start of October.

Both initiatives begin on 17th September 3306 and will run for one week. If the final targets for a campaign are met earlier than planned, it will end immediately.


* Death of a Duval
Imperial news sources have confirmed that Prince Harold Duval was assassinated by NMLA terrorists while travelling incognito to the Cemiess system.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval broadcast this address:

« It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Prince Harold. A state funeral at the Hall of Martyrs is being arranged and there will be a period of mourning, as is customary for esteemed members of the Imperial Family. There will be opportunities for all citizens to honour Harold's memory in an appropriate manner. »

Princess Aisling Duval, Harold's daughter, appeared uncharacteristically distressed when she gave a brief statement to the media:

« It's a huge loss to us all that\u2026 I'm sorry\u2026 I can't believe this has happened. He can't be gone! I used to have some sympathy for the Marlinists, but now they\u2026 they took him from us. They took my daddy. »

The NMLA also attacked starports in the Cemiess, Gabjaujis, LHS 4031 and Rabh systems.

The Empire is now on heightened alert, and the Senate has approved new counter-terrorism initiatives proposed by Senator Denton Patreus.


* Arrest Made in Starship One Criminal Case
An officer in the Federal Navy Engineering Corps has been arrested for sabotaging the presidential vessel Starship One.

A statement was made by Milandu Okoro of the Federal Attorney's Office:

« Chief Technician Rory Webster was a department head of engineering for Starship One. Testimonies from members of Mr Webster's team claim that he ordered unauthorised adjustments to the ship's hyperdrive systems while in drydock, shortly before its launch in May 3301 and subsequent destruction. »

« This case is now being brought before the Federal High Court, where Mr Webster will stand trial for mass murder and attempted treason. »

There has been no comment from President Zachary Hudson, but Shadow President Felicia Winters told the press:

« This was a truly horrific tragedy, and there must be justice for all those who lost their lives on that sad day. »

The apparent death of many Federation leaders aboard Starship One resulted in Winters briefly becoming acting president, shortly before Hudson won a vote of no confidence. There has been much media attention regarding how this event proved pivotal to both of their political careers.


* Successful Initiatives to Produce New Starports
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

New starports to be constructed in 10 systems.

Two projects to resource the upgrading of refinery outposts into starports have concluded. The aim is to increase efficiency for fleet carrier owners who use large ships for transporting tritium fuel.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd published this statement from CEO Susannah Haynes:

« Thanks to a generous number of deliveries, we will have in place fully functioning Orbis starports for the start of October in the Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae and Potriti systems. »

« All participating traders can now collect their rewards at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system. »

A similar announcement came from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc:

« The many shipments that we received will enable us to provide new Coriolis stations in the LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin systems by the beginning of October. We hope these will provide services to travellers for many years to come. »

« Rewards for all pilots who delivered these minerals are now available at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system. »


* Obituary: Prince Harold Duval
The Imperial Herald has published an obituary of Prince Harold Duval, who was assassinated by NMLA terrorists.

« Born in 3230 to Emperor Hengist, Harold Duval reacted against his father's puritan lifestyle by filling his days with partying and debauchery, becoming the black sheep of the Duval family. »

« It was probably accidental that Harold had a child with entertainer Imogen Gabrielini, but they married shortly before her narcotics-related death. His daughter, Princess Aisling Duval, has always spoken warmly of her loving father. »

« Emperor Hengist eventually decreed that his son was not fit for the throne, despite being his only heir. Harold never contested this, perhaps relieved to allow half-sister Arissa Lavigny-Duval to take his place. »

« In recent years Harold became a recluse on Capitol, suffering ill-health from a lifetime of excesses. But a father's protective instinct motivated him to travel to Aisling's home system after it was attacked. Tragically, despite always renouncing power, merely being a Duval made him a target to those same republican terrorists. »

« As the Empire mourns Prince Harold, suspicions arise that the NMLA were aided by inside knowledge of his ship's itinerary and security, throwing an uneasy shadow over the legacy of this eccentric, endearing man. »


* State Funeral Held for Prince Harold Duval
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

Rare commodities required by the Empire in the Baal system.

The state funeral of Prince Harold Duval has begun on Capitol. An official week of mourning has been declared throughout the Empire.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval opened the ceremony, delivering a eulogy for her half-brother. Princess Aisling Duval, Harold's daughter, was also in attendance but was too emotional to address the huge crowds.

Messages of condolence from across the galaxy were on holographic display, including from Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Federal President Zachary Hudson. Even Hadrian Duval, the exiled leader of Nova Imperium, paid respects to his late uncle.

The body of the Prince, contained within a jewelled transparent casket, was paraded through the city by a company of Imperial Guard. It will remain in state for two weeks prior to internment in the Hall of Martyrs.

The Imperial Palace will host a memorial ceremony to honour Harold Duval, for which rare commodities have been requested before Thursday 1st October. Ngadandari Fire Opals, Esuseku Caviar, Lavian Brandy and Kamitra Cigars should be delivered to Oterma Station in the Baal system, where the White Templars will transport them to Capitol after security vetting.

Commanders of the Pilots Federation will be assigned an Achenar system permit alongside financial rewards. To further encourage participation, Gutamaya Corporation will apply a discount of up to 25% for all ship purchases according to the amount of rare items provided.


* Starship One Trial Begins
The trial of Chief Technician Rory Webster, who is charged with mass murder and attempted treason, began today at the Federal High Court on Mars.

Mr Webster, a department head in the Federal Navy Engineering Corps, is accused of attempting to destroy Starship One in 3301. He has filed a plea of not guilty.

The prosecutor laid out the charges, including this summary:

« According to the testimonies of three naval engineers, they installed replacement power regulator components to Starship One prior to its launch. Mr Webster verified this was routine maintenance during the initial investigation. »

« Last year, one engineer reviewed data for the Highliner Antares incident and realised that pre-modified power regulators could have caused an identical Frame Shift Drive misjump on Starship One. She tried to trace the components' source and found the records deleted. »

« After Mr Webster refused to respond to her questions, she and her colleagues contacted the authorities, prompting a full inquiry. »

The Highliner Antares was a Sirius Corporation passenger liner that was destroyed in 3251 when its experimental hyperdrive engines malfunctioned.

The defence refuted the accusations as unprovable and motivated by personal grudges, making reference to Chief Technician Webster's otherwise flawless record.

The trial is expected to conclude next week.


* Imperial Crackdown on Marlinists
Senator Denton Patreus has mobilised Imperial military forces in response to terrorist acts committed by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA).

The Empire has declared martial law and a lockdown in Ackwada, Beatis Chana and Nahuatl, where the republican ideals of Marlinism are known to be popular. Imperial Army troops have replaced local security forces, and potential NMLA sympathisers are being arrested for interrogation.

Senator Patreus received applause in the Imperial Senate when he vowed:

« There will be justice for the murder of Prince Harold Duval and justice for those citizens who perished in flames. The Marlinists will pay dearly for these atrocities! »

In related news, the Imperial Internal Security Service issued a report regarding the NMLA's recent attacks on starports:

« Forensic results confirm that much of the station damage was caused by Thargoid caustic enzymes. Fragments indicate that the bombs were of advanced design but definitely man-made, not Thargoid in origin. Their payloads were identical in composition to enzyme missile rack warheads. »

« Our deduction is that the portable explosives were smuggled onto all four starports, then remotely detonated as one coordinated strike. We are interviewing station personnel and analysing recent traffic to identify any patterns. »


* Engineer Linked to Terrorist Weapons
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

Conflict between Keltim Empire League and Eurybia Blue Mafia in the Eurybia system.

Explosive devices used in recent terrorist attacks on four Imperial starports have been linked to Liz Ryder, an engineer based in the Eurybia system.

The Imperial Internal Security Service published this report:

« Analysis of station traffic revealed that the explosives were delivered on cargo transports linked to the Eurybia Blue Mafia, a notorious anarchist organisation that we have reason to believe is secretly supplying the NMLA. »

« The Eurybia Blue Mafia is protecting demolitions expert Liz Ryder, who we strongly suspect designed the specialist weapons used in the starport bombings. As they have refused to cooperate, a state of war has been declared until she is surrendered to our custody. »

« Our affiliate faction, the Keltim Empire League, has requested the support of independent pilots against any resisting anarchist forces. »

Ana Westergard, a spokesperson for the Eurybia Blue Mafia, broadcast this emergency message:

« This is an outrageous invasion by the Empire! We categorically deny any involvement with the NMLA. I urgently call upon our supporters \u2013 and anyone who cares about freedom \u2013 to help us defend Liz Ryder as well as our independence. »

Engineering services are still available at the Demolition Unlimited workshop, with Liz Ryder communicating remotely from a place of safety.


* Rare Goods Delivered for Harold Duval's Memorial Ceremony
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

Memorial preparations complete.

A request by the Empire to honour the passing of Prince Harold Duval with rare items has received an impressive response, earning the gratitude of the Imperial Family.

Shipments of Ngadandari Fire Opals, Esuseku Caviar, Lavian Brandy and Kamitra Cigars were transported to the memorial ceremony at the Imperial Palace on Capitol. The body of the Prince will remain in state for another week, prior to reaching its final resting place within the Hall of Martyrs.

Pilots who delivered these commodities can now collect their rewards at Oterma Station in the Baal system.

Achenar system permits will be processed and automatically allocated by the 3rd of October 3306.

In recognition of this achievement, Gutamaya Corporation ships will be available at a 20% discount from the 2nd of October 3306 to the 9th of October 3306.

Princess Aisling Duval told the media:

« I wish to thank everyone for their kindness during this difficult time. I've taken much comfort from knowing that my father will never be forgotten. »

« For now, I want to make it clear that all efforts to eliminate the brutal terrorists responsible for his death have my full support. I urge every citizen to reject the destructive dogma of Marlinism and work together for a stronger Empire. »


* New Starports Become Operational
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

New starports constructed in ten systems causing increased commodity demand.

Several refinery outposts have now been upgraded to starports, following an initiative to improve access to large ships for refuelling fleet carriers.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd has completed construction of the following Orbis starports:

Harper Plant in the Fjorgyn system

Iqbal Hub in the HR 4979 system

Stephenson Dock in the Wolf 294 system

McQuarrie Landing in the Lambda-2 Tucanae system

Hartsfield Plant in the Potriti system

The following Coriolis starports have been constructed by Steel Castle Inc:

Rorschach Hub in the LHS 4058 system

Chargaff Installation in the Chakpa system

Nagata Vision in the Gally Bese system

Reilly Plant in the Eta Cephei system

Trevithick Vision in the Ninabin system

As a result of the community drives to build these starports, there have been fluctuations on the trading market. The availability of several commodities has been reduced, resulting in increased prices and profit margins. The items affected include:

Bauxite

Building fabricators

Gallite

Power generators

Rutile

Thermal cooling units


* Revelation Halts Starship One Trial
The Federal High Court trial over the destruction of Starship One has been temporarily halted following a proffered confession from the defendant.

Chief Technician Rory Webster is charged with mass murder and treason, with testimonials claiming that he ordered his engineering team to sabotage Starship One's hyperdrive systems.

Crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported for The Federal Times:

« Despite a spirited performance from the defence, highlighting the absence of a sufficient motive, Mr Webster visibly struggled in the dock last week as the technical evidence mounted. Several jury members nodded when the prosecutor called for the death sentence, should the accused be found guilty of slaughtering hundreds. »

« The judge was about to begin her summation, when Mr Webster's defence counsel announced that the defendant now wished to change his plea to guilty and make a full confession in return for clemency, claiming that he had acted on 'orders from the top'. »

« There was much discussion between the judge and legal representatives. Eventually it was agreed that the trial would be suspended while Mr Webster's testimony was taken by the Federal Intelligence Agency, and then a suitable course of action would follow. »

The Federal Attorney's Office stated that a decision on resuming the trial is expected within a few days.


* Military Strike Against Marlinist Faction
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Conflict between Regulatory State of Ackwada and Duduseklis Empire League in the Ackwada system.

The Empire has targeted a Marlinist faction that is suspected of supporting the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA). It was recently placed into lockdown for its pro-Marlinist stance, during which time suspicions were raised of it having a direct connection to the NMLA.

The Imperial Internal Security Service made this statement:

« The Duduseklis Empire League is one of several organisations that publicly accepted the principles of Marlinism. Our intelligence suggests it is allowing the NMLA to radicalise its citizens into becoming activists for the paramilitary group. »

« Operations to investigate this potential nest of terrorists have been met with armed resistance. Imperial auxiliaries and independent pilots are requested to assist the Regulatory State of Ackwada in defeating all pro-Marlinist forces in the Ackwada system. »

The Duduseklis Empire League broadcast this message:

« If NMLA members have been recruited from our people, it is certainly not with our knowledge. The Empire is using a terrorist hunt to justify persecuting millions of ordinary citizens, whose only crime is to believe in republican ideals. »

« We remain loyal to the Emperor, but are forced to counter this unwarranted aggression to ensure these political refugees escape imprisonment. The stronger our resistance, the more megaships can flee this system. We desperately need help so we can transport thousands of innocent families to safety. »


* Eurybia Blue Mafia Resists Imperial Forces
*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders*

Conflict between Keltim Empire League and Eurybia Blue Mafia in Eurybia has ended.

The Eurybia Blue Mafia has successfully fought off an attempt by the Empire to take the Engineer Liz Ryder into custody.

Spokesperson Ana Westergard made this announcement on behalf of the anarchist faction:

« This is a victory against the Empire's arrogance! There was never any evidence that Liz Ryder or our organisation are involved with terrorists, and this invasion was based entirely on supposition. »

« We are extremely grateful to everyone who helped us defend Liz Ryder and maintain our independence. Rewards to all those brave Commanders are available at Awyra Flirble starport, modules will be placed in storage by the 10th of October 3306 ».

Captain Rocco Gandara of the Keltim Empire League announced:

« Despite the anarchists having the upper hand on this occasion, I can confirm that we will honour all of our supporting pilots by making rewards available at Prelude to Victory. »


* Fleet Admiral Vincent Named as Starship One Saboteur
Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent, one of the Federal Navy chiefs of staff, has been arrested on charges related to the destruction of Starship One.

The trial of Chief Technician Rory Webster was halted by a plea bargain to reveal who ordered him to sabotage Starship One's hyperdrive in 3301.

An update on proceedings was delivered by Milandu Okoro of the Federal Attorney's Office:

« Mr Webster provided evidence that Fleet Admiral Vincent directly commanded him to arrange for Starship One to suffer the same fate as the Highliner Antares. The orders were allegedly provided on a private channel, accompanied by threats discouraging Mr Webster's refusal. »

« The trial concluded with the judge summarily convicting the defendant of aiding and abetting mass murder. Chief Technician Webster received a lenient sentence of 20 years in prison, in acknowledgement that he performed criminal acts under duress. »

« The FIA has detained Vincent in a high-security facility, and he has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and treason. However, the case is likely to take several months to come to trial. »

There was no comment from President Zachary Hudson, who is believed to be a personal friend of Vincent. A spokesperson for his administration said: « As always, the President has full confidence in our court system to deliver justice. »


* Engineer Reveals Link to Terrorist Bombs
Liz Ryder, an engineer based in the Eurybia system, has confirmed that her designs for an explosive match those used by NMLA terrorists against Imperial starports.

Her statement was distributed by Vox Galactica:

« Under a private contract from what appeared to be the Eurybia Blue Mafia, I designed demolition charges capable of delivering a secondary payload. At no point did I know these would be customised to hold Thargoid caustic enzymes or used in terrorist activities. Until recently, I had no idea that the starport bombings were caused by modified versions of my design. »

« I have since discovered that my contractors used false identification, and now seem to be untraceable. It appears that the NMLA, or people working for them, infiltrated the Eurybia Blue Mafia to access my services. »

« To help clear the Eurybia Blue Mafia, which has supported me for years, I have provided Imperial investigators with all the data I have regarding this contract. I urge the Empire to accept that we were all deceived by the terrorists. »

The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that the warrant for Liz Ryder's arrest has been rescinded and it is reviewing her information, which may lead to locating the source of the Thargoid enzymes used in the bombs.


* Marlinist Faction Blockaded by Empire
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Conflict between Regulatory State of Ackwada and Duduseklis Empire League in the Ackwada system has concluded.

A Marlinist faction accused for providing recruits to the NMLA terrorist group has been overwhelmed by a combination of Imperial forces and independent pilots. Several megaships were intercepted while attempting to transport large numbers of Marlinist civilians out of the Ackwada system.

This report was delivered by the Imperial Internal Security Service:

« We have taken many Marlinist criminals into custody, despite their efforts to shield the terrorists. Some may have temporarily evaded us, but we are confident that we can track and destroy the NMLA cells operating within this system. »

« Our affiliate, the Regulatory State of Ackwada, will distribute rewards at Glorious Destiny to all who contributed to this victory. »

The Duduseklis Empire League broadcast this message to its supporters:

« Thousands of political refugees attempted to flee from persecution onboard megaships. Unfortunately, the Imperial blockade was supported by too many independent pilots, and none were able to escape. »

« Despite being unable to help our Marlinist supporters, we are still able to offer rewards at Rush's Camp for the brave few who dared to dream of democracy. »

Imperial scouts are currently searching for many smaller vessels that fled the system and may contain NMLA activists.


* Thargoids Return to Witch Head Nebula
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Thargoid vessels detected in Alliance-controlled systems within the Witch Head Nebula.

The Thargoids have reappeared in the Witch Head Nebula, and are swarming in large numbers through the Onoros, Lembass, Haki, Wellington and Shenve systems.

Sixteen systems within the nebula were colonised last year to form the Witch Head Enclave, after a successful initiative to locate fresh barnacle sites. This initially triggered a hostile reaction from the Thargoids, but their presence was relatively low until now.

Captain Warren Lamar, head of security for the Alliance Expeditionary Pact, put out an urgent call for assistance:

« If this Thargoid assault is not repelled, it may spread into a full-scale invasion throughout the Witch Head Enclave. Neither Aegis nor the Alliance Defence Force are able to deploy in time, so we ask all independent combat pilots and anti-xeno squadrons to come to our defence. »

The Alliance Expeditionary Pact has confirmed that it will offer generous rewards to all Commanders who assist with destroying Thargoid vessels.

In related news, the technology broker at Bray Landing in the Yuanjia system will support pilots by reducing resource requirements to access Guardian weapons and modules.


* Marlinist Exodus as Imperial Lockdowns Continue
The Empire has locked down more systems as part of an anti-terrorism operation, causing millions of Marlinists to flee from their homes.

Following NMLA terror attacks, martial law was declared in regions where the political beliefs of Marlinism are prevalent.

Citizens in several systems including 234 G. Carinae, Baltah'Sine, Beatis, CD-39 3269, Chana, HIP 39470, Mazahuanses and Nahuatl have evacuated en masse to avoid arrest. There are eyewitness reports of people crammed into whatever vessels they can find, often in unsafe numbers.

Vox Galactica featured this statement from Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader and advocate of democratic reform:

« This isn't a search for terrorists \u2013 it's a crusade against anyone who shares Marlin Duval's dream of a Republic. Such brutal persecution leaves us no choice but to risk our lives by seeking sanctuary elsewhere. »

In the Senate, a handful of senators voiced concerns about the treatment of Imperial citizens, to which Denton Patreus responded:

« The security of the Empire is paramount. These worlds harbour a ruthless enemy that has already slaughtered thousands. We will not rest until the Neo-Marlinist poison has been cleansed, even if that means tracking down everyone who may carry this infection. »

The Imperial Navy is searching for all ships transporting Marlinist refugees, but there is evidence that some have reached systems controlled by the Federation.


* Political Turmoil for President Hudson
Political support for Federal President Zachary Hudson has plummeted after the results of a trial concerning Starship One's destruction.

Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent was charged with sabotaging the presidential vessel, leading to hundreds of deaths. His close relationship with Hudson has triggered a public outcry and accusations of a conspiracy to assassinate then-President Jasmina Halsey.

Political analyst Vihaan Niven reported on the situation:

« The Republican Party is officially in a state of crisis. President Hudson has refused to make any statement regarding Fleet Admiral Vincent, despite pressure piling up from all corners of the Federation. Over a dozen congressmen have resigned in protest, refusing to be associated with what some newsfeeds are calling 'the crime of the century'. »

« Shadow President Felicia Winters has stopped short of making direct allegations against Hudson but, in several powerful speeches, she stressed that no elected ruler can ever be above the law. »

« Opinion polls suggest that the Liberal Party now has majority support for the first time in years, and that many people view Hudson as a symbol of corruption. In 3305, halfway through his term of office, the President won the scheduled congressional vote of no confidence by a slim margin. It is doubtful that his administration would survive if it were to be held today. »


* Marlinist Refugees Flee to the Federation
The Empire has formally demanded that the Federation extradites all Marlinist political refugees that have fled into their space.

Hundreds of thousands of believers in the republican ideology evacuated their homes following anti-terrorism lockdowns. The Imperial blockade in Ackwada prevented ten megaships from escaping, but others carrying huge numbers of Marlinists have appeared in the Federal systems Charunder, Ennead, HIP 36081, LTT 1935, LTT 3607 and Thetis. Many smaller vessels are also thought to have spread far and wide.

Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana sent the formal request:

« The Federation is harbouring potential criminals who are connected to the NMLA terrorists. We insist that they are detained and returned to us to face justice. »

Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, who was once engaged to Princess Aisling Duval, provided an official response:

« There is no extradition treaty for unconvicted citizens, and these people have claimed political asylum. I have requested that Congress grant them sanctuary within the Federation, and that we offer protection to all Marlinists seeking to escape discrimination by the Empire. »

Although there is no indication that Marlinist emigrants have set course for Alliance space, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon confirmed that they will be welcomed. Some independent systems are also offering assistance, while others have warned that any influx of refugees will be resisted.


* Thargoid Incursion Repelled in Witch Head Enclave
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Thargoid forces defeated in an Alliance-controlled system within the Witch Head Nebula.

The galactic community has responded to a call for aid from the Witch Head Enclave and successfully resisted an attack by the Thargoids. The majority of the alien vessels were destroyed, forcing the remainder to retreat.

Captain Warren Lamar, head of security for the Alliance Expeditionary Pact, announced:

« Everyone in Onoros and our neighbouring systems owes an enormous debt to the courageous pilots who met the Thargoids in battle. The whole of the Witch Head Enclave is breathing a sigh of relief that this resurgence was prevented from spreading any farther. »

The Alliance Expeditionary Pact offered financial rewards for those who took part in the system's defence, and these payments can now be obtained at the Golden Stag.

To help celebrate this victory, the technology broker at Bray Landing in the Yuanjia system confirmed that access to Guardian weapons and modules will stay reduced for one more week.


* Federal Initiative to Support Marlinist Refugees
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An aid charity is requesting deliveries of vital supplies to help Marlinist refugees that fled from the Empire to the Federation.

Safeguard Interstellar, a humanitarian aid organisation, has announced a campaign to help refugees requesting political asylum in the Federation.

Several Imperial factions sympathetic to Marlinism were placed under martial law, leading to civilians emigrating in huge numbers to the Federal systems Charunder, Ennead, HIP 36081, LTT 1935, LTT 3607 and Thetis. Local authorities have warned that without additional support, these refugees may trigger public unrest or food shortages. There is also a risk of unfamiliar contagions reaching the population.

Noel Beaumont, the CEO of Safeguard Interstellar, made this statement:

« These ex-citizens of the Empire have suffered at the hands of their own government, and now seek freedom from persecution. Shelter, food and other necessities must be provided to satisfy their basic human rights. »

« We urgently require shipments of basic medicines, clothing, food cartridges, fruit and vegetables, and evacuation shelters to Fox Enterprise in the LFT 625 system. From there, they will be distributed to the Marlinists. The more supplies we receive, the more systems can offer sanctuary without strain on their infrastructure. »

Safeguard Interstellar's affiliate, the Fionn Liberals, has offered to pay handsomely for all bounty vouchers collected from wanted vessels in the LFT 625 system.

The initiative begins on the 22nd of October 3306 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.


* Congress Votes to Accept Marlinist Immigrants
The Federation will grant sanctuary to Marlinist political refugees from the Empire, following a congressional vote in favour of Felicia Winters.

President Zachary Hudson had stated that illegal immigrants in the Federal systems Charunder, Ennead, HIP 36081, LTT 1935, LTT 3607 and Thetis would be detained and returned to Imperial space. This was challenged by Shadow President Felicia Winters, who argued that they deserved a more compassionate response.

Congress debated and then voted on her proposal, which received majority support. Government funding will soon be released to provide resources and accommodation for the refugee population.

Shadow President Winters told the media:

« Charities such as Safeguard Interstellar are already doing excellent work, but now we can officially offer safe haven and temporary citizenship to all Marlinists. »

 « These innocent people only seek what we in the Federation take for granted \u2013 democracy, fairness and political representation. Their values are closer to ours than the Empire's, and we have an obligation to protect them. »

Several newsfeeds, including The Federal Times and Sol Today, commented that President Hudson's authority has been undermined by his refusal to comment on the charges against Fleet Admiral Vincent. The accompanying rumours of corruption and conspiracy have had a demoralising effect on his supporters, and increased the Liberal Party's popularity.


* Terrorist Hit Squad Targets Hadrian Duval
Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has been severely wounded in an assassination attempt by Neo-Marlinist extremists.

The attack took place at Dyson City in the Paresa system, headquarters of the isolationist organisation Nova Imperium. A small team of armed intruders broke into the command deck and opened fire. Three people were killed and four injured, including Hadrian Duval, before his Praetorian Guard eliminated the assassins.

The NMLA has claimed responsibility. On propaganda channels, the paramilitary group vows to « sever every head of the Duval hydra », and calls for all citizens to rise up and demand democracy.

Praetor Leo Magnus, Nova Imperium's head of security, gave this statement to Vox Galactica:

« The Imperator is in a critical condition but receiving our finest medical care. I am personally overseeing an investigation into how the NMLA infiltrated our starport and bypassed security checks. »

« Such attacks are as sickening as they are cowardly, and Nova Imperium stands firmly against these terrorists. »

Hadrian Duval is the illegitimate grandson of Emperor Hengist. His father, the late Commander Hector Jansen, was the result of a secret liaison with a household slave. Although disowned by the Imperial Family, Hadrian claims to be a rightful heir to the throne.


* Supplies for Marlinist Refugees Successfully Delivered
A Federal charity initiative to deliver vital supplies for Marlinist refugees from the Empire has concluded.

Safeguard Interstellar, a humanitarian aid organisation, received an impressive response to its request to provide basic necessities to Marlinist immigrants claiming asylum in the Federation.

CEO Noel Beaumont announced:

« These much-needed shipments of basic medicines, clothing, food cartridges, fruit and vegetables, and evacuation shelters will be used to sustain the Marlinist populations in the LTT 3607, Charunder and Ennead systems, at least until they can receive the state support granted by Congress. »

« Our affiliate, the Fionn Liberals, will be pleased to reward contributing pilots at Fox Enterprise in the LFT 625 system. »

The charity shared a message from Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader:

« To all the pilots who brought these life-saving supplies \u2013 thank you. Leaving our homes has been incredibly difficult, but you and Safeguard Interstellar have provided ports in the storm. Many of us hope to start afresh in the Federation, where we know our democratic ideals will be nourished. »


* 'Ghost Ship' Arrives in Chukchan System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An abandoned megaship that set out two centuries ago has returned on automatic pilot to the Chukchan system.

Local security forces were scrambled to intercept an unidentified vessel that was detected on a collision course with Chukchan 5 B.

The megaship displayed no signs of life, so tugs were deployed to wrench it into a safe orbit. This caused onboard power systems to overload with explosive results, damaging cargo holds and spilling debris.

The name of the ship was confirmed as the Adamastor, but no further information is available in the public domain.

Specialists from the Alliance Salvage Guild boarded the derelict to conduct an investigation. Their preliminary report stated:

« The Adamastor has been travelling at sublight speed through interstellar space for nearly two hundred years. There are no remains of the crew. All escape pods and secondary craft have been launched, and several airlocks were manually opened from within. »

« A complete absence of identification suggests that this ship was intended for clandestine operations. All data drives have been deliberately erased. »

« There is evidence of a reinforced cargo hold, fitted with what looks like the remains of environmental equipment. Recent fire damage makes it impossible to be more specific. »

« The ship's original destination is unknown, having returned to its launch point on autopilot. Calculating its trajectory implies that it passed near the HIP 61595, HIP 64011 and HIP 65201 systems. »

The Adamastor will remain in orbit for further examination.


* Empire and Federation Clash Over Marlinists
The Empire has repeated its demand for the Federation to deport all Marlinist emigrants, as tensions increase between the two superpowers.

Hundreds of thousands of political refugees reached Federal space after fleeing to escape the Empire's hunt for Neo-Marlinist terrorists. Congress has agreed to provide sanctuary, along with offers of permanent residency.

Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana stated:

« Our people must be safely returned so we can identify dangerous NMLA activists, before they gain the opportunity to inflict further harm. We have no desire for the Federation to suffer the same horrific attacks. »

A response was given by Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester:

« As always, the Empire promises one thing and does another. This is not an altruistic effort to spare us from terrorists \u2013 it is a totalitarian purge of believers in democracy. »

There are reports that both superpowers have suspended many official channels of communication. Political commentators have observed that the Federation's actions could be construed as the mass kidnapping of Imperial citizens, which would be an act of war.


* Hadrian Duval Saved by Aisling Duval's Intervention
Princess Aisling Duval has provided lifesaving aid to Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, who was severely wounded by NMLA terrorists.

The INV Achenar's Courage, transported her to the Paresa system where she offered protection against further assassination attempts.

Hadrian Duval was transferred to the Majestic-class Interdictor's medical bay, surrounded by both his Praetorian Guard and Imperial troops. He received advanced treatment including Vitadyne nanomeds, and is no longer in critical condition.

This unorthodox intervention has drawn both criticism and praise from senators and public alike. Nova Imperium is outlawed for sedition due to its isolationist policies, and its leader is not recognised by the Imperial Family. However, a non-aggression pact was agreed between Aisling and Hadrian in 3305.

A defiant Aisling Duval told The Imperial Herald:

« I recently lost one member of my family to these extremists. I am not about to lose another. Regardless of politics, Hadrian is my cousin, and there are precious few Duvals left alive. »

Nova Imperium's head of security, Praetor Leo Magnus, commented:

« I am confident that our Imperator would have survived, but we do appreciate Her Highness's assistance. It remains a mystery how the NMLA could come so close to succeeding, but my investigations continue. »


* Federation Accused of Supporting the NMLA
The Empire has revealed new evidence that suggests the NMLA terrorist group may be receiving help from elements within the Federation.

A report from the Imperial Internal Security Service stated:

« With information provided by the engineer Liz Ryder, we located an abandoned workshop where explosives had been constructed using her blueprints. Traces were found of Thargoid caustic enzymes, matching the payloads delivered during the starport bombings. »

« Micro-signage on cargo containers identified bulk deliveries of equipment from a Federal system in neutral space, where we believe the NMLA has a second bomb-making facility. IISS agents are currently investigating to confirm these findings. »

Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester refuted these allegations:

« The suggestion that we're responsible for the Empire's home-grown extremists is laughable. As with their persecution of Marlinists, this is another excuse for an inability to solve their own problems. »

Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana responded:

« There have long been rumours that the NMLA has the Federation's support, to destabilise the Empire and promote republican propaganda. If true, there will be severe consequences. »

In related news, some Federal systems are struggling to cope with an influx of Marlinist refugees. Public disobedience, food shortages and epidemics have been reported in the Thetis, LTT 1935 and HIP 36081 systems, due to a lack of additional resources.


* Federal and Imperial Forces Engage in Battle
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Empire's counter-terrorism operation in the LTT 1935 system has triggered armed resistance from the Federation.

The Imperial Internal Security Service's investigation into the NMLA terrorist group led its agents to LTT 1935, a Federation-controlled system in neutral space. Military vessels were called in for support, only to be met in combat by Federal forces.

A declaration was made by Colonel Ernest Harris of the LTT 1935 Confederacy:

« The Empire cannot dominate and arrest our citizens as it did with the Marlinists. We claim the right to defend the Federation's territory from such aggressive tactics. »

Captain Axel Cyprian of the L.Y.S Corp responded:

« The IISS has confirmed that the Neo-Marlinists have secret bomb-making factories concealed within LTT 1935. To prevent future atrocities, it is vital that we take control of this system and shut down the NMLA's source of weapons. »

The LTT 1935 Confederacy has requested help from independent pilots to defend LTT 1935 from occupation by the Empire.

The L.Y.S Corp has also asked for auxiliaries to assist in gaining control of the system.


* Terrorism Spreads as Superpower Conflicts Increase
Neo-Marlinist extremists are continuing their campaign of terror, while the Empire and Federation clash over issues caused by Marlinist refugees.

The Imperial Herald has featured updates on terrorist activity across the Empire:

« The NMLA has claimed responsibility for over fifty bomb attacks during the last three weeks. These mostly targeted local authority buildings and security forces, killing hundreds. Hit squads have also assassinated several high-profile individuals connected to the Duvals, including the Emperor's relative Baron Cesare Lavigny. »

« Senior IISS leaders have admitted to being unprepared for how organised and well-equipped the paramilitary group is. Critics suggest that the mass arrest of Marlinists may have radicalised many people who were already sympathetic to the republican ideology. »

The Federal Times has focused on the tensions between superpowers:

« With diplomatic channels closing down, the possibility that the confrontation in LTT 1935 might escalate into all-out war cannot be ignored. There is added pressure from the exodus of millions of Marlinists, whose beliefs align with the Federation's democratic principles. »

« President Hudson is still suffering from reduced congressional support, and many have said that it feels like Felicia Winters is running the show. But although her humanitarian efforts undoubtedly saved many refugees' lives, the acceptance of Imperial outcasts into Federal society remains in question. »


* 'Ghost Ship' Leads Alliance to New Resources
Discoveries made two hundred years ago by an abandoned megaship have revealed untapped sources of meta-alloys within the Coalsack Nebula.

The Adamastor, which was launched in 3111, returned to the Chukchan system from the Coalsack Nebula on autopilot with no traces of its crew. Thargoid barnacle sites were found in the nebula by independent pilots.

The Alliance Assembly has announced an expedition to thoroughly explore the nebula, with the primary goal of securing fresh sources of meta-alloys. A press release stated:

« Recent Thargoid activity in the Witch Head Nebula and over-exploitation of that region mean that this latest discovery has come at an opportune time. The Coalsack Nebula will now be the focus of an initiative to identify sites of commercial and scientific interest. To achieve this, we have established new partnerships with several corporations including Sirius Atmospherics. »

« Although the mystery of the Adamastor may never be fully resolved, we hope it will leave a positive legacy for the people of the Alliance. »

Mention of corporate partnerships caused ripples in certain industries, with speculation that these have been in the pipeline for months. Political commentators also observed that 3307 will be an election year for the Alliance, placing pressure on Prime Minister Edmund Mahon to secure economic stability.


* Hadrian Duval Seeks Reintegration with the Empire
Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has recovered from an assassination attempt and signalled a new direction for Nova Imperium.

Princess Aisling Duval provided advanced medical care for Imperator Duval after a near-fatal attack by NMLA assassins. Following a period of discussion, she told the media:

« At this time of crisis we need allies more than ever, and my cousin's royal heritage should not be denied. I have therefore formally requested sovereign consent for him to be accepted into the Imperial Family as Prince Hadrian. »

Hadrian Duval broadcast this message from Dyson City:

« I owe my life to Aisling, but life without purpose means nothing, and the Duvals' purpose has always been to protect the Empire. I seek to adopt my birthright and help defend our traditional ways of life. »

« However, many of us see disturbing parallels between the brutal purge of Nova Imperium's followers in 3305 and the current crusade against the Marlinists. I call upon those in power not to repeat this mistake \u2013 the NMLA is the common enemy we must unite against. »

Many senators publicly agreed that the Empire must heal past divisions to focus on the Neo-Marlinist threat. Others have voiced concerns at the repercussions of Emperor Hengist's illegitimate grandson becoming an heir to the throne. As yet, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has not responded.


* Alliance Launches Coalsack Nebula Campaign
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Commodities and anti-xeno support are requested as the Alliance begins exploitation of the Coalsack Nebula.

The Alliance plans to construct several new outposts in the Coalsack Nebula. From these, commercial and scientific operations will be conducted to locate fresh sources of meta-alloys and other potential sites of interest.

The initiative was prompted by the findings of a planetary survey team two hundred years ago, which were only discovered after an abandoned megaship arrived in the Chukchan system.

Shipments of power generators, robotics, structural regulators and building fabricators are required, and can be delivered to the megaship Spirit of Nysa in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system. The more commodities that are supplied, the more outposts will be upgraded to starports and the greater the range of services they will offer.

Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force discussed security arrangements:

« We anticipate a heavy Thargoid presence within the Coalsack Nebula. Therefore it is a strategic necessity that we act now to curtail the threat to future exploration. »

« Independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons can serve the Alliance by focusing their efforts on the Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9, Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, Musca Dark Region IM-V c2-24 and Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 systems, which will host the new structures. »


* Federal System Resists Imperial Takeover
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Federation has successfully maintained control of the LTT 1935 system, following a battle against local Imperial forces. The conflict was caused by an Imperial investigation that traced deliveries of bomb-making materials from this system to an NMLA workshop.

Colonel Ernest Harris of the LTT 1935 Confederacy stated:

« The LTT 1935 system remains part of the Federation, now that we have defended against the Empire's attempt to take control. Our citizens have been saved from the indignities of Imperial interrogation. »

« In gratitude to the Federal auxiliaries and independent pilots who helped support our freedom, rewards are now available at Wolf Port . »

There was also a message from Captain Axel Cyprian of the L.Y.S Corp:

« This is a serious setback in our war against the NMLA terrorists, who the Federation seem eager to protect. Nevertheless, for all those courageous pilots who flew on our behalf, we can offer generous payments from Strength of Purpose. »


* Emperor Decides Hadrian Duval's Status
Princess Aisling Duval's request for her cousin, Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, to be accepted into the Imperial Family has been denied.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's decision was delivered to the Senate by Chancellor Anders Blaine:

« Her Majesty acknowledges that Hadrian is a Duval by blood, and offers royal pardons to him and his followers for previous crimes against the Empire. However, she does not bestow upon him the title of prince, nor offer any formal position within the Imperial Family. »

Aisling Duval and Hadrian Duval both expressed disappointment, but agreed to accept the decree. The Senate has now ratified the Treaty of Paresa, which removes Nova Imperium's outlaw status in return for accepting Emperor Arissa's rule and contributing to operations against the NMLA.

The Imperial Herald's political journalist Cassia Carvalho commented:

« This surprisingly even-handed judgement is widely seen as bowing to pressure from the Senate, where there is much loyalty to Aisling Duval. Some interpret it as atonement \u2013 or regaining political goodwill \u2013 for the purge of Nova Imperium in 3305, which included the execution of several senators. »

« The image this projects is of an Empire coming together against the greater threat posed by Neo-Marlinists. But there is speculation that an alliance between the two youngest Duvals may one day challenge the Emperor for the throne. »


* Coalsack Nebula Campaign Completes Initial Stages
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An Alliance initiative has successfully prepared the Coalsack Nebula for exploitation and reduced the Thargoids' presence.

Traders delivered shipments of power generators, robotics, structural regulators and building fabricators, which will be used to help construct several new facilities in the region.

The quantity of commodities received will result in construction of the following for the 26th of November 3306:

Betancourt Base Starport in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.

Additional services: Interstellar factor, human technology broker, encoded material trader, extended range of Multi-purpose ships.

Cole Point Starport in the CoalSack Sector VU-0 B6-6 system.

Additional services: Interstellar factor, raw material trader, extended range of Multi-purpose ships and mining equipment, fleet carrier administration.

Hannu Arena Starport in the Musca Dark Region IM-V C2-24 system.

Additional services: Interstellar factor, range of combat ships and weapons.

Bering Port Starport in the CoalSack Sector KN-S B4-9 system.

Additional services: Interstellar factor, improved outfitting options, manufactured material trader.

Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force delivered an update on the security procedures:

« Our efforts to clear the systems of Thargoid vessels were hugely boosted by independent pilots. Their skills have enabled our transports to travel to the nebula in relative safety. »

The Alliance is collaborating with several corporations to investigate the Coalsack Nebula for commercial and scientific sites of interest.


* Terrorists Identified Among Marlinist Refugees
A screening process for Marlinist asylum-seekers arriving in the Federation has located several members of the NMLA terrorist group.

Vice President Brad Mitchell personally initiated a Federal Security Service operation to uncover any Neo-Marlinist extremists concealed among the refugee population.

The Vice President delivered this report to Congress:

« After standard ID scans flagged up some potential suspects, FSS officers employed more vigorous checks and interview techniques. They found nine individuals who were active members of the NMLA. »

« The terrorists have been transported to secure facilities for further interrogation, after which they will be handed over to Imperial authorities. Our security services remain vigilant against this danger that the Liberal Party has invited into our communities. »

 Vox Galactica featured a statement by Marlinist community leader Dr Jenna Fairfax:

« I am horrified to learn of NMLA hiding among us. These killers do not represent the principles of Marlinism, and we are happy to cooperate in expelling them. »

In related news, protestors on several Federal worlds have warned of increased crime, terrorism and economic damage unless all refugees are sent back to the Empire. Counter-protests have called for the Marlinists to be welcomed as fellow believers in democratic government.


* Terrorist Bombing at Federal Starport
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Multiple explosions have struck Kepler Orbital in the Atropos system, causing huge damage and loss of life.

Witnesses have observed signs of corrosion damage to the starport. This is characteristic of an explosive designed by the engineer Liz Ryder that deploys Thargoid caustic enzymes, and which was used in the bombings of Imperial starports in September.

The NMLA has claimed responsibility for the attack. Its propaganda channels praised « the nine martyrs », a reference to the terrorist suspects recently arrested by the Federal Security Service. There were also warnings of « further reprisals if the Federation impedes our cause ».

The FSS has since confirmed that the captive NMLA members were being held in secure facilities at Kepler Orbital, which have been completely destroyed by the blasts. It is assumed that they were specifically targeted to prevent the prisoners revealing information about the paramilitary group under interrogation.

Federal authorities are urgently requesting support from the galactic community, to assist with repair efforts and to rescue survivors still trapped at the damaged station.


* Superpowers React to Latest NMLA Strike
Relations between the Empire and the Federation have deteriorated following a terror attack by Neo-Marlinists against a Federal starport.

Kepler Orbital in the Atropos system was bombed by the NMLA to eliminate several of its captured members, before they could reveal anything under interrogation by the Federal Security Service.

Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana made this statement:

« The NMLA was obviously able to make use of its bomb-making factories within the LTT 1935 system. If the Federation had not resisted our investigation, we would have shut these down and prevented the attack. »

« Our warning about the extremist threat went unheeded, and the Federation is now paying the price. We once again insist that all Marlinists are repatriated to the Empire. »

Ambassador Jordan Rochester has not responded, but did confirm that Federal embassies in several Imperial systems have closed after violent anti-Marlinist protests placed diplomatic staff's lives at risk.

In Congress, Vice President Brad Mitchell directly blamed Shadow President Felicia Winters for the recent attack. He accused her of « laying out the welcome mat for terrorists » by offering sanctuary to the Marlinists. Other congressmen argued that she had prioritised aid for Imperial rather than Federal citizens.

There is evidence that Winters is now losing some of her recently gained political capital. However, the Liberal Party's popularity remains high in the wake of President Hudson's alleged association with the destruction of Starship One.


* Commodity Prices Affected by Market Volatility
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Volatile trading markets have caused widespread price changes on several commodities, with a focus on the mining sector.

Alongside general market instability, unprecedented stock levels for a range of mined materials such as painite \u2013 once the gold standard of many systems \u2013 mean they now have uncertain futures.

Many financial experts predicted this correction to the markets, and saw it as an inevitable change. Others see this as a direct result of escalating tensions between the Empire and the Federation, with a few dismissing it as a minor anomaly and that prices will rapidly return to normal.

Professor Ophelia Kaufmann, head of economics at Orion Independent University, observed:

« There is certainly historical precedent for volatile markets during periods of political instability. Whatever the real cause or outlook in the short term, commodity values have become far more susceptible to market forces. »

« This is a notoriously difficult field in which to make predictions, but it is likely that prices for some lower-value goods may increase. The only certainty is of further fluctuations, but their severity will largely depend on how the precarious situation between superpowers is resolved. »


* Core Dynamics Bids to Purchase Lakon Spaceways
An official bid for complete ownership of Lakon Spaceways has been made by Core Dynamics, a major shipbuilding corporation in the Federation.

The announcement caused ripples in the manufacturing sector, particularly as Lakon has been in partnership with the Alliance for several years.

The newsfeed Sol Today featured a statement by Jupiter Rochester, the CEO of Core Dynamics:

« Lakon Spaceways has made a name for itself with its practical and well-respected ship designs \u2013 the workhorses of the galaxy. Core Dynamics can help the company reach greater heights, and be even more successful. »

« This can only be a positive move for both corporations. As with our acquisition of Vodel last year, Lakon will retain its talented engineers and production facilities while operating under our guidance. »

There has been no response yet from the board of directors at Lakon Spaceways. Some industry specialists have speculated that the company may have financial difficulties, after investing heavily in the Alliance Chieftain and its sister ships.

Questions have been raised in the Alliance Assembly about the legality of inter-superpower corporate mergers. However, neither the Federal Commerce Authority nor the Independent Commission for Market Equality have disapproved of the proposal.


* Empire and Federation Increase Capital Ship Production
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Federal and Imperial Navies have both requested commodities for the construction of new capital ships.

President Zachary Hudson has convinced Congress to increase funding for the Federal Navy, and to advance the construction programme for Farragut-class Battle Cruisers. In a powerful address, he said:

« Defending the Federation is our highest priority in these uncertain times. It is vital that we reinforce our capability to protect the people from all threats. »

The Federal Navy urgently requires additional resources to meet the new shipbuilding timetable. Deliveries of building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies are requested at Schweickart City in the Parutis system.

A similar declaration was made in the Imperial Senate mere hours later, when Senator Denton Patreus announced:

« We face adversaries on all sides and from within, eager to corrupt and destroy our proud Empire. This is a time to bolster our strength and our resolve. »

The Imperial Navy confirmed that new Majestic-class Interdictors and other military vessels are being assembled. A request has been made for shipments of building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies to Miyasaka Orbital in the Mandh system.


* Alliance Consolidates Presence in Coalsack Nebula
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Alliance has opened new starports in the Coalsack Nebula, and is offering high prices for Thargoid-related commodities.

Following a successful campaign to establish a foothold in the nebula, the Alliance has announced that several new starports have become operational. These are:

Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.

Cole Point in the Coalsack Sector VU-0 B6-6 system.

Hannu Arena in the Musca Dark Region IM-V C2-24 system.

Bering Port in the Coalsack Sector KN-S B4-9 system.

The starports will serve as launchpads for further exploration of the region. Several corporations are working in partnership with the Alliance to locate commercial and scientific sites of interest.

One of the new research stations, Betancourt Base, has requested deliveries of Thargoid commodities. Chief xenobiologist Dr Rodion Stathos outlined the offer:

« The Thargoids have been in the Coalsack Nebula for at least two hundred years, giving us an opportunity to increase our understanding of this alien species. Thanks to funding provided by pharmaceutical and bioengineering companies, we can offer generous rewards for shipments of Thargoid biological matter and other artefacts. »


* The Shadow of War
NMLA terrorist attacks and the Marlinist refugee crisis have driven an increase in military spending from both the Empire and the Federation.

The Federal Times has reported on President Zachary Hudson's actions:

« Building on the public outcry following the Neo-Marlinist bombing of a Federal starport, President Hudson has positioned himself once again as the Federation's strongman. This is clearly a calculated effort to regain political power after negative associations from the Starship One trial. »

« Shadow President Felicia Winters's acceptance of Marlinist refugees has lost popularity, now that terrorists concealed among them have murdered thousands. However, cooler heads in Congress agree that provoking the Empire could lead to a far greater death toll. »

The Empire's response mirrored its counterpart, as observed by The Imperial Herald:

« As well as the construction of new capital ships, Senator Denton Patreus has also ordered the withdrawal of funding for Aegis. The Senate's consensus is that since Thargoid activity has reduced, the focus should now be on the Federation as well as the internal threat of the NMLA. »

« Cooperation between the superpowers is rapidly coming to an end, leading to a state of interstellar brinkmanship. There is a real possibility that the Neo-Marlinists' demand for revolutionary change may have broader repercussions than they intended. »


* Bounty Voucher Boost to Increase Local Security
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Bounty hunters are advised that credit rewards for successfully destroyed targets have been increased.

With the widespread redirection of resources toward faction and superpower militaries, local security forces are struggling to provide effective intra-system policing. Coupled with a rise in piracy and violent crime, this has led to a need for supplementary ships and manpower in the majority of systems.

As a result, bounty vouchers for known criminals are now worth more in Alliance, Imperial, Federal and independent space. This increase will be honoured by all starport security offices, and other locations that offer Interstellar Factor services.

Bounty hunter groups and private law enforcement agencies are alerting their members to the changes. This message from the notorious Kazimir Clan is typical of the information being distributed:

« Don't be surprised if you scan a wanted ship and it displays the same amount as it did before. Many security services haven't updated their networks with the higher payouts \u2013 probably to make it look like they aren't relying on us to do their dirty work. Once the claim is validated, the appropriate increase is applied and will be visible in your transactions panel. »

As with recent dramatic changes to the pricing of commodities, a period of volatility for bounties is expected as market forces define their true value in these uncertain times. As yet, the value of combat bonds has not been affected.


* Lakon Spaceways Rejects Core Dynamics Bid
A proposal by the Federal corporation Core Dynamics to purchase the construction company Lakon Spaceways has been officially rejected.

Naomi Landseer, chairperson of Lakon's board of directors, made this statement:

« We thank Mr Rochester and his team for their approach. However, I can confirm that Lakon Spaceways will remain an independent company. »

Business reporter Irfan Karim analysed the situation more closely for The Alliance Tribune:

« This decision has surprised many analysts, considering the persistent rumours that Lakon is in far greater difficulty than financial statements would suggest. Although its shipbuilding partnership with the Alliance proved highly lucrative, insiders believe that the firm has overstretched itself in terms of resources and manpower. »

« There have also been public comments from high-profile shareholders in Lakon, who are pressuring the board to accept ownership by Core Dynamics. Some complain of falling dividends, while others accuse Ms Landseer of focusing exclusively on Alliance contracts. »

A spokesperson for Core Dynamics confirmed that the offer to purchase Lakon Spaceways has not yet been withdrawn, and that CEO Jupiter Rochester is looking at all available options.


* Capital Ship Construction Initiatives Conclude
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Parallel campaigns in the Empire and the Federation to provide commodities for building new capital ships have ended.

The Federal Navy's construction programme was boosted by deliveries of building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies. Contributing pilots can now collect their rewards at Schweickart City in the Parutis system.

As a result, 5 newly completed Farragut-class Battle Cruisers will become operational within a matter of days. They are expected to be patrolling in several Federal systems including Atropos, Iman Caber, LHS 142, LFT 367 and Wolf 25.

The Imperial Navy is also rewarding all traders who delivered building fabricators, microbial furnaces and energy grid assemblies for use in its shipyards. Payments can be collected from Miyasaka Orbital in the Mandh system.

It has been confirmed that 4 new Majestic-class Interdictors will shortly join the fleet. Filed flight plans suggest that their shakedown cruises will take place in the Chimechilo, Orannika, Theta Indi and Zelano systems.

As well as capital ships, Federal Congress and the Imperial Senate have both increased funding for other military operations, including support vessels and ground forces.


* Explorers Needed for Coalsack Nebula Project
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Sirius Atmospherics has requested help from independent pilots to provide exploration data focusing on ammonia worlds for terraforming purposes.

The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is working in partnership with the Alliance to establish colonies within the Coalsack Nebula, and to identify sites of commercial and scientific interest.

Dr Maximilian North, Sirius Atmospherics's project director, outlined the requirements:

« We have developed revolutionary new terraforming procedures for terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres. Our collaboration with the Alliance is the perfect opportunity to try and put these to practical use, with the goal of transforming the region into a more human-friendly place. »

« Sirius Atmospherics offers rewards for explorers who can provide us with exploration data. We are particularly interested in detailed scans focusing on the composition of ammonia worlds, not just in the Coalsack Nebula but elsewhere. Gathering wide-ranging data will enable us to determine the most suitable targets for environmental conversion. »

Pilots are requested to deliver exploration data to the Sirius Atmospherics research facility at Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.


* Lakon Spaceways Discounts Selected Ships
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Temporary price reductions have been announced for several Lakon vessels, in an effort to increase short-term profits.

Lakon Spaceways has applied a 30% discount on sales of the following ship types:

Asp Scout

Diamondback Scout

Keelback

Type-7 Transporter

Type-10 Defender

The reduced prices are expected to last until the 30th of December 3306.

Some industry analysts believe this is an attempt to increase short-term payouts for Lakon's shareholders, many of whom have complained about falling dividends. Other investors have publicly pressured the company to accept a takeover bid from the Federal corporation Core Dynamics.

These issues were addressed by Naomi Landseer, chairperson of Lakon's board of directors:

« It is true that profit margins are not as impressive as in previous years, but we can assure all stakeholders and customers that Lakon Spaceways remains financially secure. We project an upswing in military contracts during this turbulent time, and our achievements on behalf of the Alliance position us as one of the galaxy's premiere shipbuilders. »


* Universal Increase to Combat Bond and Anti-Xeno Payouts
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The values of combat bonds and anti-xeno bonds have been increased, as factions focus on bolstering defences.

Financial instability and the current political tensions have led to factions upscaling their rewards for combat bonds, as well as bonds received for destroying Thargoid vessels.

These increases to anti-xeno and combat bonds will be in effect across Alliance, Federal, Imperial and independent space. They can be processed as usual at any starport offering the relevant services.

This follows a turbulent period in many marketplaces that has impacted commodity prices, as well as producing a boost to the value of bounty vouchers.

The changes were remarked upon by Professor Ophelia Kaufmann, head of economics at Orion Independent University:

« As anticipated, the ongoing volatility of financial markets has led to further widespread revaluation. With heightened hostility between the Empire and the Federation, coupled with terrorist attacks and a resurgence in Thargoid activity, it is hardly surprising that every faction now places a greater premium on protecting their citizens. »

« Although some may view the current tranche of changes as inevitable or overdue, there may well be additional revaluing in other fields as a result of competing market forces. The only certainty is of further uncertainty. »


* Marlinist Refugee Crisis Grows Critical
Hundreds of thousands of political refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation have brought both superpowers to the brink of conflict.

The Marlinists, who believe in restructuring the Empire into a republic, escaped crackdowns in several Imperial systems during a hunt for Neo-Marlinist terrorists.

The Federation has provided temporary safe haven for the refugees. However, security concerns proved to be justified when the NMLA bombed a Federal starport where captured members were being held.

The Federal Security Service provided this update:

« The Marlinists themselves have informed us of more individuals among them with NMLA connections. The risk of terrorism from this population is now low, although it's impossible to know exactly how many have been radicalised. »

There have been heated debates in Congress over granting citizenship to the Marlinists. President Hudson insisted that « all illegal aliens must be deported », and has strengthened the Federal Navy as a defensive measure in light of the Empire's warnings.

Conversely, Shadow President Winters argued that « turning away starving refugees to face imprisonment and discrimination would be immoral ». She also noted that the same principles of democratic representation found in Marlinism are enshrined in the Federal Accord.

This disagreement between the Republican and Liberal Parties has led to stalemate, with the fate of the Marlinists hanging in the balance.


* Sirius Corporation Campaign to Establish Marlinist Colonies
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Commodities are requested to create new settlements for Marlinist refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation.

Sirius Corporation has offered to resolve the current standoff between superpowers by establishing colonies where the refugees can live independently.

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, summarised his proposal:

« It is clear that the Marlinists cannot return to the Empire, and are a destabilising presence within the Federation. We offer an alternative by constructing permanent habitats for their population. These will be self-governed and may freely trade with the galactic community. »

« Sirius cannot stand by while the risk of interstellar war increases. I sincerely hope this leads to a more stable and profitable period for us all. »

After intense debate, both Congress and the Senate accepted the proposal, with the proviso that any refugees identified as NMLA members will be returned to the Empire.

Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader, also offered her approval:

« We were forced to abandon our entire lives because of our political beliefs. This at least gives us a chance to have homes again. »

Traders are asked to deliver atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers to Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05 1146 system. From there, the Omega Merchant Command will distribute resources for the colonisation of up to ten uninhabited systems.


* Coalsack Nebula Project Gathers Ammonia Worlds Data
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Explorers have catalogued many ammonia worlds for a Sirius Atmospherics terraforming project in the Coalsack Nebula.

The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is one of several companies that are working in partnership with the Alliance to commercially exploit the region.

Project director Dr Maximilian North announced the successful completion of the initiative:

« The data provided on planets with ammonia-based atmospheres will be invaluable to our terraforming simulations. With our new environmental techniques, some of these poisonous worlds within the nebula may one day become habitable. »

Sirius Atmospherics has confirmed that payouts for all contributing pilots are now available at Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.

As the expansion into the Coalsack Nebula progresses, Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force commented on the possibility of further attacks from the Thargoids:

« Anti-xeno security is not as stringent as we had planned, due to the low availability of ADF vessels and Aegis being impacted by Federal and Imperial defunding. It may be necessary to call upon the galactic community again, should we encounter further interference from the Thargoids. »


* Outpost Planned for 'The Roof of Space'
Multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham is constructing a permanent outpost at the farthest system above the galactic plane.

The orbital outpost will be located within the HIP 58832 system. This is commonly held to be at the galactic zenith, one of the highest locations that can practically be reached.

The project is funded by the corporation Rackham Capital Investments, with the close involvement of Universal Cartographics and several other scientific organisations. The outpost's location will make it ideal for gathering astronomical data on the overall structure of the galactic spiral.

This historic scientific endeavour was remarked upon by Mr Rackham from his private villa complex on the Rhea Archipelago:

« Back in my days of plying the trade routes in a second-hand Sidewinder, the idea of standing on the roof of space was an idle daydream. This new generation of pilots and ships will make my vision a reality. »

« No doubt many important scientific observations will be made once the outpost is up and running, but more importantly, there'll be a bar \u2013 and the drinks are on me! »

A spokesperson for Rackham Capital Investments later confirmed that the outpost in the HIP 58832 system would be operational on the 17th of December 3306, but clarified that there was no legal guarantee for beverage reimbursement.


* Core Dynamics Funds Takeover with Ship Discounts
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Prices for several Core Dynamics vessels have been temporarily reduced, as part of an attempt to purchase Lakon Spaceways.

The shipbuilding corporation has applied a 30% discount to sales of the Eagle Mk II and the Vulture. There is also a 20% discount on sales of Federal Assault Ships, Federal Dropships and Federal Gunships, although the Federal Navy rank requirements for each vessel continue to apply.

The reduced prices are expected to last until the 30th of December 3306.

Core Dynamics recently made a proposal to acquire rival company Lakon Spaceways, which rejected the offer then applied markdowns to its own ships to increase short-term profits.

The Alliance Tribune's business reporter Irfan Karim speculated on these developments:

« CEO Jupiter Rochester remains tight-lipped on the reasons for these discounts, but it seems likely that he is raising funds for a more aggressive bid. Rumours are circulating of Lakon investors being bribed to sell their shares, or coerced into demanding that the board of directors accepts ownership by Core Dynamics. »

« Many industry analysts are convinced that a hostile takeover of Lakon Spaceways is underway. If successful, we could see vessels that are commonly associated with the Alliance \u2013 such as the Chieftain and Type-10 Defender \u2013 manufactured by a Federal corporation in the future. »


* Rackham's Peak Outpost Marks Galactic Zenith
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham's new orbital outpost at the galactic zenith is now operational.

Rackham's Peak is situated in the HIP 58832 system, one of the highest practical locations above the galactic plane. Its construction was funded by Rackham Capital Investments, in conjunction with Universal Cartographics and other scientific research companies.

Traders have been welcomed, although the increased distances between stars at the galaxy's fringes mean that vessels with a high jump range are recommended. Rackham's Peak is currently offering high prices for deliveries of beer, liquor, wine, Bast Snake Gin, Centauri Mega Gin, Chateau De Aegaeon, Eranin Pearl Whisky, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Harma Silver Sea Rum, Indi Bourbon, Kongga Ale, Lavian Brandy, Leestian Evil Juice, Saxon Wine, Thrutis Cream and Wuthielo Ku Froth.

Mr Rackham officiated at the outpost's opening ceremony, which was followed by an extravagant press party for media representatives and attending celebrities. He gave this statement:

« The top of the galaxy is now open for business! Rackham's Peak is a free port where everyone is welcome, a place where explorers and entrepreneurs can enjoy drinks while overlooking the entire Milky Way. Aim high, Commanders! »

In related news, Rackham Capital Investments has agreed to pay a repairs bill from Universal Cartographics for the outpost's sensor array control systems, which suffered fluid-related damage during the party.


* Commodities Delivered to Build Marlinist Colonies
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has successfully gathered materials to construct new independent settlements for Marlinist emigrants.

Both the Empire and the Federation accepted the proposal from Sirius Corporation to establish colonies for the political refugees, who have been the cause of increased tension between the superpowers.

CEO Li Yong-Rui made this announcement:

« As always, the galactic community's immense contribution has made this achievement possible. The shipments of atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers will be used to construct new outposts and settlements in 8 uninhabited systems. »

The Omega Merchant Command is now offering rewards at Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05 1146 system to all pilots who delivered commodities.

Aaron Whyte, a community leader among the refugees, commented on Vox Galactica:

« I suppose we should be grateful that these colonies give us a chance of survival. But none of us wanted to set up our own kingdoms \u2013 only to remove the kings. And one day, we will. »

The Marlinist population is expected to be transferred from Federal space to the new colonies in early 3307.


* Engineers Boost Ship Module Upgrading
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The effectiveness of engineers' upgrading for ship modules will be boosted until the 7th of January 3307.

During this time, engineered weapons and modules will receive increased augmentation for the same amount of materials. This will apply to every workshop in Alliance, Imperial, Federal and independent space.

Lori Jameson, an engineer based in the Shinrarta Dezhra system, provided details to Vox Galactica on how this collaboration came about:

« After the Eurybia incident, some of us contacted Liz Ryder and offered our support. It was horrifying how her expertise had been abused by the NMLA, leaving her unfairly maligned as a terrorist supporter. There were concerns that her situation might reflect badly on engineers in general. »

« We soon established communication links between every workshop, and agreed to offer a universal boost to upgrades. Hopefully this will remind pilots how much we value their custom, and that we remain a trustworthy resource. »

Mel Brandon, one of four engineers in the Colonia Region, commented:

« It's about time that we all started talking to each other. Our services are valuable to the whole galaxy. We deserve better protection. Maybe we have to start protecting ourselves. »


* Terrorism Respite as Marlinists Prepare for New Homes
As independent colonies are set up for Marlinist refugees, there has been a lull in terrorist strikes from the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA).

In recent months, the paramilitary group launched multiple attacks across the Empire. Starports and administrative buildings were bombed and dozens of individuals assassinated, including Prince Harold and more distant members of the Duval family.

However, the number of incidents has fallen drastically following successful operations by the Imperial Internal Security Service:

« After the Federal Security Service identified NMLA members aboard the emigrants' megaships, these were transferred to us for interrogation. We obtained information that enabled us to shut down many terrorist cells, although there is evidence that the NMLA's network remains widespread. »

In related news, hundreds of thousands of Marlinist refugees are preparing to occupy new colony systems established by the Sirius Corporation. Mass transportation will take place early next year, overseen by Safeguard Interstellar. The Empire, Federation and Sirius Gov have all agreed that the settlements will remain fully independent.

The refugee population has already begun to determine its future social structure, based on the principles of Marlinism. A transitional parliament has been formed by community leaders such as Dr Jenna Fairfax, Aaron Whyte and Amrita Ross. Democratic elections for a representative government will take place once the Marlinist Colonies are operational.


* Investors Take Control of Lakon Spaceways
A coalition of Lakon Spaceways shareholders has voted to replace several members of the company's board of directors with new management.

At an emergency general meeting, investors put forward a resolution to remove selected directors, in accordance with Lakon's articles of association. The majority vote was in favour of this resolution.

New appointees to the board have already stated that the rejected bid by Federal shipbuilder Core Dynamics will be reappraised. Jupiter Rochester, the corporation's CEO, has welcomed the opportunity for fresh discussions.

Chairperson Naomi Landseer, who is one of the directors being replaced, told Vox Galactica:

« It's no coincidence that the board members being voted out are the same ones who were against Core Dynamics owning the company. I am convinced that Rochester's people are bribing or threatening our shareholders to make sure this hostile takeover goes through. »

Lakon Spaceways is currently offering a 30% discount on sales of Asp Scouts, Diamondback Scouts, Keelbacks, Type-7 Transporters and Type-10 Defenders.

Core Dynamics has applied a 30% markdown to sales of the Eagle MkII and the Vulture, with a 20% discount for Federal Assault Ships, Federal Dropships and Federal Gunships.


* Alliance Shelters New Marlinist Refugees
Tens of thousands of Marlinist refugees have claimed sanctuary in Alliance space, after emigrating from the Empire to avoid political persecution.

In recent weeks, there has been a steady stream of ex-Imperial citizens arriving at Alliance systems, mostly travelling aboard small private vessels or in the holds of cargo ships.

The humanitarian aid organisation Safeguard Interstellar reported that accommodation and basic necessities are being provided. Alliance Interpol is running stringent security checks for evidence that members of the NMLA terrorist group are present.

The initial wave of refugees, which fled to the Federation, are currently preparing to populate a number of independent colonies established by the Sirius Corporation. However, these systems cannot yet provide harbour to the continuing exodus of Marlinists from the Empire.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon publicly welcomed the refugees, but there has been some dissent in the Alliance Assembly. Councillor Nakato Kaine, who is expected to be Mahon's main rival in next year's election, received widespread support for her views:

« Naturally, we must provide these poor people with emergency aid, but there are practical limits to our resources. It is not our responsibility to solve the Empire's domestic issues, and we have seen the Federation pay the price for sheltering terrorists. The Alliance cannot end up as the dumping ground for other superpowers' problems. »


* Coalsack Nebula Terraforming Project Stalls
Sirius Atmospherics has delivered an update on its experiments to terraform ammonia worlds in the Coalsack Nebula.

The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is working closely with the Alliance to exploit the nebula's resources and pursue scientific investigation, including terraforming terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres.

Project director Dr Maximilian North gave this progress report:

« Preliminary efforts at ecosphere conversion have delivered promising results, but our new techniques are not as effective as the simulations based on exploration data suggested. We are still a long way from fully transforming these worlds into habitable environments. »

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse commented on this via the Rewired network:

« Does anyone really believe Sirius is there for the terraforming? Of course they can't magically turn ammonia hellholes into paradise planets overnight! I know a cover story when I smell one. I wouldn't be surprised if they're deliberately trying to provoke the Thargoids for some reason, maybe to capture some specimens. Where there's xenos, there's credits. »

The Alliance has corroborated Dr North's report, but also confirmed an increase in Sirius Corporation personnel and equipment arriving in the Coalsack Nebula.


* Lakon Spaceways Faces Financial Collapse
Economic instability has caused the value of shares in Lakon Spaceways to drop to unprecedented lows, placing the company's future in doubt.

A hostile takeover bid by Federal corporation Core Dynamics has raised concerns in the Alliance over the loss of a major defence contractor. The Independent Commission for Market Equality has also reported irregularities in the recent transfer of share ownership, which may lead to criminal investigations.

As a result, although Lakon Spaceways continues to manufacture and sell ships, its lack of reserves and a loss of confidence among investors may lead to insolvency and dissolution.

Trent Delaney, the newly appointed chairperson of Lakon's board of directors, announced:

« Financial mismanagement and a litany of poor business decisions have led to this situation. Rest assured that once formal negotiations with our new parent company are complete, Lakon's stock will rise to new heights. »

According to Federal business analysts, there are indications of displeasure among Core Dynamics senior directors regarding this takeover. An anonymous source from within the corporation told Vox Galactica:

« The Lakon merger is entirely Jupiter Rochester's project. Frankly, it's sheer greed. Our income has soared recently with new commissions from the Navy, but Rochester's grabbing hands are always reaching for something. He runs the departments that are loyal to him like they're his personal kingdom. »


* Thargoids Attack Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Large numbers of Thargoid vessels are swarming through multiple inhabited systems, leading to urgent calls for assistance.

In what appears to be a coordinated strike, Thargoid scouts and interceptors have appeared throughout the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas. Local security ships have engaged them in combat, but report being overwhelmed.

The Alliance has a considerable presence in these regions, with four starports recently constructed in the Coalsack Nebula. But the Alliance Defence Force has not been able to mobilise in time to prevent some systems from becoming infested with Thargoids.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, made this announcement:

« This is a resurgence of Thargoid activity on a scale that we have not witnessed for a long time. Unfortunately, drastic reductions in funding and resources mean that Aegis is unable to provide adequate defensive measures. »

« We urgently request support from independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. It is critical that we prevent the Thargoids from dominating these nebulas and wiping out many thousands of people. »


* Utopia Invites Superpowers to Galactic Summit
Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of the Utopia commune, has proposed hosting a diplomatic conference for the governments of all three superpowers.

The intention is to provide a neutral location to discuss key issues such as the renewed Thargoid attacks, the Marlinist refugee crisis, and hostilities between the Empire and the Federation.

Details have been sent to the Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate. Pranav Antal has also broadcast his invitation across all media channels:

« It is not Utopia's tradition to become involved with politics, but recent events are of great concern to us all. Interstellar war, terrorism, alien incursion and economic collapse are the new four dark horsemen that threaten humanity's future. »

« We therefore offer to host a Galactic Summit where the Alliance, Empire and Federation may debate these problems peacefully. My sincere hope is that the heads of state grasp this opportunity to resolve their differences and create solutions that benefit their peoples. »

Utopia is an independent society with a focus on using highly advanced technology to increase quality of life. Should this Galactic Summit take place, it would be the first diplomatic meeting of all three superpower governments.


* Countdown to Alliance Election Begins
The Alliance has entered a period of political campaigning prior to the election of a new prime minister.

The appointment of a head of government takes place every six years, with the forthcoming vote scheduled for the 25th of February 3307.

Unlike the Federation, there are no political parties in the Alliance. The Assembly is comprised of councillors who each represent the ruling faction of a member system. Electoral votes will be cast by these individuals rather than the public, but councillors tend to abide by the majority views of their constituencies.

Edmund Mahon is the current prime minister, having been in office since 3301, and is campaigning for re-election. If successful, he will be the first to serve more than one term.

There are several rivals challenging Mahon, but the greatest support is for Councillor Nakato Kaine of Tionisla. She has become a rallying point for discontent among the Assembly, speaking out against the Alliance's increasing dependence upon corporations and other superpowers.

At an emergency debate regarding the current wave of Thargoid attacks, Councillor Kaine stated:

« Can we be surprised that the Thargoid race is launching fresh assaults against us, when we brazenly invade their territories? Our obsession with meta-alloys has turned us into the aggressor! This is not the same Alliance that I pledged to serve. It's time for a new direction. »


* Core Dynamics Purchases Lakon Spaceways
The shipbuilding company Lakon Spaceways has officially accepted a bid for ownership from Federal corporation Core Dynamics.

The proposal from Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester was ratified following a majority vote by Lakon's board of directors, many of whom were recently appointed following resignations demanded by shareholders.

Trent Delaney, the new chairperson, confirmed the merger in a public statement:

« We are overjoyed that Lakon Spaceways will join the Core Dynamics family, thereby overturning the mistakes of the previous management and setting us on course for a bright future. »

« The transfer of ownership will take another two months to formalise. In that time, it will be business as usual for the manufacture and sale of our ships. »

The Federal Commerce Authority has approved the corporate takeover. However, the Independent Commission for Market Equality is still investigating reports of irregularities.

The Council of Admirals has expressed concerns that a military supplier for the Alliance Defence Force should be owned by a Federal defence contractor. Admiral Rachel Ziegler informed the Assembly:

« Regardless of our cordial relationship with the Federation, security issues will inevitably arise if the Alliance Chieftain and her sister ships are constructed by a foreign power. The ADF is already woefully underfunded, and this places extra strain on our ability to defend our interests. »


* Xenological Samples Required by Colonia Scientists
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Holloway Bioscience Institute in Colonia is offering high payouts for delivering samples from space-dwelling lifeforms.

The Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G is the organisation's primary research laboratory, which specialises in xenological studies. Jaques Station, which is also in the Colonia system, has agreed to serve as the delivery point for this initiative.

Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir outlined the requirements:

« There is still a huge amount to learn about the fascinating structures that grow within the vacuum of space. As our stock of specimens is running low, we require fresh tissue samples from living organisms to continue our experimentation programme. »

« I appreciate that our facility is located a considerable distance from the core systems, but we're willing to offer generous reimbursement for those who make the journey. »

Pilots are requested to extract any type of tissue sample, including pod mesoglea, from any type of seed pod. These are to be delivered to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.


* Thargoids Wreak Havoc in Nebulas
Starports in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas have been damaged during full-scale Thargoid incursions.

An appeal by Aegis for anti-xeno support led to a concerted response from the galactic community. However, the Thargoid forces proved to be overwhelming and have attacked systems within the nebulas, with the loss of thousands of lives.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison of Aegis, broadcast this message:

« Despite the heroic efforts of many pilots, the alien ships have resisted being driven from the Witch Head Nebula. »

« Aegis's military capability and manpower are both severely limited as a result of curtailed funding from the Empire and the Federation. We have no choice but to rely on independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons as the first line of defence against the Thargoid threat. »


* Aegis Supports Galactic Summit
The organisation Aegis has expressed support for Utopia's offer to host a Galactic Summit for all three superpowers.

Aegis was jointly formed by the Alliance, Empire and Federation to study the Thargoids, and develop new methods of monitoring and combating their forces.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, gave this statement:

« Humanity's focus on petty internal conflicts has blinded us to the existential threat of the Thargoids. Their recent horrific attacks should be a wake-up call to the fact that defunding has crippled Aegis's ability to offer protection. »

« We strongly entreat our founders to come together and channel resources toward Aegis, and particularly into research. There can be no hope of coexistence with this alien species unless we increase our understanding of them. »

No official responses to Utopia's proposal have been made as yet. However, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Princess Aisling Duval and Shadow President Felicia Winters have all signalled broad approval of the idea. There are reports that many congressmen, councillors and senators are pressuring their respective leaders to attend the diplomatic conference.

Simguru Pranav Antal has confirmed that the governments of independent systems will also be welcome to send delegates to the Galactic Summit. However, Utopia's primary aim is to provide neutral territory for the Alliance, Empire and Federation to debate policies.


* Date Set for Trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent
Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent of the Federal Navy will stand trial on the 25th of January, charged with conspiracy to commit murder and treason.

The Federal Attorney's Office has successfully obtained a grand jury indictment against Fleet Admiral Vincent. He is accused of arranging the sabotage of presidential vessel Starship One in 3301, to assassinate then-President Jasmina Halsey. Although she was later recovered alive, hundreds died when the ship was destroyed in flight.

These charges were brought following the trial of Rory Webster, a naval technician who was implicated in the failure of Starship One's hyperdrive system. Mr Webster confessed his involvement, but offered a plea bargain by providing evidence that he was following clandestine orders from Vincent.

The subsequent arrest caused repercussions in military and political circles. President Zachary Hudson's long-term association with Vincent resulted in Republican congressmen losing confidence in his leadership, and increased the Liberal Party's popularity.

As a naval chief of staff, Fleet Admiral Vincent is the highest ranking Federal military officer to ever stand trial. Media interest remains intense, with much public speculation about corruption among the Federation's highest echelons.

The trial will take place at the Federal High Court in Olympus Village on Mars, and is expected to last several weeks.


* Core Dynamics Insider Discusses Lakon Takeover
An anonymous source within the shipbuilding corporation Core Dynamics has revealed details behind its hostile takeover of Lakon Spaceways.

The nameless insider had previously stated that the acquisition of Lakon was the personal project of Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester. These additional claims were broadcast via Vox Galactica:

« In the last few years, Rochester has purchased many companies based outside the Federation, such as Vodel. Lakon Spaceways is just the latest. It seems legal, but he manages these subsidiaries directly and installs his own people there. Some say he's diversifying his family's private holdings, rather than expanding the business. »

« It's well known that several departments only follow Rochester's directives, and operate in silos unconnected with the rest of Core Dynamics. Staff refer to them as 'Jupiter Division'. Some offices even started using that name, like they're a separate company within a company. »

« I've heard that some directors are unhappy with Rochester, but he's too well-connected to ever get rid of. It's thanks to him that we have so many military contracts. As always, the rich get away with anything. »

Core Dynamics declined to comment on this statement. Naomi Landseer, former chairperson of the Lakon Spaceways board of directors, has asked the Independent Commission for Market Equality to investigate further.


* New Marlinist Systems Request Emergency Food Supplies
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The newly settled Marlinist Colonies have asked for urgent deliveries of foodstuffs.

Millions of Marlinists have relocated to eight systems colonised for them by the Sirius Corporation, thereby reducing tension between the Empire and the Federation. They have asked Universal Cartographics to delay a census of the systems' populations, while the refugees lay the infrastructure for their new societies.

The Marlinist factions are holding democratic elections to select their leaders. However, the transitional parliament has declared an emergency due to the shortage of food stocks.

Community spokesperson Dr Jenna Fairfax announced:

« We are grateful to the galactic community and Sirius Corporation for providing homes. However, we need further help to feed our people in the short term, until we can become self-sufficient. »

« The more supplies we can stockpile, the faster our economies will develop. This in turn will allow us to offer greater commodity discounts, to encourage the establishment of regular trade routes. »

Pilots are asked to deliver animal meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and grain to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.

As this system's defence forces are still being formed, the Free Marlinists of Carinae have offered bounties on all wanted ships to secure these initial trade runs to the Marlinist Colonies.


* Xenological Samples Delivered to Colonia
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Holloway Bioscience Institute has rewarded pilots who delivered living matter extracted from space-dwelling organisms.

Many shipments of seed pod tissue samples arrived at Jaques Station, from where they will be transported to the Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G. These will be used to replenish stocks used in the facility's experimentation programme.

Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude:

« These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway we're making many breakthroughs in the field of xenobiology, some with intriguing commercial possibilities. »

The Holloway Bioscience Institute now plans to establish experimental habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:

Eol Prou PC-K c9-221

Eol Prou LW-L c8-99

Eol Prou KW-L c8-301

Eol Prou PC-K c9-154

Pilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Jacques Station in the Colonia system.


* Uncertainty Hits Takeover of Lakon Spaceways
The purchase of shipbuilding company Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics is in doubt after allegations of illegal business practices.

Irfan Karim reported on the recent developments for The Alliance Tribune:

« The Independent Commission for Market Equality has confirmed that several Lakon shareholders sold their stock to shell companies, which were covertly established by departments within Core Dynamics. Furthermore, two serious accusations of blackmail have been referred to Alliance Interpol. »

« Trent Delaney, Lakon's newly installed chairperson, has dismissed these claims. But coupled with serious rumblings from the Council of Admirals over losing a military supplier, this hostile takeover now looks less certain. »

In the Federation, the newsfeed Sol Today ran an editorial piece on the situation:

« Acquiring Lakon is another bold triumph for manufacturing colossus Core Dynamics. It's a shame that it's being undermined by the petty bureaucrats of the Alliance, who should be gratefully grasping this financial lifeline. »

« It's also laughable that CEO Jupiter Rochester, one of our titans of industry, is being stabbed in the back by old-fashioned colleagues who are clearly jealous of his success. Perhaps his 'Jupiter Division' has finally outgrown the corporation and deserves to forge its own path. »


* Galactic Summit Proposal from Sirius Corporation
Utopia's ability to host a diplomatic conference for all three superpowers has been challenged by the Sirius Corporation.

The megacorp's counter-proposal was announced by CEO Li Yong-Rui:

« With all due respect to Simguru Antal, his commune cannot match our level of resources. Sirius is far better placed in terms of logistics and security, and our navy will be able to ensure the safe transportation of all delegates. »

« Furthermore, we already have excellent commercial relationships with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, and can therefore guarantee neutrality. Our recent philanthropic gesture at creating the Marlinist Colonies proves that we are an impartial, stabilising force for the whole galaxy. »

Discussions regarding the conference have been ongoing in superpower and independent systems alike. Some leaders have decried it as a pointless exercise, while others view it as a rare opportunity for political cohesion.

Sirius Corporation and Utopia's propositions for a Galactic Summit are now being compared by potential attendees. However, Zachary Rackham's offer to host the conference at the actual galactic summit of Rackham's Peak is not being seriously considered.


* Prime Minister Mahon Campaigns for Re-Election
Edmund Mahon has launched a political campaign to be elected as the Alliance's leader for a second term.

The incumbent prime minister is undertaking a whistle-stop tour across Alliance space to rouse support. Only members of the Assembly can cast votes in this election, but they will be heavily influenced by public opinion within their systems.

Mahon's campaign has focused on the Alliance's huge expansion during his six-year premiership, with reminders of triumphs such as the Alliance Festival of Culture. His ability to handle a crisis has also been highlighted, including President Kincaid's attempted coup and the League of Reparation's crusade.

More recent examples of his leadership are welcoming Marlinist refugees from the Empire and exploiting the Coalsack Nebula to boost economic prosperity. However, Mahon's critics have pointed out that both strategies increased the risk of attack from Neo-Marlinist terrorists and the Thargoids.

Addressing a packed conference hall on Birmingham in his home system of Diso, Mahon proclaimed:

« We live in an increasingly turbulent galaxy, making it important to maintain a steady hand at the wheel. I will be honoured to continue representing the diverse peoples of the Alliance. »


* Jasmina Halsey Returns to the Federation
Former President Jasmina Halsey has arrived on Mars to stand as a witness in the upcoming trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent.

Halsey was subpoenaed by the Federal High Court to testify before the jury. Although this was not legally enforceable, since she now lives beyond the Federation's jurisdiction, she has acceded to the court's request.

Jasmina Halsey served as Federal president prior to the destruction of Starship One in 3301, which Vincent is accused of arranging. She was recovered alive, but abandoned her political career and emigrated to the Alliance. She has since campaigned as a peace activist and acted as an adviser to Prime Minister Edmund Mahon.

After greeting a large crowd of supporters at Olympus Village Spaceport, Halsey gave a statement to The Federal Times:

« This is a bittersweet moment for me. Coming back to the Federation feels like revisiting a past life. But perhaps we can finally lay some ghosts to rest. »

She was welcomed in person by Shadow President Felicia Winters, who was secretary of state in Halsey's administration. However, President Zachary Hudson has made no comment regarding his predecessor's return or the forthcoming trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent.


* Marlinist Colonies Receive Emergency Food Supplies
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Large amounts of food commodities have been delivered to the Marlinist Colonies.

Multiple shipments of animal meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and grain were transported to Stillman Hub. Messages of gratitude were broadcast from all the Marlinist factions, which have distributed these vital supplies across the eight colony systems.

The Free Marlinists of Carinae also issued bounty vouchers for wanted ships, in order to protect the deliveries. Contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.

In related news, the first Marlinist Parliament has been democratically elected. The respected community leader Dr Jenna Fairfax was chosen by a majority public vote to be First Minister. In a public address, she said:

« This path was not chosen by us, but our people have turned Marlin Duval's ideology into a functioning republican society. Now that we are fully independent members of the galactic community, we can repay those who aided our survival by offering discounts on commodities and establishing regular trading. »


* Sirius and Utopia Compete to Host Galactic Summit
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Rival initiatives to arrange a diplomatic conference have been launched by Sirius Corporation and the Utopia commune.

The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have each provisionally agreed to send delegates to the first tri-superpower Galactic Summit in late February. This political gathering will also be attended by representatives from independent systems.

All parties have specified that their participation depends upon the event being successfully organised in neutral territory, and with sufficient resources and security in place.

Sirius Corporation and Utopia have begun to gather supplies to host the conference. Both have requested assistance from the galactic community to provide a broad range of data, which will be vital for planning security operations. Whichever organisation obtains the greatest amount of data will be deemed most suitable.

The following data sources are of interest to both parties: anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files.

Simguru Pranav Antal has called upon all pilots who support Utopia's proposal to deliver the data to Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system.

CEO Li Yong-Rui has asked all those who believe Sirius Corporation to be a more suitable host to deliver the data to Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.


* Councillor Kaine Campaigns for Alliance Votes
Councillor Nakato Kaine is visiting key systems across the Alliance as part of her bid to be elected as the next prime minister.

Of all the challengers to the incumbent Edmund Mahon, Kaine has the most support from fellow council members. She has represented the Tionisla system for nearly a decade, and is renowned for delivering forceful speeches before the Assembly.

Kaine's disapproval of the expansionist policies in recent years has struck a chord with people in many systems. She also has a strong reputation among the 'Old Worlds', which are viewed as the historic hub of the Alliance.

During a political rally on Leesti, Councillor Kaine directly criticised her election opponent:

« Prime Minister Mahon clearly thinks that the Alliance must mimic the Empire's arrogance and the Federation's corporate greed. He has repeatedly led us into conflict with the Thargoid race, risking millions of lives so we could raid their territories like thieves in the night. »

« I believe that we should be inspired by the mutual cooperation that once made the Old Worlds thrive. We must invest in trade and security to benefit our member systems, instead of pretending to be a monolithic superpower. »


* Trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent Begins
The Federal High Court on Mars has opened the trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent, who is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and treason.

Vincent stands accused of organising the sabotage of Starship One in 3301, resulting in hundreds of deaths.

The Federal Times's crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported:

« The trial began with the prosecution counsel outlining the case. Material evidence obtained from Chief Technician Rory Webster, whose testimony led to Vincent's arrest, was presented before the jury. »

« Vincent was questioned about a secure transmission from his office to the presidential vessel on the 24th of May 3301, ordering an unscheduled diversion to the Azaleach system for routine maintenance. This is where Webster's engineering team followed Vincent's orders to install the sabotaged hyperdrive component that caused the misjump. »

« Evading the questions, Vincent claimed that the entire trial was a 'Liberal Party cover-up' and that Starship One was destroyed 'to put Winters in charge'. »

« With the loss of President Halsey and Vice President Naylor, Felicia Winters did indeed assume the role of acting president and became leader of the Liberal Party. However, the defence counsel played down these accusations, instead declaring that Webster's recordings of Vincent's orders could have been falsified. »


* Jasmina Halsey Provides Testimony about Starship One
Former President Jasmina Halsey has taken the witness stand during the trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent at the Federal High Court.

Crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported the details for The Federal Times:

« Jasmina Halsey confirmed that the orders for Starship One's unscheduled stopover in the Azaleach system came directly from Fleet Admiral Vincent. She added that the presidential itinerary was often altered for various mundane reasons, and at the time this seemed routine. »

« Halsey also provided an account of the vessel's destruction, describing the chaos and panic onboard as the hyperspace misjump caused rapid structural disintegration. She praised her security detail for getting her into a cryogenic stasis pod and launching it moments before Starship One exploded. »

« During cross-examination, the defence counsel quoted her reported visions after being rescued, when Halsey described meeting the 'caretakers of our galaxy' and experiencing the 'infinities of the cosmos'. It was suggested that the testimony of someone suffering from such obvious delusions should be discounted. »

« Halsey admitted that she no longer has any memory of making those statements, and may have been suffering from post-traumatic shock. She then provided the court with psychological reports and neural scans from the Alliance's finest doctors, medically confirming that she is of sound state of mind. »


* Anonymous Source Refers to Distress Call Location
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An encrypted message seems to provide planetary coordinates related to the mysterious signal from 'Serene Harbour'.

The message received by the Pilots Federation was as follows:

Welcome to Serene Harbour. 56.4 latitude -8.3 longitude. Theta Seven.

Although this pinpoints a geographical area on a planetary surface, the astronomical location of this body remains a mystery. It is unclear whether 'Theta Seven' refers to additional map coordinates of some kind, or is a code-phrase intended for unknown recipients.

Little is known about the original distress call, other than its brief content:

This is an emergency broadcast on all frequencies from Serene Harbour. We are \u2013


* Request for Pilots to Trace Distress Call
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An independent vessel has detected a fragment of a mysterious message coming from an unexplored region of space.

Commander Elsa Solomon was travelling through the Swoilz XX-D c1-30 system when her ship's communications array picked up a faint transmission. The message was as follows:

This is an emergency broadcast on all frequencies from Serene Harbour. We are \u2013

The transmission ended abruptly and did not resume. The signal did not contain any identification data or indications as to its origin.

Commander Solomon gave more details to Vox Galactica:

« The message appeared in my comms panels as text and an electronically generated voice. I wasn't able to determine a source, only that it was broadcast within 80 light years of that system. My schedule was tight so I couldn't spend long tracking it. »

« I have no idea if Serene Harbour is a starport, a settlement or even a megaship, but this is obviously a mayday signal. Someone somewhere is in serious trouble. I've asked the Pilots Federation to share the information in case any of my fellow Commanders can help. »

To help triangulate the source, there is a callout to any other ships that were in the area at the time, which may have received a similar broadcast. However, no responses have been received as yet.


* Sirius Corporation Secures Hosting of Galactic Summit
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has received more data than Utopia and will therefore host the Galactic Summit.

Both organisations proposed to organise a diplomatic conference for the Alliance, Empire and Federation. After calling on the galactic community to gather data that would support security operations, many pilots handed in anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files.

All three superpower governments confirmed that due to its success in preparing effective security systems, they will accept Sirius Corporation as the neutral territory for the conference.

CEO Li Yong-Rui made this announcement:

« Thank you to all the independent pilots who supported us. Sirius will now begin work preparing for the first Galactic Summit, which we hope will increase peace and prosperity across the galaxy. »

Pilots who delivered to Sirius Corporation can collect their rewards from Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.

Simguru Pranav Antal expressed disappointment, but confirmed that all who contributed to Utopia's initiative will be rewarded at Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system.

Sirius Corporation has stated that the Galactic Summit is provisionally scheduled to take place over a three-week period in late February and early March.


* Halsey Suggests Motivation for Assassination Attempt
At the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, former President Jasmina Halsey has revealed possible reasons behind the sabotage of Starship One in 3301.

Crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported from the Federal High Court:

« Jasmina Halsey provided details of a top-level Federal Cabinet meeting in late April 3301, an event which was never declassified. Its aim was to address the high levels of public dissatisfaction with her administration. »

« At the meeting, Halsey explained that she had been inspired by various peace activists to refocus on the wellbeing of citizens. She planned to reduce taxes, invest in social infrastructure and slash Federal Navy spending. As yet this was only a preliminary plan, to be implemented later that year. »

« Halsey told the court that only a dozen officials were present at this meeting, including Fleet Admiral Vincent. All were told that this forthcoming sea change in policy was confidential, but to expect major budget changes in the coming months. »

« The prosecution counsel stated that Vincent was therefore aware that naval defunding was imminent, something which would reduce his personal influence. It would also impact powerful individuals who Vincent was illegally connected to, evidence of which would be presented in due course. »


* Alliance Election Delayed due to Galactic Summit
The Alliance Assembly has agreed to delay electing a new prime minister to avoid clashing with the forthcoming Galactic Summit.

The proposal to postpone the election date came from Prime Minister Edmund Mahon:

« Now that the diplomatic conference has been confirmed, we must adapt to take advantage of this historic event. A potential change in leadership occurring at the same time as the Galactic Summit would cause confusion and undermine the Alliance's presence. »

Although Mahon's proposal was voted through by a narrow margin, many council members disagreed with altering the political calendar. Councillor Nakato Kaine, who is a candidate in the election, declared:

« It is outrageous that the prime minister is using this as an excuse to extend his term in office. Once again, he is more concerned with projecting the Alliance as a superpower than the interests of member systems. This behaviour is what you'd expect from a corrupt emperor or president, clinging onto power at any cost. »

The Assembly has rescheduled the election to take place three months later in May 3307, although this remains only provisional.


* Core Dynamics Implicated in Starship One Sabotage
Evidence presented at the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent suggested financial links to Federal shipbuilding corporation Core Dynamics.

This significant development was covered by Ethan Takahashi for The Federal Times:

« The initial investigations around Starship One's destruction in 3301 were outlined by the prosecution. When the Federal Attorney's Office revisited this historical data, traces were found of financial transfers routed through non-Federation banking systems. »

« The FAO brought in the expertise of the Wallglass Investigations Agency, which discovered that these transactions were made via shell companies created by Core Dynamics. Fleet Admiral Vincent, as well as several other naval officers, received billions of credits through these companies that went undeclared. »

« Vincent refused to answer any questions about this evidence, once again claiming that he is the victim of a conspiracy to hand the presidency to Felicia Winters. »

Despite multiple requests from the press, Core Dynamics has not made any public comment. There are unverified reports of large-scale activity taking place at some of the corporation's centres of operation.


* Empire Denies Existence of Secret Prison
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An Imperial Intelligence detention facility discovered in the R CRA Sector AF-A d42 system has been repudiated by the Empire.

The outpost, named Serene Harbour, was located after its distress call was shared publicly by the Pilots Federation. According to the Commander Andee-X- who first investigated the site, all its occupants were dead as the result of what appeared to be a prisoner breakout.

Unlike the Imperial Internal Security Service, the Imperial Intelligence organisation has no spokespeople or public channels. However, Senator Karl Nerva told the media:

« The claim that high-security prisoners and terrorists are being tortured for information in an unregistered outpost is categorically false. There is no such place as 'Serene Harbour'. »

« We believe that independent pilots have been duped by a Federal ploy to undermine the Empire, using fake locations and logs for theatrical effect. I assure all citizens that Imperial Intelligence operates fully within the law and remains vigilant against all threats. »

When asked about Commandant Gabriel De Luca, who was identified by surviving logs at the outpost, Senator Nerva replied:

« Captain De Luca was indeed an agent of Imperial Intelligence, but died on active duty several years ago. It's obvious that this respected hero's identity has been stolen to add credibility to anti-Imperial disinformation. »


* Engineer's Enhanced Missile Rack Initiative
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The engineer Liz Ryder has requested mined materials to help make a previously unique ship module widely available.

The module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was offered in October 3306 to pilots who helped defend the Eurybia system from Imperial forces. At the time, the Empire suspected Liz Ryder of supplying weapons to the NMLA terrorist group.

Ms Ryder has announced that her aim is to make this specially modified weapon available for purchase at all human technology brokers. She added:

« Pilots can help kick-start this project by providing mined commodities, which will temporarily reduce the amount of materials that customers require to obtain the missile rack. As a bonus, the highest contributors to this initiative will be gifted with the module. »

« I'm pleased to be working with tech brokers to add this to the market. Many engineers think we could do more to serve the galactic community, and this is a step in that direction. »

Shipments of bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium can be delivered to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.


* Jupiter Rochester Named in Starship One Trial
Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester has been accused of collaborating with Fleet Admiral Vincent to orchestrate Starship One's destruction in 3301.

As reported by Ethan Takahashi for The Federal Times:

« Financial data was presented to the court showing that Vincent, along with others in government and the Federal Navy, received colossal payments via shell companies created by Jupiter Rochester's loyalists. »

« The prosecution claimed that Rochester and Vincent were reacting to then-President Jasmina Halsey's intention to scale back military spending, which would impact Core Dynamics's profits. They arranged to assassinate her and lay groundwork for Zachary Hudson to be voted into power, knowing that his policies would result in further naval contracts. »

« The defence argued that Halsey's testimony was unreliable, and that the financial data was obtained via improper methods so should have been inadmissible. It was also pointed out that the Rochester family had many enemies determined to besmirch their reputation. »

« The jury has now been sequestered to determine a verdict. This means they are unaware of media reports that several Core Dynamics departments, known collectively as 'Jupiter Division', are transporting ships and personnel to the HIP 54530 system. »

Other sources confirmed that the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has officially assumed the name Jupiter Division, suggesting that it was heavily infiltrated by Rochester's loyalists. The faction has retained control of the permit-locked HIP 54530 system.


* Warning of Ship Abductions by Fleet Carriers
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

This is an emergency bulletin to alert independent pilots that kidnappers are operating in the vicinity of the HR 6828 system.

The Pilots Federation has received reports of untrustworthy offers being made to Commanders who recently obtained their pilot's licence.

These involve the owners of Drake-class fleet carriers enticing a pilot to outfit their ship for mining operations, before docking with the larger vessel. It then makes a series of jumps, to a distant star system over 800 light years away, taking the docked ship with it.

The Commander is encouraged to work on mining hotspots in order to produce income for the fleet carrier. However, their own ship's limited jump range means they are effectively marooned, and reliant upon the fleet carrier to be returned to their starting system.

All pilots are therefore advised to beware of hails directing them to HR 6828 or systems in that area. It is also important to exercise extreme caution when docking with any fleet carrier whose owner is unknown.

The Pilots Federation has requested that this bulletin be shared by all members across public channels. It has also been distributed to major newsfeeds including The Alliance Tribune, The Federal Times, The Imperial Herald and Vox Galactica.


* Fleet Admiral Vincent Pronounced Guilty
A Federal High Court jury has found Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and treason.

The court heard how Vincent worked with Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester to sabotage Starship One and assassinate then-President Jasmina Halsey, in order to increase military contracts.

The Federal Times's crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi observed:

« Within minutes of Vincent receiving a life sentence, Federal Intelligence Agency teams arrested several co-conspirators in the Federal Navy along with some government officials. »

« Jupiter Rochester himself has evaded arrest by fleeing to the HIP 54530 system, where loyalists within Core Dynamics are establishing a breakaway faction named Jupiter Division. Industry analysts believe that this corporate split has long been planned, but is being accelerated because of the trial. »

« Rochester's responsibility for the Starship One tragedy raises many questions, especially for his powerful family. It will certainly fuel the conspiracy theory that he is a member of a covert group of powerful figures, who manipulate events to benefit the military/industrial complex. »

« However, a more plausible theory \u2013 that Zachary Hudson was responsible \u2013 now seems to have been debunked. Nothing presented in court suggested that the president had any involvement in, or knowledge of, the plan to eliminate his predecessor. »


* Jupiter Rochester Goes Rogue from Core Dynamics
Several departments loyal to the Core Dynamics CEO have seceded to form an independent corporate republic called Jupiter Division.

During the recent trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, Jupiter Rochester was named as the paymaster behind the sabotage of Starship One. This hastened long-term plans to abscond from Core Dynamics along with many ships and personnel.

In the permit-locked HIP 54530 system, the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has been renamed as Jupiter Division. It is assumed to have long been infiltrated by Rochester's loyalists.

Using the new self-appointed title of Supreme Executive Rochester, he broadcast this statement across all Federal media channels:

« For many years, I helped Core Dynamics become one of the galaxy's strongest companies, but petty laws and bureaucracy restricted me at every turn. I have always felt that people should not be ruled by politicians, but by those holding true economic power \u2013 the corporations. »

« It will be a long time before I can act on my commercial plans, but I will prove that corporate rule is the most beneficial system of governance for the Federation. »

Jupiter Rochester is the eldest son of Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester, and a key member of the influential Rochester family. As yet there have been no public statements from his mother or siblings.


* Takeover of Lakon Spaceways Declared Illegal
The acquisition of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics has been revoked following revelations of illegal activity.

An inquiry by the Independent Commission for Market Equality stated that former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester « exerted unduly influence on Lakon shareholders, including bribery and blackmail ». This led to new appointees to the board of directors, who were paid to approve the hostile takeover.

The inquiry also factored in the recent Federal High Court trial, which proved that Jupiter Rochester was directly responsible for the destruction of Starship One in 3301. In both cases, he set up shell companies to move enormous funds via unregistered banking systems.

Core Dynamics refused to comment on the allegations, but its legal team has terminated the transfer process. The entire corporation is currently in disarray due to several departments becoming an independent faction under the name Jupiter Division.

At Lakon Spaceways, Trent Delaney and several other directors have resigned. During an emergency meeting, a majority of stakeholders approved reinstating Naomi Landseer as chairperson.

With stock values plummeting and industry confidence low, the future of the company remains uncertain. However, Sirius Corporation confirmed that it has made preliminary offers with regards to acquiring Lakon as a subsidiary.


* Conflict Between Federal Forces and Jupiter Division
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Jupiter Division ships have engaged in battle with rival Federal vessels in the HIP 54530 system.

Loyalists to former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester have built their own breakaway faction in HIP 54530. The FIA suspects that Jupiter Division agents first infiltrated the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group years ago, and permit locked the system to conceal their efforts to overtake it from within.

The self-appointed Supreme Executive Rochester declared:

« The Federation is choking to death on its outdated bureaucracy \u2013 only corporate rule can save it! But first the galactic community must protect my followers, so I can establish a permanent base of operations. »

Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group announced:

« We will not tolerate these criminals illegally controlling this system. Once victory is won, the Federation will be able to bring Rochester to justice. »

Jupiter Division has offered generous rewards to any pilots willing to help secure its presence in the HIP 54530 system. The Silver Legal Group has asked Federal auxiliaries to support its efforts to degrade Jupiter Division's military force.

The Pilots Federation has agreed to supply all ships participating in this conflict with temporary permits to access HIP 54530. These will expire early on Thursday the 18th of February 3307.

However, neither permanent nor temporary system permits apply to fleet carriers, since they are capable of ferrying vessels which could evade detection and authorisation.


* Enhanced Missile Rack Initiative Concludes
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Deliveries of mined materials have allowed the engineer Liz Ryder to make a one-off modified ship module widely available.

The module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was only available for a brief period in October 3306, but can now be purchased from any human technology broker.

Freshly mined bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium were delivered by a large number of pilots. Due to the volume of shipments received, the initial amount of materials required by customers to purchase the weapon has been temporarily reduced.

Liz Ryder made this statement from her Demolition Unlimited workshop:

« Thank you to everyone who helped launch \u2013 so to speak \u2013 this module onto the market. I hope that engineers and tech brokers can continue working together on providing more options to the galactic community. »

Pilots who delivered commodities for this initiative can now collect their rewards from Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.


* Empire and Marlinists Prepare for Galactic Summit
Delegations have been formed by the Empire and the Marlinist Colonies to take part in the forthcoming diplomatic conference.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval will not attend in person, but will be directly represented by Chancellor Anders Blaine. During the conference, Senator Zemina Torval will temporarily assume chancellor duties and act as head of the Senate.

In addition, Princess Aisling Duval and Senator Denton Patreus will be in attendance. They will be accompanied by experienced ambassadors from the Imperial Diplomatic Corps.

The Marlinist Colonies have also finalised their delegation, which includes First Minister Jenna Fairfax and Minister Aaron Whyte. A spokesperson for the Marlinist Parliament said:

« The Galactic Summit offers us an opportunity to engage with the Empire diplomatically, and we sincerely hope our voices will be heard. We also aim to establish mutually beneficial relations with other governments. »

There is widespread speculation on how the Empire will respond to political overtures from its own ex-citizens, who were persecuted for following the democratic ideology of Marlinism. However, most societies within the Marlinist Colonies still remain culturally Imperial in nature, despite their republican governance.

The Galactic Summit is being hosted by Sirius Corporation and will officially commence on Thursday the 25th of February 3307.


* Federation Damaged by Corruption and Conspiracy
Federal citizens are in uproar after the former CEO of Core Dynamics was revealed to have destroyed Starship One to increase company profits.

The trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent showed that Jupiter Rochester attempted to replace Jasmina Halsey with Zachary Hudson to secure military contracts with the Federal Navy.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has arrested several co-conspirators, but its investigation is hampered by Jupiter Rochester loyalists splitting away from Core Dynamics. His new independent faction, Jupiter Division, has engaged in conflict against Federal forces in the HIP 54530 system.

President Hudson has claimed ignorance of the assassination plot, but public opinion polls show a decrease of trust in the Republican Party. Many have voiced anger at such corruption at the heart of the Federation, calling for further investigations into the corporate sector's influence on government.

Political embarrassment has also affected the Liberal Party, with Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester attempting to distance herself from her eldest son:

« Jupiter's horrendous actions were his alone, made completely without our knowledge. My whole family is appalled at his illegal activity. We have offered to aid the authorities in bringing him to justice. »


* Alliance Bales Out Lakon Spaceways
The Alliance Assembly has approved purchasing a majority sharehold in Lakon Spaceways, gaining partial ownership of the shipbuilding company.

An acquisition attempt by Federal corporation Core Dynamics was recently revoked due to illegal practices by its former CEO Jupiter Rochester. The Alliance has now rescued Lakon from possible insolvency, using government funding to buy shares and increase investment.

Naomi Landseer, the reinstated chairperson of Lakon's board of directors, announced:

« We welcome becoming closer partners with the Alliance, which we see as a natural progression following successful collaboration on past projects. I'm pleased to inform customers that the manufacture of Lakon vessels will continue uninterrupted. »

Although some Assembly members voted against the decision, including election candidate Nakato Kaine, there is broad public and industry approval. The Council of Admirals has expressed gratitude that a key defence contractor will not be controlled by another superpower or corporation.

Much of Lakon's personnel and resources will migrate to Alliance space, although its range of ships will remain available for purchase across the galaxy. Plans to construct a new headquarters for Lakon Spaceways within the Alioth system are well underway.


* Rare Goods Required for Galactic Summit
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has requested deliveries of consumables to Luyten's Star for the forthcoming diplomatic conference.

The Galactic Summit will take place in the Sirius system and last for three weeks, beginning on Thursday the 25th of February. It will be attended by leaders from the Alliance, Empire and Federation, plus representatives from independent systems.

Sirius Corporation has placed orders for these rare commodities: Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy.

All shipments are to be delivered to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system. They will then be ferried to Sirius before the conference begins.

CEO Li Yong-Rui discussed these preparations at a media event:

« We will provide all honoured delegates with a comfortable, luxurious environment. This includes offering the finest cuisine from across the galaxy. »

Several journalists pointed out that both the Alliance and Empire had registered official complaints about the Galactic Summit's location being situated deep within Federal space. Li Yong-Rui responded:

« I assure you that the Sirius system is politically neutral territory, and Sirius Corporation remains independent from the Federation. I can personally guarantee the safety and diplomatic immunity of all attendees. »


* Victory for Federal Forces Against Jupiter Division
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Jupiter Division, the breakaway faction from Core Dynamics, has been defeated in the HIP 54530 system.

The independent corporate nation met armed resistance from a local faction, the Silver Legal Group, which defeated them in battle with the aid of independent ships. Director Theodore Sullivan announced:

« Thanks to the courage of many pilots, we have crippled the military forces behind this illegal coup and taken control of the system. »

Rewards for all who fought for the Silver Legal Group are available from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.

The Silver Legal Group has been awarded permit control to prevent any further compromise of Federal assets. Pilots without this permit can perform missions for the faction at the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in Ts'ao Tach to access the HIP 54530 system.

Remnants of Jupiter Division confirmed that despite their defeat, all those who sided with them during the conflict will be reimbursed at the Victory's Forge megaship in the HIP 55014 system.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has taken Jupiter Rochester into custody, where he will be charged for his involvement in the destruction of Starship One in 3301. Thousands of his loyalist followers have also been apprehended, and the return of stolen Core Dynamics ships and resources is being arranged.


* Lakon Spaceways HQ Moves to Alioth System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The capital system of the Alliance now hosts Lakon's administrative hub and offers a 5% discount on its ships.

The company's main offices have been relocated to the Lakon Spaceways Central planetary port on Alioth 1 a.

All shipyards within the Alioth system are offering a permanent 5% discount on sales of vessels manufactured by Lakon. Pilots will need to obtain a permit for Alioth to take advantage of this reduction.

Both the move and the discount reflect the Alliance's recent purchase of a majority sharehold in the company. This was primarily to retain it as a key defence contractor for the Alliance Defence Force.

Naomi Landseer, chairperson of the board of directors, announced:

« We are extremely pleased to be partnered with the Alliance, especially after recent tumultuous events. Lakon's highly regarded ships will remain available across the galaxy. »

The attempted takeover of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics was revoked due to revelations of illegal practices by its former CEO, Jupiter Rochester. Federal news sources have reported that a rapid restructure is taking place within Core Dynamics, alongside investigations by the Federal Intelligence Agency.


* Hudson and Winters Confirmed for Galactic Summit
President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters will both attend the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system.

The Federation will also be represented by ambassadors from the Federal Diplomatic Corps, as well as several civil and corporate interests.

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino reported for The Federal Times:

« President Hudson's personal presence at the Galactic Summit sends the message that he still holds the reins of power. He clearly hopes that facing off against the Empire's leaders will distract the public from the recent Jupiter Rochester scandals. »

« In his absence, Vice President Brad Mitchell will oversee congressional matters. There are rumours that Mitchell is positioning himself to challenge Hudson as the Republican Party candidate in the next election. »

« The conference also offers opportunities for Felicia Winters to appear presidential. She has eagerly agreed to meet the Marlinist Colonies delegation, having coordinated humanitarian aid for the refugees last year. »

« Winters has not asked Shadow VP Isolde Rochester to accompany her, perhaps as a rebuke for the criminal actions of her son. Furiously working on damage control for her family's name, the Rochester matriarch has taken Jupiter's two children into her care after his husband, Tomas Turai, filed for immediate divorce. »


* Alliance Protests Triggered by Cancelled Election
The postponement of the election for a new prime minister has led to widespread public disorder across Alliance systems.

The Alliance Assembly vote was scheduled for Thursday the 25th of February. This date clashed with the start of the Galactic Summit, causing incumbent Prime Minister Edmund Mahon to propose that the election be delayed for three months.

On many Alliance worlds, large-scale protest marches have placed pressure on local police forces. Some civil leaders have condemned Mahon for using the diplomatic conference as an excuse to extend his term of office.

Mahon has referred to the unrest as being caused by a « vocal minority of agitators », and insisted that the delay is in the Alliance's best interests.

Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon's main rival, has given the protests her full support. She has become a figurehead for public dissent, with some political pundits suggesting that she might have won the election had it been held this week.

Speaking to The Alliance Tribune, Councillor Kaine said:

« This is the latest in a string of short-sighted decisions, and it's clear that the people no longer trust their prime minister. For this reason, despite believing the Galactic Summit to be a waste of time, I will be attending the conference to ensure that Mahon's agenda does not dominate proceedings. »


* Galactic Summit Begins with Defence Request
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Federation is working with Sirius Corporation to offer bounty hunting opportunities to protect the diplomatic conference.

The first Galactic Summit has officially opened at Patterson Enterprise station in the Sirius system. Temporary permits have been issued to all arriving delegates and Commanders for the three weeks of its term, although these do not apply to fleet carriers.

 Sirius Corporation's CEO Li Yong-Rui announced:

« The data supplied to us in January revealed several unanticipated threats, putting additional strain on our navy and security forces. Working with the generous support of the Federation, we have placed bounties on all wanted ships to ensure delegates' safety. Pilots defending the Sirius system will be rewarded for handing in bounty vouchers at the Spirit of Laelaps. »

The joint initiative will run for one week, after which Sirius Corporation will partner with the Empire to provide for the needs and security of the conference.

In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are celebrating the political gathering of all three superpowers with a 10% discount on their ships during the next three weeks.

Delegations have begun to arrive and formal introductions are taking place, with much media attention. This is the first time that universally recognised figures such as President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Princess Aisling Duval have been seen side by side.


* Rare Goods Received for Political Delegates
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

A wide range of luxurious food and drink for the Galactic Summit has been delivered to the Sirius Corporation.

Orders were placed for Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy. Large quantities of these rare items were shipped to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system.

The consumables will be ferried to the nearby Sirius system, where the diplomatic conference will take place. This initiative was considered a priority, since some delegates only agreed to attend if their requests for these rarities were met.

CEO Li Yong-Rui has expressed his personal thanks to all pilots who delivered the rare goods, who can now collect their payment at Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system.

Sirius Corporation has been organising the Galactic Summit for the past month, which has involved increased freight runs into its home system as well as heightened security. Preparations are now complete, and the first ambassadors from the Alliance, Empire and Federation are on their way.


* Historic Meetings at the Galactic Summit
Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders have held their first ever face-to-face discussions at the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system.

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling published this report for Vox Galactica:

« The Galactic Summit has already made history by bringing together many political figureheads within one conference chamber. Optimistic opening statements from Chancellor Anders Blaine and Prime Minister Edmund Mahon gained applause. President Zachary Hudson was more curt, reminding everyone that billions of people would be affected by their efforts. »

« Agendas and debate topics for the next three weeks were formalised. Much of the work will be done behind the scenes by ambassadorial staff, making big decisions in small rooms. »

« The general tone so far has been courteous, although that may not last. Predictably, interactions between the Imperial and Marlinist delegations have been frosty, with Senator Denton Patreus refusing to even acknowledge their presence during discussions. »

« However, First Minister Jenna Fairfax enjoyed a more cordial meeting with Shadow President Felicia Winters. They were joined by Jasmina Halsey, who has accompanied Winters from Mars in an unofficial capacity. »

« One notable absentee was Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, whose family is under legal scrutiny following the crimes of his older brother Jupiter Rochester. This at least spared Jordan the awkwardness of having to formally greet his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Princess Aisling Duval. But it's likely there will be no shortage of tension between other delegates in the coming weeks. »


* Galactic Summit Imperilled by Political Frictions
Delegates at the diplomatic conference have clashed over long-standing political issues, with some threatening to abandon the event.

Journalists at Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system reported their observations via mainstream newsfeeds.

The Imperial Herald: « Minister Whyte's claim that the Empire had fomented terrorism by repressing Marlinism was somewhat predictable. But nobody expected Princess Duval's icy retort, which caused shocked gasps across the chamber. »

Sol Today: « President Hudson easily dealt with Patreus's whine about the Federation's so-called 'war-mongering', putting the bombastic Imp in his place. »

Eye on Achenar: « The dull-witted thug of a president was no match for Senator Patreus, who received cheers for his condemnation of typical 'Fedneck' arrogance. »

The Alliance Tribune: « The conference's hosts were visibly embarrassed by Councillor Kaine's claims that Coalsack Nebula terraforming projects had triggered recent Thargoid attacks. Shockingly, several delegates dismissed this as an internal matter for the Alliance. »

The Federal Times: « Chancellor Blaine's stonewalling on the co-funding of humanitarian aid brought a rare flash of anger from Felicia Winters: 'Maybe the Emperor's puppet could loosen a few strings?' »

The Sovereign: « Despite Prime Minister Mahon exaggerating the benefits of Alliance membership, several independent ambassadors complained about its incomprehensible bureaucracy, saying it would be less damaging to declare war against the Alliance than join it. »

A representative from Sirius Corporation reported that the Galactic Summit was « going well ».


* Superpowers Make Progress at the Galactic Summit
Leaders from the Alliance, Empire and Federation have agreed a series of minor treaties at the diplomatic gathering in the Sirius system.

Vox Galactica featured this report from political correspondent Conrad Sterling:

« Following days of heated arguments, temperatures in the conference chamber finally cooled enough for all three superpowers to formalise a raft of agreements. These were ratified in person by Chancellor Blaine, President Hudson and Prime Minister Mahon. »

« The most significant of these treaties is the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, named after its two leading proponents. This requires the Alliance, Empire and Federation to share information on any large-scale threats to civilian populations, including environmental, medical and xenological crises. »

« There has been slow progress on other topics, such as military limitation and border control. Many independent ambassadors are demanding to prioritise debates on the Thargoid issue, and especially the defensive role played by Aegis. »

« Outside the chamber, First Minister Fairfax invited Princess Duval to a small ceremony to honour her late father. Fairfax formally apologised for Prince Harold's death and condemned the terrorists responsible. Aisling Duval gracefully accepted this, but time will tell if it was an empty gesture or the first step toward Imperial-Marlinist rapprochement. »


* Defence and Delivery Requests for the Sirius System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Empire is aiding Sirius Corporation by offering bounty hunting and trade opportunities to support the Galactic Summit.

The diplomatic conference is now entering its second week, with superpower and independent leaders gathered at Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system.

Sirius Corporation's CEO Li Yong-Rui announced:

« Our thanks to the Federation for organising additional security against unexpected numbers of vessels this past week. Anarchic extremists, political enemies and opportunistic criminals all attempted to disrupt the conference to no avail. Pilots who helped maintain the peace can collect their rewards at the Spirit of Laelaps. »

« For the coming week, we are working with the Empire to maintain the security operation by offering bounties on all wanted ships. The Empire will also pay generously for extra supplies of animal meat, coffee, fish, fruit and vegetables, and wine that are delivered to the Spirit of Laelaps. »

Pilots are reminded that neither permanent nor temporary permits to enter the Sirius system apply to fleet carriers. This joint initiative will run for one week, followed by Sirius Corporation partnering with the Alliance for the final week of the Galactic Summit.

In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are continuing to offer a 10% discount on all their ships to mark the historic occasion.


* Archon Delaine Gatecrashes the Galactic Summit
Pirate warlord Archon Delaine has unexpectedly appeared at the diplomatic conference and demanded to participate as a political delegate.

Delaine is the leader of the Kumo Crew, a notorious crime syndicate that controls dozens of systems. Their arrival at Patterson Enterprise station initially caused many delegations' security teams to begin evacuations.

However, representatives of the Sirius Corporation called for calm and delivered this message:

« We have vouchsafed Archon Delaine's presence and extended full diplomatic immunity to his retinue. As with all attendees, they are expected to abide by our rules and etiquettes. »

This reassurance did not prevent several ambassadors from walking out in protest. Some accused Sirius Corporation of striking a deal with Delaine to prevent even more pirate vessels from swarming through the Sirius system.

Mainstream newsfeeds also covered the impact of Delaine's arrival.

The Imperial Herald: « Senator Patreus officially complained about 'the repulsive sight of pirate scum strolling alongside respectable politicians'. However, Chancellor Blaine agreed that Delaine could address the conference, albeit under close scrutiny. »

The Federal Times: « Neither Hudson nor Winters have commented on Delaine's appearance, but the security chief for the Federal delegation remarked: 'One wrong step and we'll put some big holes right through their immunity.' »

The Alliance Tribune: « This is an unwelcome distraction from Prime Minister Mahon's proposal for Aegis's remit to be enormously expanded. The Sirius Treaty will fully unite superpowers, corporations and independent systems against the Thargoids \u2013 assuming that Mahon can convince his fellow leaders to agree. »


* Jupiter Rochester Sentenced to Life Imprisonment
Former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester has received a summary judgement for multiple crimes against the Federation.

The Federal Justice Department gave this statement:

« The facts in the case of Jupiter Rochester are self-evident. His principal role regarding Starship One and Jupiter Division make him guilty of treason, mass murder and many other crimes. He will serve a solitary life sentence in a maximum security prison. »

Milandu Okoro of the Federal Attorney's Office expressed surprise:

« It is highly unusual for the FJD not to litigate such a major case, considering we don't know the full extent of Rochester and Fleet Admiral Vincent's conspiracies. Unfortunately, our request to open a full investigation has been denied. »

Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester has reiterated that her family were not involved with her eldest son's clandestine activities.

Core Dynamics is continuing to rebuild after several departments separated to form Jupiter Division. Owen McKenna, the new CEO, has vowed to purge the company of all his predecessor's loyalists.

Despite Rochester's failure to build a powerbase in the HIP 54530 system, his manifesto of placing the Federation under direct corporate rule has received praise in some regions. A corporatist movement, founded by commercial networks and civil groups, is gradually gaining popularity.


* The Declaration of Archon Delaine
At the Galactic Summit, the infamous pirate leader Archon Delaine has demanded to be accepted as the legitimate leader of a political power.

A gap in the schedule allowed him to make an address in the main conference chamber:

« Most of you see me as a common criminal, rather than the rightful ruler of multiple systems. That must end now! My efforts to build a Kumo nation deserve respect. I am here to declare my sovereignty and take my rightful place on the political stage. »

This was immediately dismissed by many delegations. Princess Aisling Duval said this was a barbaric mockery of nobility, while Shadow President Winters asked how much bloodshed the pirates had caused to obtain their power. Archon Delaine replied:

« Are you all so innocent, then? Every civilisation begins with barbarism, and maintains authority with the threat of violence. None of you can say otherwise. We all wear a crown of bones. »

There followed intense debate as to whether the Kumo Crew's territory could be recognised as a new nation-state or was simply a rebranded crime syndicate. There is suspicion that some of the many criminal vessels detected in the Sirius system are from Delaine's pirate fleet.

The Federal and Imperial delegations have offered to remove Archon Delaine's retinue, only to be reminded that Sirius Corporation has granted them full diplomatic immunity.


* Thargoid Conflict Discussed at the Galactic Summit
Potential solutions to the threat posed by the Thargoid race are being debated at the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system.

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling reported for Vox Galactica:

« As always, the topic of the Thargoids brings division. The Alliance delegation has portrayed the aliens as a universal danger, while the Empire and Federation took a more balanced view. »

« Professor Alba Tesreau's plea to increase support for Aegis was well received, but many delegates argued that further anti-xeno breakthroughs were needed to justify additional funding. To this end, Aegis will undertake new research into the Guardians, hoping to discover a technological advantage from that ancient species. »

« Prime Minister Mahon's proposal for strategic cooperation against the Thargoids \u2013 known as the Sirius Treaty \u2013 is now being examined in detail. Supporters view it as a logical progression from the recently agreed Cornelius-Lasky Convention. »

« There was minor uproar when Archon Delaine agreed to be a signatory. Coupled with similar commitments from the Marlinist Colonies and other independents, this has brought pressure upon the Empire and Federation to follow suit. »

« If ratified, the Sirius Treaty could be the crowning achievement of the conference. However, putting it into practice will require a huge influx of resources. Decisions are expected before the end of this week. »


* Galactic Mysteries: The Adamastor
Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe, two detectives from the Wallglass Investigations Agency, examine the background of the Adamastor megaship.

Gunnarson: « When Wolfe and I started this project, we knew this case would come first. We're both prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Benjamin Chester, creator of the Wallglass Archive. He retired years ago, but that old spark kicked in when a 'ghost ship' turned up on his doorstep! »

« The Adamastor is a 200 year old derelict that drifted into the Chukchan system on autopilot. It's still there, with the Alliance Salvage Guild poking through its guts. Chester investigated its owners, a super-secretive company called Azimuth Biochemicals. We don't know what they were searching for, but what they found was possibly the first recorded Thargoid encounter. »

« I've since tracked down evidence that the Adamastor had a sister ship \u2013 the Hesperus \u2013 which in 3113 was sent to\u2026 somewhere! Neither ship returned, but we only know what happened on the Adamastor mission. Of course, Wolfe had to go see that with her own eyes. »

Wolfe: « Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 is a busy system nowadays, but was unexplored when Professor Carver's survey team were there. Listening to their logs from two centuries ago while examining the research base was chilling\u2026 ghost voices from a ghost ship. »

« There was evidence of blast scars, but I've seen enough battlefields to know what exchanged gunfire looks like. Azimuth's mercenaries weren't just firing at Thargoids, but at someone who shot back with laser rifles. »

« Gunnarson tells me Azimuth was swallowed up by a rival called Pharmasapien. Did they infiltrate the Adamastor and try to take over? Or did the thing that Carver captured drive everyone insane? »

« This is a seriously cold case, even for us. But maybe one day, more tantalising clues will emerge. And that's what we live for. »


* Galactic Summit Cancelled \u2013 NMLA Attacks Superpowers
The conference in the Sirius system has ended prematurely after terrorist bombings against nine starports across the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

Sirius Corporation confirmed that the cancellation was due to fears that Patterson Enterprise station may be the next target. All scheduled business, including finalising the Sirius Treaty, has been halted. The delegations are returning to their home systems under high security.

Temporary permits for the Sirius system will remain in place for one week. Pilots who contributed to the security and trade initiatives held in partnership with the Empire can collect their rewards at the Spirit of Laelaps. Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways will continue to offer a 10% discount on all their ships for one more week.

The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the simultaneous attacks in nine systems, including superpower capitals Achenar, Alioth and Sol.

The following message was broadcast on NMLA propaganda channels:

« I no longer have a name. Nor a family. Nor a future. Each taken by the Empire. Now all I have is the dehumanising number printed on my uniform in their torture chambers. Now all I am is Theta Seven. »

« The Alliance and Federation's rulers have revealed themselves as imperialist supporters of the Duval dynasty, which has crushed our ideals for a thousand years. Peoples of the galaxy \u2013 you can change this. We give you your own Nine Martyrs. Use them to retake control and regain your power. »

Media newsfeeds are detailing the impact and implications of the attacks. There is speculation that NMLA activists were concealed among Marlinist refugees that fled to Alliance and Federation space to escape Imperial persecution.

The Marlinist Parliament has officially stated it has « no connection to Neo-Marlinist extremists », and that it will cooperate with security and emergency services during this crisis.


* Nine Starports Hit by Terrorist Bombings
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Explosions have struck starports across the Alliance, Empire and Federation in a coordinated bombing attack by the NMLA.

The capital systems of all three superpowers \u2013 Achenar, Alioth and Sol \u2013 have been targeted by the terrorists, as well as six other high-population systems. Precise casualty numbers are unavailable, but several hundred thousand people have been killed with many more injured.

There are urgent calls for independent pilots to rescue survivors and support repair operations at all nine locations:

Dawes Hub in the Achenar system

Donaldson in the Alioth system

Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system

Hahn Gateway in the Nanomam system

Ito Orbital in the Rhea system

Lave Station in the Lave system

Li Qing Jao in the Sol system

Parkinson Dock in the Eotienses system

Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system

The explosive damage to each station is consistent with corrosive enzyme weapons previously used by the NMLA. This has triggered automated systems designed to respond to Thargoid assaults.

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy are on full alert. Other military and security forces across the core systems are preparing for possible further attacks.

The Galactic Summit has been temporarily suspended while Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders respond to the emergency. A full lockdown is in effect in the Sirius system, where the scheduled bounty hunting and trade initiatives have been cancelled.


* Starport Bombing Casualties Include Federal Vice President
Vice President Brad Mitchell and a number of Federal Cabinet members have been killed in the recent terrorist attack on a starport orbiting Earth.

The NMLA planted caustic enzyme explosives at Li Qing Jao station, where a government meeting was taking place. The VP and Cabinet members were confirmed to be among tens of thousands of casualties. Eight other starports across all three superpowers were simultaneously bombed.

President Zachary Hudson, who was attending the Galactic Summit during the attack, made this statement:

« This atrocity is nothing less than a declaration of war, and we will respond accordingly. For now, we mourn the loss of my close friend Brad Mitchell and other heroes of the Federation. I will personally appoint replacements to their positions soon. »

The Federation has directly accused the Empire of being responsible, by allowing Neo-Marlinist bomb-makers to escape from a secret prison facility. The Imperial Senate reiterated that 'Serene Harbour' does not exist and is part of a Federal disinformation campaign.

Followers of Marlinism have also received much public criticism. The Marlinist Colonies have repeatedly stressed that they do not support the NMLA and are unconnected to the attacks.

Independent pilots have been asked to assist rescue and repair operations in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems.


* Superpowers Respond to 'Nine Martyrs' Attack
Political fallout has been intense after the NMLA simultaneously bombed nine starports in the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

The targeted stations are in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems. These were referred to by NMLA propaganda as the 'Nine Martyrs', a reference to the attack against Kepler Orbital last November.

All three superpowers are treating this as a major emergency. Top-level discussions have taken place between their chiefs of security, using communication protocols recently established at the Galactic Summit.

However, mainstream media has also reported on internal political tensions.

The Imperial Herald: « Senator Patreus proposed that all known Marlinists be arrested immediately as NMLA collaborators. He received a direct rebuke from Chancellor Blaine, who said 'Her Majesty views your blunt tactics as having been counter-productive, and requires more creative solutions.' »

The Federal Times: « President Hudson opened Congress with a minute's silence to honour VP Brad Mitchell and other deceased Cabinet members. He then directly blamed Shadow President Winters for their deaths, claiming 'You invited terrorists with your virtue-signalling aid programme for fake refugees!' »

The Alliance Tribune: « The Assembly broadly welcomed Prime Minister Mahon's call for unity against the NMLA, and praised his efforts on the Sirius Treaty despite it remaining unsigned. But there was also support for Councillor Kaine's viewpoint: 'Our entry fee for the Galactic Summit was hundreds of thousands of lives.' »


* Anti-NMLA Intelligence Unit Formed
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have created a centralised agency dedicated to investigating and eliminating the NMLA paramilitary group.

The new Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) is a direct result of the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which was signed at the Galactic Summit.

This treaty requires the superpowers to share information on any large-scale threats to civilian populations. With a combined death toll rising over half a million, the recent starport bombings have obtained such status.

ACT will be jointly led by the veterans of the tri-superpower taskforce that defeated the League of Reparation in 3304: Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service, Inspector Mara Klatt of Alliance Interpol, and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez of the Federal Intelligence Agency.

Captain Seutonia gave a brief statement:

« ACT is an independent organisation dedicated to bringing the NMLA to justice. We will draw resources from Alliance, Empire and Federation security forces and elsewhere. »

« However, we foresee the need for even larger numbers of dedicated personnel. Therefore, we have contacted the Pilots Federation for permission to invite independent pilots to gather information for us when necessary. »

Pilots are advised that civilians still require transportation from damaged starports in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems.


* Medical Supplies Needed for Starport Bombing Survivors
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Safeguard Interstellar requires deliveries of medicines to treat casualties from the NMLA's recent terrorist attack.

The humanitarian aid organisation is helping to coordinate relief efforts for the starports in the Alliance, Empire and Federation that were bombed last week. CEO Noel Beaumont announced:

« Hundreds of thousands of civilians still require urgent medical attention after being evacuated from the damaged stations. Many have severe caustic burns inflicted by the corrosive enzyme payload of the explosives. We have already exhausted the majority of supplies in nearby systems. »

« To reinforce overstretched health services, we request shipments of basic medicines and advanced medicines. These can be delivered to three starports being used as staging areas:  Krylov Ring in the He Bo system, Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system, and Davis Terminal in the Duamta system. »

Safeguard Interstellar has partnered with three local factions \u2013 Perez Ring Brewery, Lavigny's Legion and the Duamta Gold Creative Corp \u2013 to reward pilots and distribute the medicines within each superpower.

Pilots can provide further help by directly delivering repair materials to damaged starports in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam and Rhea systems. Li Qing Jao station in the Sol system remains an active disaster zone, with civilians still requiring evacuation.


* Galactic Mysteries: The NMLA
Private investigators Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe review the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.

Gunnarson: « We don't usually get involved with political cases, but it's hard to ignore the largest terrorist attack in history. »

« The NMLA is a radical offshoot of Marlinism, a democratic movement named after the Republic of Achenar's original ruler, Marlin Duval. Most are peaceful protester types, but Neo-Marlinists want to overthrow the government by permanently removing the Imperial Family. »

« What nobody knows is how the NMLA went from minor troublemakers to interstellar terrorists. The starport bombings last September came from nowhere, and their assassins have killed many Imperial bigwigs including Prince Harold Duval. »

« Smart money was on them being funded by Empire's enemies, but now the NMLA treat the Alliance and Federation as equal targets. Hitting all three superpower capitals was a hugely symbolic gesture, and should have been impossible. How did they bypass security and plant explosives without detection? Who the hell are these people? »

« Even Wallglass doesn't have a clue. But we won't stop searching. »

Wolfe: « Despite my enquiries \u2013 and some unauthorised snooping \u2013 there's no trace of the rumoured NMLA bomb factory in LTT 1935. But it did once exist, because the Empire captured its occupants. »

« Not that they'll admit it. 'There is no such place as Serene Harbour', right? Well, I've been to R CrA Sector AF-A d42 3b and seen it myself. It's bleak. Hope-crushing. And yet the NMLA prisoners listed as Theta Group escaped, broken out by what seems like Imperial Intelligence double-agents. »

« That genuinely scares me. If the NMLA can worm inside the most shadowy security organisation in known space, they could be anywhere. And none of us are safe. »


* ACT Gathers Intelligence on the NMLA
The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT), formed by all three superpowers to combat the NMLA, has launched its investigation.

The organisation has been working closely with Alliance Interpol, the Imperial Internal Security Service and the Federal Intelligence Agency to collate data on the terrorist strikes against nine starports.

Captain Niamh Seutonia, one of ACT's joint leaders, told the media:

« Initial forensic results from the targeted stations suggest the use of a more compact bomb design than in previous attacks, possibly constructed on-site. Worryingly, the NMLA's new generation of weapons seem to be easier to transport and conceal. »

« The good news is that a comparison of reports has revealed one very promising lead. I will personally take a team to follow this up, and we're hoping for an early breakthrough. »

Inspector Mara Klatt also provided a brief progress report:

« Our working theory is that the NMLA employs an undetectable interstellar communications system to coordinate its attacks. A similar dark-comms network was used by the League of Reparation before we decrypted it, but this version is evidently more sophisticated. We are liaising with local security services to gather evidence. »


* Marlinists Reject Accusations of Terrorist Links
The Marlinist Parliament has refuted widespread allegations of supporting or concealing members of the NMLA paramilitary group.

Fuelled by media speculation, many political and military leaders have suggested that the Marlinist Colonies should be occupied or destroyed to take revenge for the recent bombings. However, there is no evidence that these systems have any direct connection to the NMLA.

First Minister Jenna Fairfax gave this statement to Vox Galactica:

« The starport attacks were as sickening and terrifying to us as to the rest of the galaxy. The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army follows a twisted creed that has no bearing on true Marlinism. »

« We have sent our own intelligence team to join ACT, led by Captain Milo Castile of the Marlinist Constabulary. It is vital that we all work together to end the NMLA's campaign of terror. »

There was also a comment from fellow parliamentarian Aaron Whyte:

« I understand it's human nature to seek a villain, but we should remember that the Neo-Marlinist cause has sound political foundations. The Empire suppressed all republican movements for centuries, imprisoning and executing far more people than those who died in the 'Nine Martyrs'. »


* New Federal Vice President Selected
President Zachary Hudson has announced that the new vice president of the Federation is Jerome Archer, replacing the deceased Brad Mitchell.

Archer was previously serving as the Secretary of Security. Prior to becoming a congressman, he was a director of the Federal Intelligence Agency and had a long career in law enforcement.

His predecessor, VP Brad Mitchell, died in the NMLA bombing of Li Qing Jao station in the Sol system. The attack also killed several members of the Federal Cabinet along with many government officials, who were attending a meeting at the starport.

Addressing a gathering of Congress, Vice President Archer said:

« My primary focus in this office will be to increase security throughout the Federation. I vow to build vigilance into the fabric of our society, and prevent such atrocities from ever happening again. »

During the congressional session, President Hudson announced new appointments for other deceased members of the Cabinet. He also successfully obtained approval to increase funding for counter-terrorism operations run by ACT and the Federal Navy.


* ACT Requests Help to Locate Missing Agent
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Assistance is needed to track down an ACT operative who vanished while on a mission to identify NMLA suppliers.

The missing agent is Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service, one of the joint leaders of the anti-NMLA intelligence unit. She was following up on clues resulting from analysis of the 'Nine Martyrs' starport bombings.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, a co-leader of ACT, gave this statement:

« Captain Seutonia and her team were travelling on an Anaconda-class vessel named the Valkyrie. Mission details are scarce as information was compartmentalised for security, but she was investigating a minor faction that may be supplying the NMLA. »

« We know that her ship left the Mudhrid system on the 24th of March, on a heading toward the Marlinist Colonies. Captain Castile of the Marlinist Constabulary, on secondment to ACT, arranged a rendezvous that she never reached. So we know the Valkyrie went missing somewhere inbetween. »

« All Commanders in the region are asked to join the search for Captain Seutonia's ship. Our fervent hope is that we find its crew alive, and that they managed to obtain data to help us defeat the NMLA. »


* Medicines Delivered for Starport Bombing Survivors
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Safeguard Interstellar has successfully received medical supplies for civilians wounded during the NMLA terrorist attack.

The bombing of nine starports across the Alliance, Empire and Federation left huge numbers of people injured, some with caustic burns due to Thargoid enzymes deployed by the explosives.

Noel Beaumont, the aid organisation's CEO, announced:

« We are immensely grateful to all pilots who brought shipments of basic medicines and advanced medicines. These have been transported directly to the relevant systems, where they will be used to ease the suffering of several hundred thousand civilians. »

Safeguard Interstellar confirmed that its partner factions have made rewards available at the three systems used as staging areas for deliveries.

Pilots can collect from the Perez Ring Brewery at Krylov Ring in the He Bo system, Lavigny's Legion at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system, and the Duamta Gold Creative Corp at Davis Terminal in the Duamta system.

Over the past two weeks, emergency services have been concentrated on the nine damaged starports in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems. All survivors have been accounted for and repairs are largely completed, mainly due to dedicated support by members of the Pilots Federation.


* Jasmina Halsey Becomes Federal Ambassador
Former President Jasmina Halsey has joined the Federal Diplomatic Corps to become an ambassador to the Alliance.

In recent years Halsey served as an advisor to Prime Minister Mahon, but returned to the Federation in January to stand as a witness in the Starship One trial. She was a guest of Shadow President Felicia Winters at the Galactic Summit, and both were evacuated back to Mars when it was cancelled.

At a press conference, Ambassador Halsey said:

« Being at the conference reminded me that the political arena is where I belong. My new responsibilities allow me to continue serving the Federation while making use of my experience within the Alliance, and hopefully build stronger bridges between the two. »

Elijah Beck, head of the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations, sent this message:

« Jasmina's level-headed advice has calmed many tense political situations. This is the ideal role for a diplomat of her calibre, and I look forward to working with her again. »

In related news, the Federal Diplomatic Corps confirmed that Ambassador Jordan Rochester had been recalled from duty to be reassigned. Most of the Empire and Federation's embassies in each other's space have been closed since November 3306.


* Demands for Empire to Solve Terrorist Problem
The fear of further starport bombings has placed internal and external pressure on the Empire to address the threat posed by the NMLA.

Despite sharing intelligence via ACT, the Alliance and Federation have demanded that the Empire must do more to eradicate the NMLA, since it is 'Imperial in origin and ambition'.

The latest developments were covered by mainstream media channels.

The Imperial Herald: « In the Senate, Chancellor Anders Blaine reported that the Emperor has instructed him to present a range of options. Senator Lorcan Scordato has volunteered to visit the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission, to better understand the political character of the Neo-Marlinist fringe. »

Eye on Achenar: « The entire system is still shellshocked by the slaughter at Dawes Hub, a vicious stab at the heart of our glorious Empire. In our opinion poll, 93% of right-thinking citizens would send a fleet of Majestics to the murdering Marlinists instead of some soft-hearted senator. »

Vox Galactica: « In most Imperial cities and settlements, anxiety levels remain high. The NMLA's ability to strike seemingly anywhere has rocked public confidence in the Empire's strength. Opinions on Marlinism itself are more polarised than ever, with accusations of 'warmonger' and 'collaborator' dividing many families and relationships. »


* Federal Congress Grants Emergency Surveillance Powers
Vice President Jerome Archer has successfully proposed a new public surveillance law designed to prevent future terrorist attacks in the Federation.

The Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act was debated in Congress before being approved by a majority vote. It is considered to be emergency legislation that replaces all previous laws regarding monitoring civilian activity and intercepting personal communications.

Vice President Archer, who personally drafted much of the new statute, announced:

« This will allow the government to actively seek out any terrorist agents and sympathisers lurking within our communities. We will never again allow so many families and friends to be taken from us. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters responded:

« Nobody wants another 'Nine Martyrs', and it's vital that security is increased across the Federation. But this is an outrageous violation of civil liberties. For this administration to grant itself access to every citizen's private life makes it resemble a dictatorial regime. »

VP Archer later confirmed that he is already working with the heads of security services on practical applications of the new law. As a former director of the Federal Intelligence Agency, he is expected to make rapid progress.


* Crashed Ship of Missing ACT Agent Located
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The vessel of Captain Niamh Seutonia, who vanished on an anti-NMLA mission, has been found with its crew dead.

Following a widespread search by independent pilots, Commander TheRealFlame was the first to discover the wreckage of the Valkyrie in the Trianguli sector GW-W B1-0 system. It was apparent that the ship crashed after sustaining weapons fire, and that all crewmembers died on impact.

ACT co-leader Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez gave this statement to the media:

« We owe a debt to every pilot who joined our efforts to find the Valkyrie. It's an emotional blow for us to lose one of ACT's guiding lights, along with her courageous team. »

« However, Captain Seutonia managed to secure her mission logs moments before the ship's destruction. This allowed vital information to be recovered. »

« We now have evidence confirming that a Neo-Marlinist faction in the Mudhrid system was directly involved in the NMLA starport bombings. We have shared our findings with Imperial authorities, and the Order of Mudhrid is being investigated. »

Captain Niamh Seutonia rose to prominence as part of the tri-superpower taskforce that eliminated the League of Reparation in 3304. The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that she will be posthumously awarded the Achenar Service Cross.


* Empire Attacks Neo-Marlinist Faction
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Conflict has erupted between the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group and the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

An investigation by ACT in the Mudhrid system confirmed that the Order of Mudhrid provided logistical support for the NMLA's starport attacks. Their agents infiltrated other local factions to transport enzyme bombs to their targets.

The faction has now renamed itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, its leader, has declared a revolution against the Imperial Family. From his flagship, the Steel Majesty, he announced:

« The corrupt Duvals will never give up their power, so we must take it from them. All those who seek to change the established order \u2013 join us! »

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group responded by engaging their forces in battle. Senator Denton Patreus has ordered them to « take revenge for the 'Nine Martyrs' atrocities. »

This is the first instance of a faction openly adopting Neo-Marlinism, although it has not been officially recognised by the Marlinist Colonies. Minister Aaron Whyte commented:

« It's a lost opportunity that Landgrave Delacroix chose to aid extremists, rather than provide a political platform to the Neo-Marlinist community. I hope we can soon replace the cycle of violence with meaningful communication. »


* Galactic Mysteries: Generation Ships
Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe investigate the abandoned relics of spacefaring communities from the early years of colonisation.

Wolfe: « Generation ships are essentially mobile cities designed to carry expanding populations, and are always an impressive sight. But there's one I keep returning to \u2013 the Thetis, orbiting Nefertem 6 a. »

« Listening to its logs always chills my blood. They describe how a whispered phrase from an uninhabited planet somehow caused over 17,000 people to slaughter each other. Nobody knows if it was mass hysteria, psychological stress from decades in space, or\u2026 something else. »

« So many visits to the Thetis, and I still can't work up the nerve to play its final log entry. I've been warned that I won't be the same afterwards. »

Gunnarson: « Before hyperdrives, generation ships were a viable way to colonise distant star systems. Millions of people lived out their whole lives within self-contained societies, so their descendants might walk upon new worlds. »

« The tragedy is that many of these pioneering megaships vanished entirely, never reaching their destinations. But some were rediscovered, usually because of listening posts intercepting their ancient broadcasts. »

« There are various reasons why these expeditions failed. The Lazarus, now orbiting Virudnir 6, suffered mechanical breakdowns whereas the Pleione, in the Hez Ur system, had a population that only produced male babies. »

« Most disturbing are those where the crew descended into barbarism, like the Artemis at Mu Cassiopeia C 1 and the Demeter in the Mizuchi system. Along with Wolfe's favourite \u2013 if that's the right word \u2013 these stand as horrific monuments to our darker natures. »

« Lost generation ships rarely carry survivors, but that was the case with the Golconda, whose people now occupy an outpost on Upaniklis B 3. So perhaps more living relics are still adrift in the void, waiting to complete centuries-long missions. »


* The Wedding of Hadrian Duval
Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, leader of the isolationist group Nova Imperium, has married his consort Astrid Minerva in a closed ceremony.

Commander Minerva was a young Imperial pilot who aided Nova Imperium at the Battle of Paresa in 3305 and became a loyal supporter. Her official title is now Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval.

Princess Aisling Duval personally attended her cousin's wedding at a secure location. She referred to it as « a precious moment of joy in these bleak times ».

The Imperial Palace and the Senate have sent congratulatory messages, and the event was covered by mainstream media.

Paresa News Network: « Astrid's well-deserved rise to nobility has made her fellow Paresans very proud. Everyone at PNN is overjoyed for the happy couple! »

Eye on Achenar: « It's an insult to the noble Duval bloodline when some trigger-jockey from a gutter system can sink her claws into the Emperor's own nephew. »

The Imperial Herald: « Hadrian taking a bride at the age of 20 has surprised many. If he becomes the only Duval to produce heirs, it will place pressure on Emperor Arissa and Princess Aisling, neither of whom have consorts. »

In related news, Nova Imperium vessels are participating in the current conflict against the Neo-Marlinists of Mudhrid. Praetor Leo Magnus, head of security, is liaising with the IISS on anti-terrorism intelligence.


* Federation Begins Anti-Terrorist Monitoring
The Proactive Detection Bureau has been set up by the Federal Intelligence Agency to scan civilian communications for signs of terrorist activity.

The new department was formed following congressional approval of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act. This was drafted by Vice President Jerome Archer, who told the media:

« The PDB is a vital tool to prevent further massacres on the scale we have recently witnessed. It will unearth NMLA terrorists and other dangerous activists concealed among innocent citizens, and help keep our families safe. »

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who has been appointed to run the Proactive Detection Bureau, explained its operations:

« Highly advanced algorithms will scan all data transmitted across public and private networks on a system-wide level. Any suspicious communications are redirected to a regional hub, for review by trained investigators. »

« It is important to understand that only specific activity within narrow parameters will be flagged, and must pass dozens of automated checkpoints before our operatives can access it. »

Shadow President Winters and civil rights groups have protested that this violates long-standing privacy laws. However, President Hudson has championed the PDB as a cornerstone of the new counter-terrorism statutes.


* Neo-Marlinist Faction Defeated in Battle
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Mudhrid system conflict has ended with the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group overcoming the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

This was triggered by ACT discovering that the Neo-Marlinist faction had provided transports and logistical support for the NMLA's attacks against nine starports.

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group has thanked all pilots who contributed to its triumph. Rewards are now available at Payne-Scott City in the Mudhrid system.

Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, ruler of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, has so far evaded capture. He managed to broadcast this message:

« Those brave warriors who fought for our cause can receive recompense at the Steel Majesty. One day we will slay the Duvals and bring revolution to the Empire! »

Inspector Mara Klatt of ACT told the media:

« This is a definite victory against the NMLA. It also provides an insight into their modus operandi \u2013 promising disenfranchised or delusional leaders, such as Landgrave Delacroix, increased status in the new Republic should they succeed. We assume they used similar third parties to support the Alliance and Federation bombings. »

« Our agents are gathering information, but it's clear that the NMLA's network is more advanced and widespread than we first suspected. »


* The Awakening of the Adamastor
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Adamastor, a 200 year old 'ghost ship' in orbit around Chukchan 5 b, has received a mysterious encrypted signal. The derelict vessel has been undergoing investigation by Alliance Salvage Guild teams since its discovery last October. They released this report:

« Months ago, we cut open one of the Adamastor's damaged cargo holds to find an undeployed communications beacon. We managed to power it up, but it contained no data and had never been used. »

« This beacon has now automatically activated, and is receiving and rebroadcasting a long-range signal. The transmission's source cannot be identified, but is definitely of interstellar origin. Its encoded content has yet to be deciphered. »

The Adamastor vanished in 3111 after an incident that may have involved the first historical encounter with the Thargoids. It reappeared in 3306 when it entered the Chukchan system at sublight speeds on autopilot, with no sign of its crew.

It was recently learned that in 3113 the Adamastor's sister ship, the Hesperus, also disappeared. Both were owned by a corporation called Azimuth Biochemicals, which was absorbed by a rival named Pharmasapien. Little is known about either company, but it is believed they were competitors in the field of xenological research.


* Imperial Senator Visits Marlinist Colonies
Senator Lorcan Scordato has visited the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission as part of the Empire's anti-terrorism operations.

The Imperial Herald was permitted to publish this summary of his preliminary report:

« Considering their recent refugee status, the Marlinist communities are remarkably well-organised. Their government works along republican lines but they have not abandoned Imperial culture, with many feeling homesick for their original worlds. »

« However, their situation remains precarious, with three of their eight systems now under the control of external factions. Without increased support from the galactic community, further losses may be unavoidable. »

« Regarding the NMLA, there is widespread anger that they have made all Marlinists look like monsters. Only rarely did I sense guarded approval, with the vast majority openly condemning the terrorists. »

« The Marlinist Parliament is small but efficient, containing a spectrum of viewpoints. First Minister Fairfax is focused on cohesion and survival, Amrita Ross discussed future reintegration with the Empire, while Aaron Whyte sees Neo-Marlinism as a valid political movement if violence can be avoided. »

« Months ago these were ordinary Imperial citizens, and our shared history still binds us. Generally, I feel that the Marlinist Colonies are closer to allies than enemies in our war against the NMLA. »


* Galactic Mysteries: Dredger Clans
Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency discusses the nomadic tribes that wander the galaxy in converted dredger megaships.

« It's well known that there are many travelling communities \u2013 groups of people who prefer to live on the move rather than settle anywhere. Proudly independent, they survive on the fringes of civilisation and tend to avoid interacting with the authorities. Those commonly known as the Dredger Clans are among the most successful. »

« Dredger-class bulk cruisers convert both natural and man-made minerals into raw resources, to sustain themselves on deep-space voyages. Improved hyperdrives and fuel-scooping systems made this design redundant long ago, but some were taken over by nomads and kept operational. »

« These dredgers are now a type of generation ship. Each hosts tens of thousands of people, whose cultures have evolved \u2013 or devolved \u2013 over decades or centuries. Some are true loners while others have formed alliances, or occasionally gather to increase their gene pools. »

« Typically these clans act as scavengers, quickly passing through systems to steal anything not locked down. Several take what they need in more aggressive ways, such as raiding unprotected outposts. »

« A few have even darker reputations. I remember being told as a boy: 'If you don't behave, the Phagos take you away in your sleep and eat you up.' All my childhood nightmares came surging back when I discovered there may be some truth to that story. »

« More recently, I've heard rumours that a rarely seen Dredger Clan has resurfaced. Naturally, Wolfe has rushed off to find out more. Hopefully she'll be able to increase our limited knowledge of these mysterious tribes. »


* Federal Reactions to Communications Surveillance Programme
There have been mixed responses to the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors private communications in the Federation for terrorist activity.

Mainstream newsfeeds reported on the situation:

The Federal Times: « Civil rights groups are united in protest against the PDB. The controversy was also seized upon by the corporatist movement that was formed by Jupiter Division supporters. Their spokesperson stated: 'The government has overstepped its authority and must be replaced by direct corporate rule.' »

Sol Today: « Has everyone already forgotten Li Qing Jao station burning in the night skies above Earth? Whatever it takes to keep us safe must be done. Only people with something to hide demand secrecy. »

Vox Galactica: « Professor Irene Ralston of Olympus Village University told us that her political history students received visits by FIA agents for researching Marlinism, despite it being on the curriculum. »

The Tau Ceti Journal: « Corporations that incurred financial losses in the bombings have welcomed the PDB. But other businesses have submitted legal challenges, claiming a right to protect sensitive commercial information. Megacorps such as Caine Massey and Vandermeer are even threatening to withdraw political donations. »


* Archon Delaine Campaign to Build New Starports
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has launched an initiative to construct up to five starports to stimulate galactic trade.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, an independent construction company, has been privately contracted by the Kumo Council to build fully operational Orbis stations. These will be located in uninhabited systems close to key trading regions and areas of commercial interest.

The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed featured this statement from Archon Delaine:

« As sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation, it's my responsibility to increase prosperity for the systems under my protection. My new starports will extend our reach and boost trading of all kinds\u2026 legitimate and otherwise. »

« I have also placed bounties on the heads of anyone who dares to interfere with my plans. The one thing we never trade in is mercy. »

The Razor Whips, one of Delaine's loyal factions, is organising the campaign. It will reimburse pilots who deliver ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system.

The number of new starports will depend on the quantity of deliveries. The targeted locations are:

Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system

HIP 18390, near the California Nebula

HIP 10792, near the Sothis system

HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula

Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region


* Neo-Marlinists Seek Sanctuary at Marlinist Colonies
Survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid have arrived in the Marlinist Colonies, requesting political asylum from the Empire.

The faction was recently defeated by Imperial forces in the Mudhrid system, after an ACT investigation confirmed that it provided logistical support for the NMLA attacks on starports.

Landgrave Delacroix and his loyalists fled aboard the Steel Majesty megaship to the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system, which is controlled by the Marlinism Reformation Party. Minister Aaron Whyte, its elected leader, announced:

« Not every individual within the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid is an NMLA activist. We have the right to offer asylum to protect innocents from persecution, just as the Federation protected us when we were refugees. »

The Empire has officially demanded that the Neo-Marlinists be apprehended, with Senator Patreus claiming « The Landgrave of Mudhrid is a traitor and a war criminal. »

Both the Alliance and Federation have likewise insisted on their arrest. However, Shadow President Winters reminded Congress that the Marlinist Charter grants their systems the same legal powers of asylum as the Federation.

The Marlinist Parliament has declared an emergency situation. First Minister Fairfax called for a discussion of options, while Ministers Amrita Ross and Tamsin Taylor urged cooperation with the Empire.


* The Adamastor Enigma
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Commanders have reported receiving anonymous instructions regarding the 200 year old derelict megaship orbiting Chukchan 5 b.

A communications beacon stored onboard the Adamastor began receiving and rebroadcasting an encrypted signal on the 8th of April. Efforts by authorities to trace and decipher the signal proved unsuccessful.

However, a number of independent pilots claim to have been contacted by an anonymous source, who provided an access key to decode the Adamastor signal.

Commander Rex Trevelyan gave this statement to Vox Galactica:

« Not long after arriving in the Chukchan system, my ship received a message from someone calling himself 'Salvation'. He provided a decryption key, and when I downloaded the signal from the Adamastor it became readable. It seems to be an automatic SOS from its sister ship, the Hesperus. »

« I've heard that some Commanders have made sense of the navigational data in the signal. It feels like pilots are being recruited for something, but who exactly are we working for? »

The Pilots Federation has begun an inquiry into the situation. The identity of 'Salvation' remains unknown, but there are reports that the Adamastor signal contains data that has led to its sister ship.


* Conditional Amnesty Agreed for Neo-Marlinists
The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid has been granted sanctuary in the Marlinist Colonies in return for revealing the identities of the NMLA's leaders.

The faction's survivors arrived in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system after being defeated by Imperial forces. The Marlinism Reformation Party agreed to offer political asylum, despite all three superpowers demanding the refugees' arrest.

Imperial Senator Lorcan Scordato, who was visiting the Colonies on a fact-finding mission, announced:

« After meeting the Neo-Marlinists and the Marlinist Parliament, I have secured an agreement. The Landgrave of Mudhrid and his inner circle will cooperate fully with ACT to provide details on the senior leadership of the NMLA. In return, they will receive life imprisonment at a local detention facility. »

« The Steel Majesty's population will undergo security vetting by the Marlinist Constabulary to identify extremists. The remainder will be permitted to remain in the system and apply for citizenship. »

Chancellor Blaine has approved the proposal, commenting that it was « precisely the sort of creative solution the Emperor requires ». Responses from the Alliance and Federation were mixed, but there was broad agreement that targeting the NMLA was the priority.

Minister Aaron Whyte, elected leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, publicly thanked Senator Scordato for negotiating a peaceful resolution.


* Federal Surveillance Identifies Domestic Terrorists
The Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all civilian communications in the Federation, has detected several home-grown terrorist groups.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the Federal Investigations Agency told the media:

« Our combination of sophisticated algorithms and skilled operatives has unearthed over a dozen extremist organisations, all previously unknown. The FIA launched pre-emptive raids on these groups before they were able to strike against civilian targets. »

« In addition, we have arrested several thousand individuals who were conducting research into terror tactics, radical ideologies and other suspicious subjects. »

« The PDB will continue monitoring all comms networks, and liaising with local security agencies via the Federal Justice Department. »

Vice President Jerome Archer hailed these results as validation of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, and stated that the PDB will help prevent the mass murder of Federal citizens.

Civil rights groups have claimed that these extremists could have been detected via conventional policing methods, rather than intercepting personal messages. Independent criminologists added that the statistical likelihood of such amateur groups committing actual attacks is low.


* Aegis Appeals For Guardian Artefacts
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Ancient objects left behind by the Guardians have been requested by Aegis for a new anti-xeno research programme.

The Guardians were an intelligent humanoid species whose civilisation collapsed over a million years ago, and who were engaged in hostilities with the Thargoid race.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis Research, gave this statement:

« At the Galactic Summit, Aegis agreed to undertake a fresh analysis of Guardian technology. The hope is that this will lead to the development of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require new samples to compare with Ram Tah's groundbreaking work on this mysterious species. »

« Guardian artefacts including those previously identified as caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns are needed. These can be unearthed from the ancient ruins scattered across dozens of worlds. »

« I beseech the galactic community to support this project. It is vital that Aegis continues to receive funding, and to achieve this we must push the boundaries of our knowledge even further. »

Pilots are asked to deliver their shipments to Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.


* Archon Delaine Starport Campaign Concludes
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An initiative by the Kumo Crew syndicate to construct new starports for increasing trade has ended successfully.

Pilots delivered large quantities of ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. Bounty vouchers were also offered to protect the shipments during transit.

The Kumo Council has announced that rewards for both traders and bounty hunters are now available from Gabriel Enterprise via its loyal intermediaries, The Razor Whips.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd will now fulfil its contract and construct new Orbis starports. These will be in place on the 29th of April 3307 at the following locations:

Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system

HIP 18390, near the California Nebula

HIP 10792, near the Sothis system

HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula

Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region

A statement from Archon Delaine was published by The Pegasi Sentinel:

« I am pleased to see that our trade routes can now extend into fresh territories. My people will be very grateful, I'm sure. »

« What pleases me less is the huge number of criminal scum that tried to disrupt the project. This has forced me to invent some very creative reprisals, which I look forward to inflicting shortly. »


* Winters Claims Civilian Surveillance is Illegal
Shadow President Felicia Winters has claimed that the Proactive Detection Bureau is unconstitutional as it violates the Federal Accord.

In an address before Congress, she said:

« The Federation's constitution explicitly guarantees citizens the right to data security and privacy. The PDB tramples over this by raiding everyone's personal communications, casting aside decency and dignity so that algorithms can probe into every aspect of our lives. »

« Furthermore, if ACT's hypothesis is correct and the NMLA is using an advanced dark-comms network, then the PDB's existence is baseless and unjustifiable. »

Vice President Jerome Archer responded:

« The Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act is emergency legislation that temporarily suspends constitutional statutes, until we are satisfied that the terrorist threat has been negated. »

« Following the PDB's success in uncovering extremist groups, we are widening the search parameters to include other related criminal activity. »

Opinion polls suggest that a slim majority of Federal citizens accept that some liberties must be sacrificed in return for increased security.

However, according to the civil rights organisation Advocacy, the speed with which the PDB gained access to data hubs suggested that « The infrastructure was already in place \u2013 all the government needed was an opportunity to make it legal. »


* Neo-Marlinists Expose Hadrian Duval as NMLA Leader
Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval of Nova Imperium is the mastermind behind the NMLA, according to classified information leaked from within ACT.

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse published the details on the Rewired network:

« Hadrian Duval: the illegitimate embarrassment of the Imperial Family, or their secret terrorist nemesis? That's the story being told by survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, who gave up their secrets to save their own skins. »

« According to my source, Landgrave Delacroix confessed to ACT that his faction transported enzyme bombs and Nova Imperium assassins to their targets on the direct orders of Hadrian Duval, who promised rewards and political power in return. »

« Delacroix also revealed that Hadrian was converted to Neo-Marlinism a year ago by his consort Astrid Minerva, a top NMLA agent. She convinced him that becoming Emperor would be much easier if all the other Duvals were dead! »

« As for the NMLA's attempt on Hadrian's life last October, that was faked in order to gain the Imperial Family's trust. Just another false flag operation \u2013 which, as we truth-seekers know, can be found everywhere. »

As yet this information has not been verified, and its source remains anonymous. There has been no comment from either ACT or Nova Imperium.


* Galactic Mysteries: The Hesperus
Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency examines the Hesperus megaship and the Dredger Clan that caused its recent discovery.

« When the Adamastor derelict received a strange signal, smart money was on it originating from its sister ship, the Hesperus. Both were owned by Azimuth Biochemicals and had vanished 200 years ago. »

« After a united effort to decode and trace the signal, independent pilots located the Hesperus in an asteroid belt around the second star of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V C2-2 system. Like the Adamastor, it was devoid of life \u2013 but not alone. »

« Alongside it was a dredger, whose proximity had triggered the Hesperus's mayday. This was a rare sighting of a Dredger Clan, one of the nomadic tribes that Gunnarson recently discussed. »

« The Scriveners Clan was originally a fleet of research vessels for a long-forgotten academic consortium. Over centuries they became a self-sufficient society, constantly acquiring materials and information. They're not aggressive, but shun outsiders and jealously guard their 'Knowledge Core'. I'm fascinated by mentions of research-sergeants and lector-generals, suggesting their culture is a merger of scholastic and military. »

« With the Hesperus claimed as salvage by the Scriveners and its drives stripped, all chance of learning more was lost. Luckily, four encoded data files had resisted upload, and a gap in the dredger's antiquated firewalls allowed pilots to hack them. »

« The decrypted logs have now been preserved for posterity in a nearby tourist beacon. They tell a disturbing story of corporate rivalry, murder and revenge, but also leave many unanswered questions... »

« We know that survivors abandoned ship to continue searching for 'alien artefacts'. Did they all die in space or did they find something? What did Azimuth's probes detect back in 3113? And who the hell is 'Salvation', the shadowy figure who contacted pilots to find the Hesperus? »


* Hadrian Duval Refutes NMLA Allegations
ACT has confirmed receiving evidence that NMLA attacks were orchestrated by Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, who immediately denied the claim.

Landgrave Delacroix of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid provided details to ACT that the isolationist group Nova Imperium is at the heart of the NMLA. In response, Hadrian Duval made this statement:

« These accusations are completely false. Our political stance is the exact opposite of Marlinism, since we believe in restoring the Empire's traditions. Nova Imperium forces even fought against the terrorists in Mudhrid, as required by the Treaty of Paresa. »

« As for Lady Astrid being a 'top NMLA agent', my wife has been a loyal Imperial Commander since she first piloted a ship. »

Princess Aisling Duval has publicly decried the allegation and offered support to Hadrian Duval. However, Senator Zemina Torval told the Senate:

« Should we be surprised that an extremist organisation performs extreme acts? That this arrogant boy who declares himself 'Imperator' should turn to violent rebellion once again? Enemies of the Empire must be punished, even those with Duval blood. »

ACT is fully investigating the Landgrave's evidence and has asked for patience, despite urgent demands for action from the Alliance, Empire and Federation.


* Federal Leaders Launch Rival Data Requests
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Data deliveries are required by competing initiatives to increase or decrease civilian surveillance in the Federation.

President Zachary Hudson has asked the public to contribute to making the Proactive Detection Bureau more effective:

« The PDB requires access to lesser-known comms channels where terrorists and criminals lurk. Supplying it with data from multiple sources will allow us to root out more potential threats. »

To counter this campaign, Shadow President Felicia Winters aims to protect personal communications from being intercepted:

« My duty is to help citizens preserve their constitutional right to privacy. If enough data can be gathered for baseline testing, we will distribute legal technology and techniques to secure against government intrusion. »

Both campaigns require deliveries of the following data types: anomalous bulk scan data, exceptional scrambled emission data, specialised legacy firmware and unusual encrypted files.

To support President Hudson, pilots should deliver data to Gresley Dock in the Nanomam system.

To support Shadow President Winters, pilots should deliver data to Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.

Political analysts believe that since Hudson and Winters are organising these projects personally, there may be repercussions for the security and stability of the systems where each has influence.


* Guardian Artefacts Collected for Aegis Project
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Aegis's anti-xeno research programme has launched with the mass delivery of artefacts constructed by the Guardians.

Many ancient caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns were found in the ruins of the mysterious civilisation that collapsed over a million years ago. Pilots then transported these to the Delphi system for analysis.

Professor Alba Tesreau made this announcement:

« Everyone at Aegis is thankful for the impressive effort made by the galactic community. If we can gain new insights into Guardian technology from these samples, then funding and resources for our work may continue. »

Aegis has agreed to pursue the development of weaponry and defences that might prove more effective against the Thargoids. However, as yet the research is in its early stages and there are no signs of imminent breakthroughs.

Pilots who delivered Guardian artefacts can now collect their rewards from Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.


* Kumo Crew Starports Open for Business
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Five new starports constructed by Archon Delaine's recent campaign have now become fully operational.

The Orbis stations, which are run by the Kumo Council faction, are listed below:

Kumo City in the Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14 system (Harma region)

California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system (California Nebula)

Crimson Exchange in the HIP 10792 system (Sothis region)

Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system (Coalsack Nebula)

Delaine Terminus in the Eol Prou PC-K c9-91 system (Colonia region)

The starports will provide a full range of services, although their low populations bring concerns that they may be under-staffed. Additionally, security agencies in nearby systems expressed fears that since they are operated by the Kumo Crew syndicate, they are likely to harbour black markets and promote illegal activity.

Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, a senior member of the Kumo Council, addressed this when she told The Pegasi Sentinel:

« These starports exist solely to encourage trade, which is the lifeblood of our galaxy. Sometimes a little lifeblood can get spilled here and there, so I'm sure our new neighbours will welcome our protection, yes? »

Other factions have appeared in the five systems, including subsidiaries of Sirius Corporation. Several newsfeeds have speculated about an ambiguous connection between the syndicate and the megacorp, whose financial support might explain how the Kumo Crew managed to extend so far beyond its territory.


* Nova Imperium Targeted by Superpowers
The isolationist group faces attack by both Federal and Imperial factions, after accusations that Imperator Hadrian Duval is the NMLA mastermind.

The League of Mandu arrived in the Paresa system last week and quickly established a foothold. Admiral Natalia Lee, commanding the Harmony's Shield megaship, announced:

« Our purpose is to eliminate the terrorists who slaughtered so many Federal citizens. We advise the Empire to stand aside and allow us to deliver justice. »

Magister Julius Halstrom of the Peraesii Empire Consulate declared:

« In the name of the Emperor, we stand ready to purge the NMLA from the Paresa system \u2013 and the Federation too, unless they withdraw. »

Hadrian Duval has broadcast a message via Paresa News Network:

« The NMLA faked my identity when dealing with the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, knowing the superpowers would do their work for them by killing another Duval. Nova Imperium will defend itself if necessary, but we are not responsible for any terrorist attacks. »

ACT is still attempting to corroborate evidence provided by the Landgrave of Mudhrid. Praetor Leo Magnus, Nova Imperium's security chief, is reportedly aiding their enquiries.

The Senate has urgently requested direction from the Emperor, but Chancellor Blaine declared « Her Majesty cannot pass judgement upon a live investigation. »


* Federation Attacks Nova Imperium
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Open warfare has begun in the Paresa system between Nova Imperium and the League of Mandu, a Federal faction.

Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has been accused of masterminding the NMLA starport bombings, according to evidence provided to ACT.

Admiral Natalia Lee, commanding the Harmony's Shield megaship, declared:

« The Empire refuses to arrest a Duval, even when he and his organisation are brutal terrorists. In the name of the hundreds of thousands of Federal citizens they murdered, we will enact justice. »

Hadrian Duval made an announcement from Dyson City, the home station of Nova Imperium:

« This invasion of Imperial space is based on false information. The Federation does not have the right to act as our judge, jury and executioner. I call upon the Empire to come to our defence, as stipulated in the Treaty of Paresa. »

Nova Imperium is an isolationist group that believes in retaining Imperial traditions and severing all ties with other superpowers. Hadrian Duval is the illegitimate grandson of Emperor Hengist, whose heritage was officially acknowledged last November.

ACT is currently working to verify claims that the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid aided the NMLA on Imperator Duval's instructions.


* Hudson Initiative Increases Federal Surveillance
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

President Zachary Hudson's call for data deliveries has enhanced civilian surveillance within the Federation.

His campaign received more data than a competing request from Shadow President Felicia Winters, which aimed to offer ways of protecting communications against interception by the Proactive Detection Bureau.

For both initiatives, pilots delivered anomalous bulk scan data, exceptional scrambled emission data, specialised legacy firmware and unusual encrypted files.

President Zachary Hudson hailed this show of public support for the Federal government:

« Our citizens deserve security, and with their contributions to the PDB's databases, we are now in a better position to protect them against terrorism. »

Analysts predict that this outcome will boost security for systems that fall within Hudson's personal sphere of influence. It is also expected that a loss of public support will reduce stability within systems where Winters has authority.

Pilots who supported President Hudson can now collect their rewards from Gresley Dock in the Nanomam system.

Pilots who supported Shadow President Winters can now collect their rewards from Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.


* The Voice of 'Salvation'
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The enigmatic 'Salvation' has sent a message to the Commanders he recently recruited to discover the Hesperus megaship.

The vessel was found in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V C2-2 system, after 'Salvation' provided an access key to read its automated SOS. Pilots were then encouraged to deliver any surviving logs to Taurus Mining Ventures at the Hind Mine asteroid base in the T Tauri system.

Patience Middleton, a representative of the corporation, announced:

« 'Salvation' has authorised us to offer two million credits or ten units of void opals for delivering the Hesperus's logs. This contract ends on the 21st of May 3307, after which payments will not be available. »

« We have been asked to relay the message below. »

« 'This is Salvation. I call myself this as I cannot yet reveal my identity, but my scientific breakthroughs will literally save all of humanity. The Adamastor and the Hesperus were just the beginning, as I have always known. For my intrepid agents, there will be further work to come.' »

Little is known about Taurus Mining Ventures, and 'Salvation' remains anonymous. Commanders are therefore being cautioned against undertaking tasks for a potentially criminal organisation.


* Alliance Election Campaigns Resume
The election of the Alliance prime minister will take place on the 27th of May, having been postponed due to the Galactic Summit.

Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported:

« Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's decision to postpone the election for three months caused enormous disruption and mass protests. This may have mortally wounded his campaign to be re-elected as head of government for a second six-year term. »

« With hindsight it's clear that Mahon was prioritising the Sirius Treaty, a detailed proposal to unite the superpowers against the Thargoids. Unfortunately, the Galactic Summit was prematurely halted by the 'Nine Martyrs' bombings before the treaty could be agreed. »

« Although there are several candidates, Mahon's only serious challenger is Councillor Nakato Kaine. She has been a vocal critic of his expansionist policies, and gained much public support for her focus on boosting trade between Alliance systems. »

« Electoral votes will be cast by members of the Alliance Assembly, whose decisions reflect popular opinion in their constituencies. No previous prime minister has served more than a single term, so it remains to be seen whether Mahon will defy precedent or Kaine will follow the pattern of history. »


* Paresa Conflict Risks War Between Superpowers
There are widespread fears that current hostilities in the Paresa system may force the Empire and Federation to declare full-scale war.

The situation has been covered by mainstream media.

The Imperial Herald: « Hadrian might be the black sheep of the Duval family, but should he die by Federation hands, honour would demand retribution. Already the Imperial Navy is mobilising in anticipation of the Emperor's reaction. »

The Federal Times: « The evidence that Nova Imperium orchestrated the starport bombings is credible, but the possibility of subterfuge remains. Could the NMLA really fake so many orders from Hadrian Duval to such a believable standard? »

Eye on Achenar: « An attack against a Duval is an attack against us all, even if he does turn out to be a terrorist. How dare those Fednecks try to judge our criminals for us! »

Sol Today: « Hundreds of thousands dead, half a million wounded\u2026 our people deserve retribution. But as usual, all the Imposers care about is pandering to their monarchy. »

Paresa News Network: « The death toll is soaring as full-blown battles rage through our system. Paresans are terrified at facing conquest by the Federation. Can we rely on the Empire to save us? »


* Mass Thargoid Strike \u2013 Emergency Declared
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Thargoid forces have invaded the Delphi system and several systems in the California, Coalsack and Pleiades Nebulas.

Huge numbers of Thargoid scouts and interceptors have appeared within multiple systems. Aegis has mobilised available defences, but also requested assistance from anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots in combating the Thargoids.

Shipments of Guardian artefacts were recently delivered to the Delphi system as part of an Aegis research programme. Professor Alba Tesreau has speculated that the Thargoids' well-documented aversion to Guardian technology may be the reason why Delphi was targeted.

Two starports recently constructed by the Kumo Crew syndicate \u2013 California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system and Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system \u2013 are among those seriously damaged by the assault. Archon Delaine, the syndicate's warlord, announced:

« I'm not going to let these filthy aliens tear down what we've only just built. We need to teach them a lesson that even they will understand! »

All attacked stations have called upon the galactic community for help with rescuing their populations.


* Nova Imperium Triumphs Over Federation
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The conflict in the Paresa system has ended with Nova Imperium defeating the Federal-backed League of Mandu faction.

Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval had been targeted following accusations that he controlled the NMLA paramilitary group. He delivered a public address:

« Our hard-earned victory brings great honour to all who fought against the Federation's invasion. Their arrogance justifies our long-held belief that the Empire must stand apart from other superpowers, but Nova Imperium will continue to serve in the fight against terrorism. Memento Mordanticus! »

Ambassador Catherine Carlisle of the Federal Diplomatic Corps made this statement:

« Although we are grateful for their zeal in combatting the NMLA, our intermediaries at the League of Mandu have acted hastily and will soon depart from Imperial space. »

Pilots who fought for Nova Imperium can now collect their rewards from Dyson City in the Paresa system.

Pilots who fought for the League of Mandu can now collect their rewards from Harmony's Shield in the Paresa system.


* Federal Citizens Approve Government Scrutiny
The Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all civil communications in the Federation, has received a boost from the galactic community.

President Hudson's campaign for additional data proved so successful that the PDB has dramatically increased the range of its surveillance.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the Federal Intelligence Agency announced:

« We are now able to discreetly scan almost every private and public communications network used within Federal systems. As a result, arrest rates have soared and several organised crime rings have been dismantled. »

Shadow President Winters's efforts to distribute methods of blocking the PDB received considerable support, but failed to eclipse Hudson's initiative. This was interpreted by the Federal government as a mandate from the citizens to continue its surveillance programme.

Rhiannon Grady, director of the civil rights organisation Advocacy, told the media:

« Since the vast majority of citizens will never receive a visit from the FIA for their activities, the public has no sense of what they have lost. But history teaches us how hard it is to regain freedoms once you've given them away. The Federation has taken a large step toward becoming an interstellar police state with little regard for the individual. »


* Alliance Unrest as Mahon and Kaine Clash
The front-runner candidates in the Alliance election have stepped up their campaigns, amid widespread political and civil unrest.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine are touring across the Alliance, gathering public support to sway the Assembly when it votes on the 27th of May.

Attending a business sector conference on the planet Industry in the Zaonce system, Prime Minister Mahon stated:

« We've heard a lot of reactionary rhetoric from Councillor Kaine, but it's much easier to be critical than constructive. She has done little to secure the prosperity of our people and companies, which was my primary focus over the last six years. »

At a protest march on New Caledonia in the Alkaid system, Councillor Kaine addressed the crowd:

« Again, the Thargoids lash out at our presence. Again, we prop up the other superpowers. Again, we pump money into Aegis and Lakon but not our own economies. Nothing changes, unless Mahon is voted out and the Alliance takes a new direction! »

Opinion polls suggest that Mahon has retained majority support, but with a narrower margin than in February when the election was originally scheduled. Many agree with Kaine that the Alliance should not have participated in the Galactic Summit, which led to the 'Nine Martyrs' bombings.


* Alliance Election Candidates Announce Community Drives
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine have launched rival delivery initiatives in Alliance space.

The two leading candidates for Alliance prime minister are attempting to gather public support, although the actual election will be determined by votes within the Assembly on the 27th of May.

Every opinion poll suggests that Mahon's victory is all but confirmed, which will grant him a second six-year term. However, the outcomes of these community drives will directly affect the successful candidate's policies once in office.

Prime Minister Mahon is focusing on increasing industrial materials to aid expansion. He has requested that shipments of ceramic composites, polymers and superconductors are delivered to Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.

Councillor Kaine aims to support local manufacturers in order to boost trade. She has asked for supplies of copper, micro-controllers and polymers to be delivered to Brett High in the Tionisla system.

Whoever is most successful will run a second campaign the following week. Mahon will launch a tritium mining initiative, leading to the construction of new Alliance starports. Kaine will use void opal mining to help stimulate trade, increasing the availability of rare goods in Alliance-controlled systems.


* Hadrian Duval Allegations Declared 'Inconclusive'
Evidence that Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval masterminded the NMLA terror campaign cannot be authenticated, according to ACT.

Inspector Mara Klatt, one of ACT's joint leaders, delivered this report:

« We have rigorously analysed data provided by the Landgrave of Mudhrid that contains detailed instructions from Hadrian Duval. The content undoubtedly arranges the starport bombings, but its source is inconclusive. It now seems highly plausible that his identity was faked by the NMLA. »

Hadrian Duval made an announcement via the Paresa News Network:

« There can no longer be any doubt that the NMLA planted a false trail in order to incriminate us. They aim to slay every Duval and demolish Imperial traditions, a goal that the Federation is clearly happy to support. »

« Lady Astrid and I are deeply grateful to the Nova Navy, and all the other pilots who helped to defend our honour. »

The Federal Diplomatic Corps confirmed that the League of Mandu, which was defeated by Nova Imperium, will withdraw from the Paresa system but made no reference to ACT's report.

Praetor Leo Magnus, head of security for Nova Imperium and a former IISS officer, has been seconded to ACT. He will serve as a replacement for the deceased Captain Niamh Seutonia.


* Thargoids Pursue Aegis Megaship
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Alexandria megaship has jumped from Delphi to the HIP 16538 system, triggering a Thargoid attack.

The megaship is carrying large quantities of Guardian artefacts, which were delivered as part of a research programme by Aegis.

Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, has broadcast an SOS:

« This is an emergency! We scheduled a stopover in HIP 16538 for tritium refuelling en route to the Sol system, but Thargoid interceptors came swarming in within minutes. We require immediate assistance! »

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, announced:

« We believe that the Thargoids are reacting to the concentrated presence of Guardian technology stored within the Alexandria's cargo holds. Not only has the attack placed its crew and the population of this system in danger, but we risk losing these extremely valuable research materials. »

« Aegis is asking anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots to help destroy all Thargoid vessels within HIP 16538 and protect the Alexandria. »


* The Fall of The Oracle
The Oracle starport in the Delphi system began tumbling out of orbit following a recent Thargoid attack.

The station was already ablaze and severely damaged by caustic enzymes during a Thargoid incursion in the Delphi system. This led to a cascading systems failure that shut down all of the station's alignment thrusters.

As a result, the entire starport became affected by the gravity of Delphi 5 a, and began falling toward the moon. This immediately endangered the lives of tens of thousands of civilians.

Due to fire damage in the docking bay and the narrow timescale, evacuation of The Oracle's entire population before it impacted upon the surface was considered impossible.

With only hours to go before collision, independent pilots risked their lives to rescue thousands of trapped civilians from the falling and damaged starport. This allowed the engineers to focus on patching up The Oracle's alignment systems. The station is now considered to be in a stable orbit.

A spokesperson for Sirius Inc told the media:

« We are immensely grateful to those courageous Commanders for helping to prevent what could have been one of the most horrific disasters in modern history. »

Similar incidents have been reported at other stations that were targeted by the Thargoids, leading to speculation that this may not be coincidental. Unilateral plans to shore up this vulnerability in the starports are now underway.


* Federation Refuses Entry to 'Plague Ship'
The Alexandria megaship has been warned that it faces destruction if it attempts to travel to any Federal system.

The Aegis-owned vessel triggered a full-scale Thargoid incursion when it arrived in the HIP 16538 system. This seemed to be a reaction to the huge quantities of Guardian artefacts currently stored within its cargo holds.

Captain Jacob Morales, the Alexandria's commander, broadcast this message:

« The Federal Navy has instructed us not to resume our scheduled journey to Sol or enter any system within the Federation. They're treating us like a plague ship! I understand their concern that more Thargoids will follow us, but we have several thousand crewmembers who need to reach safe harbour. »

A strategy was outlined by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis:

« We are attempting to clear the HIP 16538 system of Thargoid vessels, greatly aided by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. The megaship will then jump to a system with a minimal population, where we will offload its cargo. »

Aegis has reiterated that the option to jettison the Alexandria's cargo is a last resort, since the Guardian artefacts are vital to its research programme and cost billions of credits to acquire.


* Tritium Mining Marks Alliance Election Day
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

As the Assembly votes for its new leader, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has requested mined tritium to aid expansion.

The new initiative follows on from his successful drive for industrial materials, which resulted in large amounts of ceramic composites, polymers and superconductors. Pilots who contributed to this can now collect their rewards from Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.

A competing community drive by Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon's main rival in the election, brought deliveries of copper, micro-controllers and polymers.

Prime Minister Mahon's new tritium mining initiative aims to provide a stockpile of fuel to support the Alliance's expansion programme. This will involve constructing up to five new starports, which are expected to be operational within a month.

Mined deposits of tritium can be delivered to Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.

Members of the Alliance Assembly will gather today to cast their votes for a new prime minister. Opinion polls believe Mahon will comfortably win, although acknowledge that Kaine has broad support. The successful candidate will serve as the Alliance head of state for a six-year term.


* Mahon Wins Alliance Election
The election for Alliance prime minister has been won by the incumbent Edmund Mahon, who begins a second six-year term in office.

The Alliance Assembly voted yesterday to elect the new head of state. Mahon received more votes than any other candidate, albeit not a majority of the electorate. Some council members demanded additional checks, causing a delay in announcing the results.

Prime Minister Mahon gave a victory speech to the public:

« It is my great honour to continue serving the diverse peoples of the Alliance. We will hold fast to our principles of democracy, prosperity and mutual defence, no matter what the galaxy throws at us. »

Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, observed:

« With the core systems affected by political unrest, terrorist threats and economic turmoil, it is no surprise that the Assembly voted for stability. Mahon is a known quantity, and the Alliance has become reliant on his calm, measured leadership. »


* Jupiter Division Inspires Corporatist Movement
The Core Dynamics breakaway faction created by ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester has survived, by gathering believers in the corporate rule of the Federation.

Conrad Sterling, political journalist for Vox Galactica, published this report:

« With its military forces defeated in February, and its leader found guilty of mass murder and imprisoned for life, Jupiter Division should now be a footnote in the Federation's history. »

« Yet in recent months it has steadily grown, retaking control of HIP 54530 and several neighbouring systems. Its megaship, Victory's Forge, even managed to repel Federal troops and remains under Jupiter Division's command. »

« There is much speculation about the underlying reasons for this. Alongside general unrest with the Federation's current policies, there is a rising interest in Rochester's grand vision \u2013 replacing democracy with corporatocracy \u2013 among those wishing to see change. Many have flocked to Jupiter Division's banner, preventing its collapse. »

« Core Dynamics, its parent company, has also continued to see defections within its ranks. However, new CEO Owen McKenna has vowed to destroy his predecessor's rogue department. It is possible that Jupiter Division's survival was only a brief reprieve, unless the corporatists can gather in sufficient numbers to sustain it. »


* Aegis Megaship Prepares to Escape Thargoids
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

All independent ships aboard the Alexandria in the HIP 16538 system will be undocked on Thursday the 3rd of June.

The megaship triggered an invasion of Thargoid vessels when it arrived from the Delphi system. Aegis believes this was a reaction to the large quantities of Guardian artefacts being stored in its cargo holds.

Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, outlined the next steps:

« On Thursday we will make a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system. Since this has a small population, the risk of casualties will be low if the Thargoids continue to pursue us. Once there, we will arrange to offload our cargo and distribute it to multiple locations. »

« As a precaution, shortly before the jump we will uncouple all independent ships and leave them in the HIP 16538 system. We advise all pilots currently docked with the Alexandria to depart as soon as possible. »

The Alexandria was ordered not to enter any Federal systems, causing many newsfeeds to refer to it as a 'plague ship'. There are widespread concerns that it will attract Thargoids to any system it travels to.


* Core Dynamics Engages Jupiter Division in Battle
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The corporate faction Jupiter Division is fighting for survival against the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system.

Jupiter Division was formed by rogue Core Dynamics departments loyal to ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester. Although it was defeated in February, a growing corporatist movement within the Federation has helped rebuild its strength.

A call to arms was made by Owen McKenna, the new CEO of Core Dynamics:

« Rochester's deranged cult must be wiped out once and for all. We are supporting our ally, the Silver Legal Group, to destroy Jupiter Division's fleet and allow us to retake our stolen resources. »

Vice-Executive Blanca Carbonell, a senior leader of Jupiter Division, broadcast this message:

« To all those seeking a better Federation \u2013 stand up and make your voice heard! Only direct corporate rule can end government corruption. Jupiter Division must survive to lead that change! »

Two megaships, Victory's Forge and Iron Wings of Justice, are once again serving as the centres of operation for Jupiter Division and the Silver Legal Group.

Political commentators believe that this second conflict will be a decisive one, determining whether or not Jupiter Division can survive without its founder.


* Tritium Mining Campaign Boosts Alliance Expansion
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's request for mined tritium has concluded, paving the way for new Alliance starports.

Large quantities of tritium were delivered, which will provide fuel for a civil infrastructure programme designed to increase the Alliance's presence.

As part of this expansion, new Alliance starports will be constructed in these systems by the 25th of June 3307:

LHS 2522

Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19

Prime Minister Mahon, who was recently re-elected by the Assembly, told the media:

« The economy of the Alliance will benefit greatly from investment in expansion. These new stations will provide more opportunities for individuals and corporations alike. »

Pilots who mined and delivered tritium can now collect their rewards from Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.


* Aegis Megaship Vanishes in Hyperspace
The Alexandria has failed to arrive in the HIP 30944 system as scheduled, and may have been hyperdicted by the Thargoids.

The Aegis-owned megaship triggered an attack by Thargoid vessels when it travelled from the Delphi system to HIP 16538 on the 20th of May. Aegis believes this was caused by the large quantity of Guardian artefacts in its cargo holds.

To reduce the risk of further casualties, the Alexandria plotted a route to a low-population prison colony in the HIP 30944 system. All independent ships were undocked before it made the hyperspace jump on the 3rd of June.

However, the megaship never reached its arrival point and all communication with it has ceased. Search teams in local systems have not detected its presence.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis, informed the media:

« We regret to announce a complete loss of contact with the Alexandria. Although there is no evidence of damage or destruction, its disappearance while travelling through hyperspace raises the possibility that it was intercepted en route by Thargoid forces. »

« Captain Jacob Morales and over four thousand crewmembers will be listed as missing presumed dead. In addition to this great tragedy, Aegis's research programme into Guardian technology has been severely impacted by the loss of many precious artefacts. »


* Neo-Marlinist Political Party Emerges
Minister Aaron Whyte, leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, has confirmed that it aims to politically represent the Neo-Marlinist fringe.

At a meeting of the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Whyte declared:

« Not all of the Neo-Marlinist community seek a violent uprising to end the Duval family's thousand-year dictatorship. We can help replace desperate acts of rebellion with meaningful dialogue and public pressure. »

Several newsfeeds observed that Whyte was attempting to rebrand Neo-Marlinism as being closer to the mainstream ideals of Marlinism. However, the possibility that the faction may now act as the political wing of the NMLA has caused widespread alarm.

In related news, a recent election in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system saw voters remove the Marlinism Reformation Party from power, after it granted asylum to survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

The system's new leader, Minister Octavia Volkov of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine, announced:

« My party believes in following Marlin Duval's example by building independent democracies, rather than reforming the Empire. However, three of our colony systems have already fallen under the control of foreign factions. We urgently need support to keep the dream of a Marlinist Republic alive. »


* Core Dynamics Triumphs Against Jupiter Division
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The corporate faction Jupiter Division has been defeated by the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system.

The breakaway faction from Core Dynamics was unable to resist efforts by its parent company to recover ships and resources. Jupiter Division will soon be subsumed by Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics.

Owen McKenna, the CEO of Core Dynamics, declared:

« Thanks to the Silver Legal Group and other loyal allies of the Federation, we have finally crushed this criminal enterprise. Let this be an end to the delusions of Jupiter Rochester. »

Many newsfeeds believe that Jupiter Division's defeat will have a negative impact on the corporatist movement that has recently emerged within some Federal systems.

Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group confirmed that those who fought on their side can now collect payments from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.


* The Legacy of the Hesperus
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Commanders in the Chukchan and Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 systems have reported being contacted by 'Salvation'.

The anonymous individual is known to have an interest in the Adamastor and the Hesperus, the 'ghost ships' within those systems. Both of the derelict megaships were operated 200 years ago by Azimuth Biochemicals.

Commander Tyler Thorsen told Vox Galactica:

« I was taking some sightseers on a trip round the Hesperus, and getting as close as I dared to the Scriveners Clan dredger. I scanned the tourist beacon for them, and suddenly received a direct message from this 'Salvation' guy. »

« He asked me to track down some old signal beacons, which are listening posts configured to retransmit long-range comms. Apparently these could help locate the survivors from the megaship. But the Hesperus is ancient history. Surely there can't be anything or anyone left to find? »

In April, 'Salvation' unofficially recruited independent pilots to locate the Hesperus, and to deliver its surviving logs to Taurus Mining Ventures.

The Pilots Federation is running an inquiry into 'Salvation' and his associates. Commanders are being cautioned against undertaking tasks for what may be an illegal enterprise.


* ACT Continues to Hunt NMLA Terrorists
The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has published an update on its investigation into the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of ACT's joint leaders, gave a statement to the media:

« ACT is currently pursuing multiple lines of enquiry, which must remain classified for reasons of security. Our agents are gathering evidence from sites across the Alliance, Empire and Federation. »

« As yet we cannot report any significant breakthroughs. NMLA activists appear to use a dark-comms network that defies detection. They also compartmentalise their operations, so individual cells have little knowledge of each other. »

« In recent months, NMLA incidents have been restricted to minor strikes against Imperial authorities, which were dealt with by local police forces. There has been no activity by Theta Group, the hardcore extremists responsible for the 'Nine Martyrs' starport bombings. »

« The collapse of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid may have deprived the NMLA of their logistical capability to deliver large-scale attacks. But it remains possible that a new wave of terrorist atrocities is being planned. »

ACT later confirmed that it has recruited additional personnel from Alliance Interpol, the Federal Intelligence Agency, the Imperial Internal Security Service, the Marlinist Constabulary, Nova Imperium's Praetorian Guard and the Wallglass Investigations Agency.


* Sirius Corporation: The Fourth Superpower?
The galaxy's largest megacorporation is continuing to influence the political arena and affect billions of lives.

A review was published by Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica:

« With its own government, laws and naval fleet, it's not surprising that Sirius Corporation is occasionally referred to as 'the fourth superpower'. That now seems to be its actual goal, as its impact upon interstellar politics increases. »

« When Sirius Corporation resettled the Marlinist refugees in their own colony systems, it averted war between the Empire and the Federation. But this seemingly altruistic move enabled CEO Li Yong-Rui to claim political neutrality, gaining public support to host the Galactic Summit in the Sirius system. »

« That success was undermined by the controversy of granting diplomatic status to pirate warlord Archon Delaine. Rumours of secret business dealings were reinforced when Sirius subsidiaries appeared alongside the Kumo Crew's new starports. »

« High-level agreements were also made with the Alliance, with Sirius Atmospherics aiding colonisation of the Coalsack Nebula. But some believe that its project to terraform ammonia worlds brought retaliatory strikes from the Thargoids and enormous casualties. »

« The latest news is of a collaboration with technology brokers to make a previously limited ship module commercially available. Is this a shrewd business decision, or part of Sirius Corporation's strategy of political dominance? »


* Electoral Reform Proposed for the Alliance
Councillor Nakato Kaine has suggested that the Alliance's current electoral system should be replaced by direct public voting.

The proposal follows a recent election where Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was reinstated for a second six-year term.

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, Councillor Kaine said:

« Only allowing council members to choose the prime minister is a flawed system, vulnerable to corruption and outside influence. The people of the Alliance should have a direct mandate to determine their leader by casting individual votes. »

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

« Although Kaine stopped short of claiming that Mahon's victory was achieved fraudulently, the Assembly took a dim view of this attempt at electoral overhaul. Some council members accused her of failing to accept that her policies received considerably less support than those of her rival. »

« Despite this, a few accepted that there could be merit in such a restructure. However, organising public voting across all Alliance systems would be much harder than in democracies with a more established infrastructure, such as the Federation, or that have smaller populations, such as the Marlinist Colonies. »


* Materials Needed for Enhanced Ship Module
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has requested commodities to make a fully engineered detailed surface scanner commercially available.

The ship module was produced in limited numbers during a terraforming programme campaign by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306. It was awarded to pilots who provided data on worlds with ammonia-based atmospheres for its terraforming programme.

Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation, provided details:

« Following a feasibility study, we have determined that this module can be economically mass produced for general sale. Our fully engineered detailed surface scanner has twice probe coverage, allowing planets and moons to be mapped more efficiently. »

« In order to begin production, we require large quantities of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents. We will generously reward pilots who can deliver these to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system. »

The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 will be available for purchase at all human technology brokers, assuming that sufficient quantities of commodities can be obtained.


* Guardian-Thargoid Battlefield Discovered
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An Anaconda from the Hesperus megaship has been found at a historical battlefield on the moon Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a.

The discovery was made by pilots who tracked down a series of signal beacons, following instructions provided by the anonymous 'Salvation'. The beacons were deployed by the Hesperus during its voyage nearly 200 years ago.

The Anaconda, named Proteus, was one of the megaship's secondary vessels and had been outfitted for long-range exploration. It was used by an Azimuth Biochemicals science team to flee the Hesperus after the megaship was overtaken by saboteurs from rival company Pharmasapien.

Upon landing, the Proteus was converted into a research facility to study the ancient structures and wreckage on the moon. The proximity of both Guardian and Thargoid technology suggests this was the site of a battle fought by the two civilisations over a million years ago, although in 3113 neither species had yet been identified.

Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research gave this statement:

« This is a significant xenoarchaeological find \u2013 physical evidence of the war between the Guardians and the Thargoids. Our advance teams are conducting preliminary surveys, and a megaship is being prepared. Following the Alexandria's tragic disappearance, we hope this may serve as a fresh source of Guardian artefacts for our anti-xeno research programme. »


* Corporatists Stalled by Jupiter Division's Defeat
The fall of Jupiter Division has undermined the popular movement calling for the Federation to be governed by corporations.

Conrad Sterling, political journalist for Vox Galactica, reported on developments:

« Core Dynamics's recent victory in the Ts'ao Tach system dealt a severe blow to the corporatists. Many companies withdrew their support even before the last shot was fired, and plans for Jupiter Division to become the movement's central organisation have been abandoned. »

« Sighs of relief were undoubtedly breathed through the corridors of power on Mars when this threat to the Federation's democratic principles was defeated. And yet, despite Congress downplaying it and many Federal newsfeeds neglecting to cover the story, calls for a corporatocracy have not been completely silenced. »

« Citizens who seek an alternative to voting for either Hudson or Winters are still attracted to the idea. Would corporate rule be more honest? Opinions vary, but many supporters claim 'big business' already possesses true power behind closed doors. »

« It now seems that history will record this as a path not taken. With Jupiter Rochester imprisoned and Jupiter Division dissolved, replacement figureheads for the corporatist movement are unlikely to arise in time to preserve it. »


* NMLA Makes Political Overtures
The Marlinism Reformation Party, which now represents the Neo-Marlinist fringe, has suggested a peace deal between the NMLA and the Empire.

Minister Aaron Whyte explained the proposal during a session of the Marlinist Parliament:

« Via anonymous intermediaries, we have received assurances that the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is keen to take advantage of our representation. I see this as a hugely positive step that will prevent further conflict. »

« In essence, the NMLA is offering reparations for the unfortunate casualties of its anti-authority activities within the Empire. In return, it requests a permanent presence in the Imperial Senate as a means of continuing political dialogue. »

Many other parliamentarians considered the proposal to be highly controversial. Minister Octavia Volkov declared:

« Providing the NMLA with a political wing, pretending they are reasonable people, suggesting they could pay off the families of everyone they've murdered\u2026 Whyte, you are an insult not just to Marlinism but to all humanity! »

First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for unity, insisting that the Marlinist Colonies must stand together to ensure their survival. However, she has officially requested that the Marlinism Reformation Party reverses its stance on negotiating with the NMLA.


* Detailed Surface Scanner Campaign Reaches Target
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Pilots have delivered commodities to enable Sirius Corporation to mass produce a fully engineered detailed surface scanner.

The enhanced ship module will shortly receive a commercial release, having previously only been available during a terraforming initiative by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306.

The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 increases probe coverage to twice the normally achievable range, offering a more efficient mapping of planetary surfaces.

The project's success was declared by Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation:

« We are most grateful to all pilots who brought us shipments of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents as requested. Mass production of the enhanced detailed surface scanner has already begun, and it will be available for purchase from human technology brokers very soon. »

All pilots who took part in this campaign can now collect payment from Sirius Corporation at Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system.


* Aegis and 'Salvation' Compete for Guardian Artefacts
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures have requested deliveries of Guardian artefacts to the PMD2009 48 system.

Their rival campaigns follow the discovery of an ancient battleground between the Guardians and the Thargoids on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a.

Patience Middleton, representing Taurus Mining Ventures, broadcast this statement:

« 'Salvation' has claimed the exclusive rights to exploit the Proteus site, which was only discovered because of his specialist knowledge. He has contracted us to pay for Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns brought to the Glorious Prospect megaship. »

Aegis Research has also positioned a megaship, the Archimedes, in the PMD2009 48 system. Professor Alba Tesreau announced:

« It is vital that Aegis replaces the Guardian artefacts that were lost aboard the Alexandria. Without sufficient materials, our anti-xeno research programme will be severely hampered. »

« We recognise the risk that collecting Guardian technology on a megaship may attract the Thargoids, as happened in the Delphi system. However, this system is much farther from any known areas of Thargoid activity, so we hope to avoid drawing their attention. »

The Alliance, Empire and Federation consider depriving Aegis of resources to be a criminal act. As a result, pilots are warned that any ship modules received from Taurus Mining Ventures will be marked as 'hot', thereby incurring extra costs to be cleaned prior to installation.


* New Alliance Starports Become Operational
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Two Alliance stations have been constructed following a successful re-election campaign by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon.

Enterprise Market in the LHS 2522 system and Prosperity Core in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system are now fully operational. Prime Minister Mahon welcomed visitors to the new starports, promising that they would « further enhance the Alliance's commitment to creating opportunities ».

However, Councillor Nakato Kaine triggered heated debate in the Alliance Assembly when she made this announcement:

« My investigation turned up irregularities in the tritium mining campaign, suggesting that it only received enough deliveries to allow one starport to be built. Furthermore, docking records seem to indicate that Sirius Corporation made up the shortfall with a number of unregistered donations. »

« Sirius Corporation now has a presence in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system. This suggests disturbing parallels with the company's recent dealings to help build Archon Delaine's new starports. The question is \u2013 what did Mahon promise in return? »

A statement from the Office of the Prime Minister clarified that Sirius Corporation was one of many companies currently partnered with the Alliance to support its expansion programme. It did not address the discrepancy in tritium deliveries or refer to any contributions from the megacorp.


* Imperial Senate Considers Marlinist Diplomacy
A proposal for the Empire to formally open diplomatic relations with the Marlinist Colonies has been made by Senator Lorcan Scordato.

The eight systems are populated by ex-Imperial citizens who fled to avoid persecution for their beliefs in Marlinism, which advocates democratic representation.

Returning from a fact-finding mission to the colonies, Senator Scordato told the Senate:

« The Marlinist community is primarily focused on peaceful co-existence alongside the Empire, rather than trying to reform the Republic of Achenar. And now that Minister Aaron Whyte speaks for the Neo-Marlinists, we have an opportunity to prevent further extremist actions via diplomacy. »

Although some senators agreed, others such as Denton Patreus stressed that « As a matter of honour and principle, the Empire does not negotiate with terrorists. »

Several newsfeeds observed that both the Alliance and the Federation are looking into opening formal diplomatic channels with the Marlinist Colonies. Similar debates have occurred in the Assembly and Congress regarding the acceptance of an NMLA political wing.

First Minister Jenna Fairfax has repeated calls for the Marlinism Reformation Party to cease representing the Neo-Marlinist fringe. However, she also announced plans for a Marlinist equivalent to the Imperial Diplomatic Corps that would undertake ambassadorial duties.


* Four Federal Systems Declare Independence
The Azaladshu Free faction, which controls four systems, has seceded from the Federation in protest against civilian surveillance.

The unexpected declaration followed the election of new leadership for Azaladshu Free, which currently controls the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems.

Mayor Constanza Noguera announced:

« The Federation has become corrupt, authoritarian and untrustworthy. In particular, the public surveillance laws to spy on innocent people cannot be tolerated. From now on, we will govern our systems as independent sovereign nations. »

Political observers believe that several other Federal factions are also planning to declare independence. All are within Shadow President Felicia Winters's sphere of influence, although she has publicly renounced any support of these actions.

Congress has stated that secession is illegal under the Federal Accord, and ordered Azaladshu Free to revert to normal membership status. The Federal Navy and other military organisations have been placed on alert.

President Hudson has reacted strongly, stating that « This degree of organised criminal behaviour only proves that the Proactive Detection Bureau is needed to maintain order. »

Shadow President Winters countered by claiming « Removing our citizens' right to privacy is the cause of this rebellion, not the solution. »


* Federation Battles Independents in the Azaladshu System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Conflict has erupted between the Azaladshu Free and Neche Inc factions, as multiple Federal systems declare independence.

This was sparked by Azaladshu Free withdrawing from the Federation, which transformed Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 into independent systems. The faction strenuously opposes government monitoring of Federal citizens' private communications.

Three other Federal factions are on the verge of declaring independence: Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour. All are closely monitoring the situation in Azaladshu and considering their next move.

Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, made this statement:

« We refuse to accept the Federation's draconian surveillance laws. I call upon all supporters of independence to help us fight for our sovereignty! »

The declaration brought a swift reaction from President Zachary Hudson:

« As Azaladshu Free has violated the Federal Accord, I have no option but to order Neche Inc to engage with these criminals. Thanks to advance intelligence on the secession, we were able to establish the megaship Fortress Liberty in the system to help retake it for the Federation. »

In Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters faced criticism for allowing the secession to occur within her sphere of influence. She reiterated that she does not support rebellion, but does consider the Proactive Detection Bureau to be unconstitutional.


* 'Salvation' Eclipses Aegis to Obtain Guardian Artefacts
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Rival delivery campaigns by Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures in the PMD2009 48 system have concluded.

Guardian artefacts were delivered to the megaship Glorious Prospect, which was contracted on behalf of the anonymous 'Salvation', in greater quantities than to the Aegis megaship Archimedes.

Patience Middleton congratulated those who supported Taurus Mining Ventures:

« This is a clear show of faith in the noble goals of 'Salvation'. As a further sign of our commitment to those goals, we are pleased to provide the top 75% of contributors a specially engineered Class 2 Fixed Guardian Shard Cannon. »

The Pilots Federation has issued a caution that any ship modules offered by Taurus Mining Ventures will be automatically marked as ''hot', requiring extra costs to be cleaned prior to installation.


* Dredger Clan Arrives at Kumo City
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

A Blue Viper Club dredger has entered the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system, and may have links with the Kumo Crew syndicate.

The Dredger-class bulk cruiser has taken position near Kumo City, one of five starports recently constructed by pirate warlord Archon Delaine.

Dredger Clans are nomadic communities that travel on the fringes of civilisation, and their ancient vessels are rarely seen. Pilots in Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 have been warned to keep a safe distance from the dredger.

Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency published her observations:

« The Blue Viper Club is a fiercely independent tribe with an unsavoury reputation. Dredger Clans typically survive by gathering materials and salvage, but these people indulge in more criminal behaviour including drug running and raiding outposts. »

« The clan occupies more than one dredger, but these have never entered an inhabited system before now. There has been no conflict with local factions or system security. However, unmarked personnel shuttles have been witnessed travelling to and from the dredger. »

« Are we looking at a piratical alliance between the Blue Viper Club and the Kumo Crew? Is Archon Delaine expanding his reach to the Dredger Clans? Or have they brought him something of value that they discovered in deep space? »


* NMLA Political Wing Causes Controversy
The NMLA paramilitary group has confirmed that the Marlinism Reformation Party faction now acts as its political representative.

An anonymous statement was broadcast via the NMLA's propaganda channels:

« We support Minister Whyte in representing the Neo-Marlinist cause and speaking on our behalf. Our objectives remain unchanged \u2013 the removal of the Duval family and democratic elections within the Empire. »

Reactions were covered by several newsfeeds:

The Imperial Herald: « Senator Scordato's proposal to open diplomatic relations with the Marlinist Colonies is already contentious. But could the Emperor ever accept dialogue with the extremists who tried to murder the Imperial Family? »

The Federal Times: « The idea of negotiating with terrorists is as abhorrent to the Empire as to the Federation. And yet, the opportunity to prevent another 'Nine Martyrs' cannot be ignored. »

The Alliance Tribune: « In the absence of any breakthroughs from ACT, perhaps peaceful discussion is how we defuse the terrorist threat... even if that was the NMLA's endgame all along. »

The Marlin Standard: « Many of our people welcome closer ties with the Empire, especially if it involves contacting friends and families left behind. But the NMLA using our parliament as its platform has caused widespread unrest. With Aaron Whyte being openly challenged by other ministers, a Marlinist civil war no longer seems unthinkable. »


* Kumo Crew Initiative to Produce New Commodity
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew syndicate is requesting deliveries to mass-produce a recreational drug named 'helix'.

The drug is believed to originate with the Blue Viper Club, a nomadic clan travelling aboard an ancient dredger that recently appeared near Kumo City station.

Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, representing the Kumo Council, provided details to local newsfeed The Pegasi Sentinel:

« Helix will change lives across the galaxy! Derived from high-quality organic crops, and with many medicinal and psychological benefits, it is guaranteed to bring contentment. »

« All we need to kick-start manufacture are deliveries of agronomic treatment, liquid oxygen and performance enhancers to Kumo City in the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system. The Kumo Council also offers generous bounties on all wanted ships to protect traders carrying these commodities. »

Many authorities have registered concern that this will exacerbate drug addiction and misuse, which are common social problems. However, some markets have shown interest in the potential new product.

Vox Galactica has reported rumours that helix may be a previously unknown strain of onionhead, a highly popular psychedelic. It remains unknown whether the Blue Viper Club cultivated helix aboard their dredger or acquired it from another source.


* Independence Spreads from Azaladshu System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Azaladshu Free faction has defeated the forces of Neche Inc and retained independence from the Federation.

As a result, the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems have confirmed their independent status. The victory also inspired the Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour factions to secede from the Federation, affecting all systems under their control.

Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, declared:

« A Federation that abuses the rights of its people has no authority. With the help of our loyal supporters, we've made a stand for dignity and civil rights. »

The situation has caused turmoil in Congress, with President Zachary Hudson being criticised for his inability to contain this rebellion.

Shadow President Felicia Winters responded to accusations that she orchestrated the seceding factions:

« I support their rejection of our harsh surveillance laws, but not their methods of protest. I have no wish to see the Federation lose member systems for any reason. »

Pilots who supported the Azaladshu Free faction can collect their rewards at Eratosthenes Ring station.


* Scriveners Clan Abandons the Hesperus
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The dredger belonging to the Scriveners Clan has left the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, where the Hesperus megaship is located.

The 200-year-old 'ghost ship', once owned by Azimuth Biochemicals, was discovered in April when the nomadic clan began salvaging it for materials and data.

Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency speculated:

« When the Scriveners laid claim to the Hesperus, I expected only a cloud of fragments would remain. But their salvage operation has been prematurely abandoned, after stripping the megaship's innards and leaving behind a mostly intact hull. »

« Why have they done this? Perhaps because this particular dredger clan avoids outsiders. Public interest in the Hesperus inspired thousands of curious travellers to see it for themselves, potentially drawing more scrutiny than the secretive tribe could bear. »

« Alternatively, the Scriveners detected richer pickings elsewhere \u2013 either fresh resources for the dredger to consume or new information for their 'Knowledge Core'. In theory they could still be tracked down as their vessel's hyperdrive has a similar range to modern-day fleet carriers. »

« We know very little about the Scriveners, and even less about other clans. However, with the recent appearance of the Blue Viper Club dredger at Kumo City, I'm hopeful more may be revealed about these roaming societies. »


* The Story of Onionhead
A new product being manufactured by the Kumo Crew could be a version of onionhead, the controversial recreational drug.

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, published this review on Vox Galactica:

« Little is yet known about 'helix', but the persistent rumour that it is derived from onionhead has sparked keen interest from physicians, politicians and narcotics users alike. »

« Onionhead's active ingredient is extracted from plant seeds found only on Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system. Its psychotropic and hallucinogenic qualities are well documented, but there is conflicting evidence regarding addictive strength and toxicology. »

« This didn't stop it being banned in the Federation in 3300 by former President Jasmina Halsey, who was concerned about its popularity among youth culture. Political fireworks followed when Fleet Admiral Vincent bombed onionhead crops against her orders, which five years later led to the Scythe of Panem terrorists seeking revenge. »

« Production soon shifted to the Tanmark system, where the Lucan onionhead strain boosted its popularity. Two further variants have appeared since, a result of enterprising genetic engineers modifying the seeds to flourish in different ecospheres. »

« Could helix be another strain? The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) is currently acquiring samples for analysis, so we'll soon know if this marks a new chapter in onionhead's notorious story. »


* Marlinist Colonies Face Political Division
The Marlinist Consulate, established to represent Marlinists across the galaxy, has triggered political instability among the colonies.

Local newsfeed The Marlin Standard detailed the situation:

« The formation of the Marlinist Consulate will shortly conclude with the public election of its leader. The prime consul will serve as the official Marlinist representative to the superpowers, establish foreign embassies and make wide-reaching diplomatic decisions. »

« One of the two leading candidates is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation Party, who promises to speak for the Neo-Marlinist fringe. The Free Marlinist Movement's candidate, Kayode Tau, directly opposes that position. »

« Senator Lorcan Scordato has championed Dexter's bid, proposing that she be recognised as an Imperial patron to represent pro-Marlinist citizens of the Empire. Despite many protests, Chancellor Blaine concurred that patronage is within the purview of individual senators. »

« Some Marlinists see this as a chance to finally obtain influence in the Senate, after centuries of being marginalised. Others are enraged at Neo-Marlinists gaining legitimacy and acting as the NMLA's political wing. »

« The rift has affected parliament, where First Minister Fairfax again urged Minister Aaron Whyte to cease representing the NMLA and hand over all information to ACT. Whyte retorted that his diplomatic breakthroughs would soon make the counter-terrorism unit redundant. »


* Data Required for Marlinist Election
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Rival candidates have requested deliveries of data to help secure their bids to lead the Marlinist Consulate.

The Marlinist Colonies are voting for who will be elected as their prime consul. This influential role will diplomatically represent all Marlinists and make broad decisions on their behalf.

The first candidate is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation Party, which is acting as the NMLA political wing. She has the support of Senator Lorcan Scordato to be made an Imperial patron:

« I am in a unique position to finally provide our people with a voice in the Imperial Senate, and to speak for Neo-Marlinists. As prime consul, I will negotiate a permanent peace with the NMLA. »

The second candidate, Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement, is focused on sustaining the Marlinist Colonies:

« Neo-Marlinism and terrorism have no place within our republican ideals. I will strive to keep our systems independent, and to protect the rights of peaceful Marlinists everywhere. »

In order to help secure their campaigns, both candidates have requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files. Shipments for Verity Dexter should be delivered to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system, while those for Kayode Tau are expected at Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have recognised the Marlinist Consulate as an ambassadorial body, and agreed that the election of its prime consul is a strictly internal matter.


* Kumo Crew Campaign Starts Drug Production
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has procured enough materials to introduce a new product to the market.

The drug originated with the Blue Viper Club, a piratical travelling community whose dredger is currently in the vicinity of Kumo City station.

It was confirmed that enough shipments of agronomic treatment, liquid oxygen and performance enhancers were received to enable immediate mass production. Pilots also fought to protect haulage vessels from pirate ships, suspected to be Kumo Crew rivals.

The Interstellar Health Organisation has obtained a product sample and confirmed that, despite the name 'helix', it is a new variant of the recreational drug onionhead. As such, the product will be legally classified as onionhead gamma strain when it appears on the market.

Despite claims of medicinal and psychological benefits, it is likely to be illegal in most systems. President Zachary Hudson, Princess Aisling Duval and several other political heavyweights have expressed outrage at the open manner by which its ingredients were procured.

Archon Delaine, warlord of the Kumo Crew, responded:

« Every system government generates revenue from the pharmaceutical trade, so the holier-than-thou attitude from these hypocrites turns my stomach. Helix brings happiness, and provides income for my people. I make no apologies! »

Rewards for pilots who contributed to this campaign are now available at Kumo City in the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system.


* Galactic Mysteries: The Far God Cult
The enigmatic Thargoid-worshipping religious order is examined by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency.

« Of all the myriad faiths practised across the galaxy, the Far God cult is one of the strangest and least understood. But in recent years it has grown from a fringe sect to a widespread religion. »

« Its central tenet is that an unknowable being exists beyond our dimension \u2013 the Far God. What we call the Thargoids are its heralds, preparing for when it descends from hyperspace to instantly wipe out all life. This apocalyptic creed therefore attracts people who have nothing to live for, and who find purpose in awaiting armageddon. »

« The cult has no official name or spokespeople, and its followers willingly replace their names with titles such as adherent, disciple and witness. This dehumanising approach includes its members wearing simple black robes and making their hive-chapels resemble Thargoid bio-technology, complete with ammonia fumes. »

« Despite praying to an alien species, this is not the Thargoid fifth column many feared it to be. In fact they are pacifistic fatalists, expecting death and never offering resistance. This has caused them to be victimised by other doomsayer cults, anti-xeno activists and even the Federal Intelligence Agency\u2026 yet their serene patience has allowed them to survive. »

« The discovery of two abandoned void-temples in the Etain system provided an insight into the cultists' mindset. Here can be heard the final testaments of people willingly entombed in suspended animation to await the Far God's arrival. »

« More recently there are reports of several chapters of the sect migrating to the Panjabell system. This is controlled by the Pleiades Concordat, a theocracy devoted to the Far God, so perhaps it is preparing something bigger \u2013 or stranger \u2013 than we've seen before. »


* IHO Reports on New Onionhead Variant
The Interstellar Health Organisation has published a preliminary analysis of onionhead gamma strain, a recreational drug also known as 'helix'.

« As with the alpha, beta and Lucan strains, the active component is derived from seeds produced by the onionhead flower native to the planet Panem. These contain alkaloid compounds that have a temporary psychoactive effect on human perceptions and cognitive functions. »

« In the gamma strain, these compounds have been genetically modified using synthetic molecules of unknown origin. This has diluted the concentration of psychotropics, therefore producing less intense hallucinogenic episodes. »

« The practical advantages of these modifications are twofold. First, they allow onionhead to be economically mass-produced using artificial environments rather than grown as natural crops. Second, the gamma strain is more hardy and able to survive for longer periods in storage or sub-zero temperatures. »

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, commented:

« The IHO's report suggests we are looking at a type of onionhead designed to be sold in greater volume than previous variants. Its sophisticated composition means it is unlikely to have been developed by the Blue Viper Club. It's possible that the nomads acquired it from an unidentified research facility, and have now cut a deal with the Kumo Crew for distribution. »


* Federation Threatened by Further Secession
More Federal factions are considering declaring independence following the recent conflict in the Azaladshu system.

Sofia Trevino, political journalist with The Federal Times, published an overview of the situation:

« When Azaladshu Free seceded in reaction to the government's surveillance laws, it inspired three other factions to do the same, making ten systems and a billion people independent. Superpowers routinely gain and lose systems via local politics, but this was a rare instance of member factions abandoning their fealty. »

« The newly sovereign nations have severed all links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, so their communications are no longer being monitored. Despite broad public support for the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, many citizens still consider personal privacy to be a constitutional right. »

« Dozens of other factions are now considering independence. This affects only a small percentage of the systems under Federal control, but is highly embarrassing for President Hudson as well as Shadow President Winters \u2013 her organised resistance to the surveillance laws is what inspired factions to secede. »

« Advocacy, the civil rights organisation, claims that the Federal Intelligence Agency has begun arresting secessionist ringleaders under spurious charges. If true, it suggests that the government will go to any lengths to prevent a full-scale rebellion spreading throughout the Federation. »


* Initiative to Outfit Far God Megaships
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Pleiades Concordat has requested deliveries to support the Far God cult in the Panjabell system.

Members of the secretive Thargoid-worshipping sect have gathered in huge numbers, and are preparing to outfit one or more megaships for religious purposes.

Although the cult has no official spokespeople, local newsfeeds carried a brief message from one of its senior members, known only as the First Herald of the Fifty-Eighth Chapter:

« The faithful have hidden in the shadows for too long. Now is the time to reach out and welcome the Far God, with the support of our friends in the Pleiades Concordat. »

« The first megaship, the Testament, will be a missionary vessel to spread the word to all humankind. If we are blessed enough to obtain commodities for more megaships, these will be sent on a pilgrimage into deep space to commune with the Far God. »

The Pleiades Concordat has requested that pilots deliver auto fabricators, emergency power cells and insulating membrane to Moore Hub in the Panjabell system.

Far God believers are generally accepted to be non-threatening, albeit controversial due to their reverence of the Thargoids. As the cultists are routinely targeted by anti-xeno extremists, the Pleiades Concordat has placed bounties on all wanted ships to protect deliveries.


* Free Marlinist Candidate Wins Election
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Kayode Tau has been elected as prime consul for the Marlinists, following a successful data delivery initiative.

The candidate from the Free Marlinist Movement faction received more public votes than rival nominee Verity Dexter. His campaign was supported by deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files in greater quantities.

Prime Consul Tau will now serve as the lead ambassador for the Marlinist Colonies in all dealings with the superpowers. He gave this statement to the media:

« The Marlinist Consulate will act to preserve our colonies' independence, and improve diplomatic relations with the rest of the galaxy. Let me be clear \u2013 we do not represent the extremist views of Neo-Marlinism. Our consuls will assist all efforts to eliminate the NMLA. »

In the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Aaron Whyte protested that ignoring the Neo-Marlinist fringe was « a provocative act that could inflame further violence ». First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for the result of the democratic vote to be respected.

Pilots who supported Kayode Tau can now collect their rewards from Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 system.


* New Onionhead Variant Reaches the Market
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Onionhead gamma strain is now available in selected industrial anarchy systems.

Following the Kumo Council's initiative, enough product was manufactured to supply approximately 10% of all industrial-based markets controlled by anarchic factions. Unlike previous versions of onionhead, this variant is not listed as a rare commodity.

Adalyn Cross, a journalist for Vox Galactica, reported:

« Onionhead gamma strain is being marketed to the public for medicinal use, but most customers are under no illusions regarding its real benefits. The Coalition for Legalisation claims that it is 'no more harmful or addictive than alcohol or coffee, with potential psychological and palliative benefits'. »

« This has not prevented many authorities, especially in the Federation, from demanding that it remain universally outlawed. It is currently illegal in all but anarchy jurisdictions. There are serious concerns that it may act as a gateway drug to more harmful substances. Security services are also unhappy about the extra revenue flowing into Archon Delaine's coffers. »

« Some logistics experts noted that onionhead gamma strain was distributed with surprising speed. It is already being reported as available from the following systems: Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond and Nocori. It's been suggested that Sirius Corporation is secretly ferrying shipments of the drug via its freight transportation network, and is part of the deal between the Kumo Crew and the Blue Viper Club. Sinclair Faraldo, VP of Corporate Marketing, rejected this claim as 'absurd and libellous'. »


* Federal Surveillance Sabotages Independence
Communications intercepted by the Proactive Detection Bureau are being used to prevent further factions from leaving the Federation.

A report by the civil rights organisation Advocacy proves that the Federal Intelligence Agency is targeting pro-independence individuals via their private messages. In many cases, they are being arrested for planning to commit crimes against the constitution.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the PDB, gave a statement to the media:

« I can confirm that gathering such intelligence is within our legal remit. Unilateral declarations of independence are criminal acts that violate the Federal Accord. Therefore we are identifying perpetrators before they cause harm, which is precisely what our surveillance network was established to do. »

In Congress, Vice President Jerome Archer defended the PDB for boosting arrest rates and saving lives. However, Congressman Bai Zheng remarked that the PDB was « incapable of locating the NMLA, but fantastic at finding enemies among our own people that didn't previously exist ».

Both President Hudson and Shadow President Winters have personally contacted the leaders of many systems within their spheres of influence, aiming to address their concerns and convince them not to secede from the Federation.


* Aegis Investigated After Megaship Loss
The superpowers have partly suspended Aegis and authorised an inquiry into the Alexandria megaship, which disappeared in hyperspace.

Freelance journalist Alexei Keel reported on this development for Vox Galactica:

« Public opinion regarding Aegis has always been chequered, but its founding governments insisted that it played a vital defensive role against the Thargoids. The tragic loss of the Alexandria, carrying thousands of crewmembers and valuable Guardian artefacts, has now raised questions about the organisation's competence. »

« The Alliance, Empire and Federation have jointly ordered an independent inquiry to determine the facts about the Alexandria. Many Aegis operations were shut down, and detailed investigations have begun. Professor Alba Tesreau and other senior members have already been forced to resign. »

« Part of the reason for such scrutiny is the emergence of the anonymous 'Salvation', who many view as running an alternative anti-xeno effort. Some security agencies suspect him to be the leader of an Aegis splinter group, composed of rogue agents and stolen resources. »


* NMLA Attacks Marlinist Starports
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The NMLA has bombed two starports in the HIP 22550 and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 systems in the Marlinist Colonies.

Explosive devices were detonated at both Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations. As is characteristic of weapons used by the NMLA, caustic enzyme payloads caused widespread corrosive damage.

The combined death toll is in the tens of thousands, with many more injured. There are unconfirmed reports that First Minister Jenna Fairfax is among the fatalities.

The following message was broadcast via NMLA propaganda channels:

« Why are they bombing their own homes? Why would Theta Seven kill his own people? Because they are not our homes! Not my people! They are prisons, not colonies, where traitors to the cause beg for scraps from those who exiled them. True Marlinists will never stop fighting until the Republic of Achenar is restored. »

The attacks are believed to be in response to Verity Dexter failing to win a public vote to lead the Marlinist Consulate, where she would have represented the NMLA political wing.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau, the elected candidate, announced:

« I call upon the galactic community to provide humanitarian aid to Stillman Hub in HIP 22550 and Tilman Point in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6. We urgently require ships to evacuate the people trapped within these starports to safety. »


* Far God Megaship Initiative Concludes
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Independent pilots have supported the Far God cult by delivering commodities to the Panjabell system.

The Pleiades Concordat paid for shipments of auto fabricators, emergency power cells and insulating membrane transported to Moore Hub station. These will be used to outfit megaships that will be populated by the Thargoid-worshipping cultists.

Local reporters spoke to one of the sect's newest converts, Leonard Yates from Agassiz Settlement, now known as the Eighty-Ninth Adherent of the Sixtieth Chapter:

« The beneficence of the galactic community is deeply appreciated. Our missionary megaship, the Testament, will help carry news of the oncoming apocalypse to every system. »

« The other megaships \u2013 the Perdition and the Sacrosanct  \u2013 will soon embark on a holy pilgrimage. They will carry thousands of us faithful worshippers into the void to commune with the Far God and hasten Its arrival. »

Pilots who contributed to the Pleiades Concordat's initiative can now collect their rewards from Moore Hub in the Panjabell system.


* Rebellion Spreads Across Federal Systems
New Kuwembaa Labour, which controls five systems, has triggered a second wave of secession by severing ties with the Federation.

Following the victory of the Azaladshu Free, a minority of Federal factions are breaking away from the superpower in protest against its civil surveillance laws.

Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour made this statement:

« The Federal government has granted itself draconian powers to spy on its own citizens. Regrettably, the only way to avoid this is to withdraw from the Federal Accord. I urge the president to respect our wishes and accept our sovereign status. »

In response, President Zachary Hudson ordered Governor Mishra to abide by constitutional law or face the consequences. He has also redirected the Fortress Liberty megaship to the Kuwembaa system.

Political commentators believe that three other democratic Federal factions are ready to follow the example of New Kuwembaa Labour. If this occurs, up to 28 further systems could become independent as a result.

There are also reports that influential leaders within the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour, which both recently seceded, have expressed regret about leaving the Federation. The congressmen who previously represented them believe that these factions could be swayed to return.


* Marlinists in Crisis After Starport Bombings
The NMLA's attacks against the Marlinist Colonies have caused mass casualties, disruption and political chaos.

More than 35,000 civilians were killed in the attacks, with twice as many suffering injuries and caustic burns. Safeguard Interstellar is providing vital supplies to survivors, and evacuations of Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations are ongoing.

First Minister Jenna Fairfax has been confirmed dead. Minister Amrita Ross has temporarily assumed leadership, but the Marlinist Parliament has been destabilised by heated accusations between its members.

The Marlinist Constabulary has tightened security, and ACT is running urgent investigations. Captain Milo Castile told the media:

« This was undoubtedly the work of Theta Group, the NMLA's weapons specialists. We have found evidence that local Neo-Marlinist supporters provided logistical support, and arrests are forthcoming. However, as always the terrorists covered their tracks remarkably well. »

Alliance and Federation leaders have sent messages of condolence and offers of medical aid. Prime Consul Kayode Tau is liaising with both superpowers to coordinate relief efforts.

In the Empire, from which the Marlinists fled as refugees in 3306, there are mixed reactions. Some wish to extend protection to former Imperial citizens, while others see it as poetic justice for their republican beliefs 'creating' the NMLA.


* Superpowers Respond to New Onionhead
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have clarified their official positions regarding the emergence of onionhead gamma strain.

All variants of the popular psychedelic drug remain illegal within Federal space. Ambassador Jasmina Halsey, who was president in 3300 when the ruling was made, announced:

« I am pleased that my decision to outlaw onionhead stands. I still maintain that it leads to experimentation with more dangerous narcotics, and we must steer our youth away from that path. »

The Empire has also declared onionhead illegal, despite rumours that it is imported by the wealthiest citizens for private use. Princess Aisling Duval told the media:

« It was insulting enough that Delaine was allowed into the Galactic Summit, but now he's peddling filthy drugs and pretending it's medicine! I only pray that nobody loses a loved one to such poison, as I have. »

The Alliance has not made a broad ruling regarding onionhead, which is illegal in the majority of member systems but available in those classified as having anarchy governments. However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran addressed the issue:

« As with most trade, we defer to the legislation of local authorities. But we are in contact with the IHO and are keeping a close eye on the situation. »

Onionhead gamma strain remains on sale in selected systems governed by industrial anarchy factions.


* Federal Forces Combat New Rebellion
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

In the Kuwembaa system, the Federation is fighting to prevent further factions from declaring independence.

New Kuwembaa Labour has broken ties with the Federation in protest against the government's civil surveillance programme.

Li Chotep for Equality, a local Federal faction, has been tasked to degrade the rebelling faction's military strength. President Zachary Hudson made a brief public announcement:

« I call upon all Federal auxiliaries to aid in this conflict. The reputation of the Federation cannot be so easily tarnished by such criminal action. »

Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour, also requested assistance:

« The Federal Accord is no longer fit for purpose. We require support to make a stand against this violation of our constitutional rights. »

Three other Federal factions are about to declare themselves as independent sovereign states: Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future. These control a combined total of 28 systems.

However, two recently seceded factions \u2013 the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour \u2013 are considering rejoining the Federation, depending on the result of the Kuwembaa conflict.

Pro-independence pilots can support New Kuwembaa Labour by delivering combat bonds to Gagnan Port station. Federal auxiliaries can fight on behalf of Li Chotep for Equality by handing in combat bonds at the Fortress Liberty megaship.


* Thargoid Cultists Prepare for Religious Voyages
Three megaships are being populated by the Far God cult, part of their latest effort to recruit members and find their alien deity.

The first vessel, the Testament, will serve as a missionary ship and journey throughout the core systems, attempting to convert new followers to the Thargoid-worshipping sect.

While the mystical cult is typically secretive in nature, Vox Galactica obtained a quote from a member named the Second Witness of the Seventieth Chapter:

« The masses are deaf to the voice of the Far God. What you see as alien monsters, we view as messengers from a very real multi-dimensional being. The Testament will help us carry the word of Its imminent arrival. »

Two other megaships have been outfitted for long-range journeys. The Perdition and the Sacrosanct will carry many thousands of cultists on what they view as a pilgrimage to the Far God.

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian and expert on the religion, commented:

« This fringe creed, which has survived endless abuse and attacks, has now reached a surprising level of organisation. Most of us associate the Thargoids with death and destruction, making it all the more remarkable that these people see only divinity. »


* Tensions Inflamed in Marlinist Colonies
The bombing of two Marlinist starports by the NMLA has caused political rifts and public protests across the colony systems.

Local newsfeed The Marlin Standard reported on current events:

« Our entire society is still reeling in shock after last week's attacks against Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations. There has been mass panic in fear of further terrorist strikes, with unprecedented scenes of violence against known Neo-Marlinist supporters. »

« Without the respected leadership of First Minister Jenna Fairfax, angry exchanges and recriminations have divided the Marlinist Parliament. Minister Aaron Whyte claimed that 'we invited this tragedy upon ourselves' by not voting for a Neo-Marlinist prime consul. In response, Minister Octavia Volkov called for Whyte's arrest as 'an accessory to mass murder'. »

« Some community leaders expressed sorrow at a lost opportunity to establish a Marlinist presence in the Imperial Senate. This is certainly the view of Acting First Minister Amrita Ross, who believes in rejoining the Empire. »

« All of which has led to a baptism of fire for Prime Consul Kayode Tau, whose focus has been on arranging medical aid from the Alliance and Federation. It may be that the Marlinist Consulate will soon be called upon to mediate between its own people. »


* Zemina Torval Creates New Corporation
A new independent branch of Mastopolos Mining has been established by its controlling shareholder, Senator Zemina Torval.

The megacorp is owned by the powerful Mastopolos family, and operates throughout the Empire and beyond. However, Torval's position as a majority shareholder has allowed her to exert a strong influence on its activities.

Senator Torval confirmed her plans in a statement to The Imperial Herald:

« Diversification is an effective strategy in the current business climate. Torval-Mastopolos Mining will have corporate autonomy, while offering the same mining and transportation services to an emergent client base. »

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reported:

« The persistent rumours of a rift between Zemina Torval and her cousin, CEO Gabriella Mastopolos, may now be validated. Insiders report that after decades of working behind the scenes, Torval wishes to provide a more tangible legacy for her own children. Already she has set her sights on a permit-controlled system as the headquarters for this new company. »

As well as being renowned for her private wealth and corporate enterprises, Zemina Torval has been a prominent member of the Imperial Senate for decades. She has occasionally deputised as chancellor, and is known to be an outspoken champion of the Empire's traditions.


* Aegis Probed by Board of Inquiry
An investigation into the tri-superpower organisation Aegis is seeking to establish the reasons for its failures.

Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry, outlined its scope:

« The initial phase is to fully understand the work of Aegis, before examining strategic and operational decisions. Interviews with senior staff have been scheduled, with Admiral Aden Tanner providing details on military activity. »

« One specific area of attention is the lost megaship Alexandria. We are performing a thorough analysis, including background checks on its crew. Hyperspace physicists are theorising probable causes for its failure to arrive at HIP 30944. »

« We will be raising issues of culpability, specifically whether the concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Alexandria directly led to systems coming under Thargoid attack. Other incidents will be reviewed to identify possible grounds for negligence. »

Many prominent figures within Aegis have resigned including Professor Alba Tesreau, Director Yazhu Xing and Dr Mia Valencourt. All active projects have been suspended, with routine activities continuing under independent observation.

Some politicians in all three superpowers have protested against the inquiry, concerned about weakening defences against the Thargoids. Others believe Aegis is not fit for purpose, calling for a more localised approach to anti-xeno operations.


* Marlinist Civil War Declared
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Conflict has erupted in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system between two factions of the Marlinist Colonies.

The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine has declared war against the Marlinism Reformation Party, which acts as the political wing of the NMLA.

Political relations degenerated into open combat following the NMLA's recent attacks, with Acting First Minister Amrita Ross's efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution proving unsuccessful.

A new megaship, Freedom's Voice, has entered service. It is acting as the operational base for the forces of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine.

Supporters of the Marlinism Reformation Party are gathering at the Steel Majesty megaship. This was formerly used by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid to flee from their home system.

Minister Octavia Volkov announced in parliament:

« Aaron Whyte and his collaborators are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. I will not rest until they are defeated and brought to justice. »

Minister Aaron Whyte sent this response from his private vessel:

« Volkov's unlawful strike is a violation of our colonies' charter. We call upon all true Marlinists to defend us from this illegal act of aggression. »

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have informed the Marlinist Consulate that they consider this conflict to be a strictly internal matter.


* Victory Against Federation for Independent Factions
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

New Kuwembaa Labour has successfully seceded from the Federation and inspired other systems to declare independence.

The conflict in the Kuwembaa system ended with Federal loyalists Li Chotep for Equality being defeated. As a result, all systems controlled by New Kuwembaa Labour will remain independent.

This has inspired Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future to also sever ties with the Federation, spreading the rebellion across a further 28 systems.

The victory was announced by Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour:

« We owe a huge debt to all pilots who helped us secure our freedom. It is regrettable that we were forced to secede, but this should be a warning to President Hudson that he is taking the Federation down a dangerous path. »

The rebelling systems have now shut down links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all private and public communications. More Federal factions are now debating secession as the only way to guarantee their citizens' privacy rights.

Pilots who fought for New Kuwembaa Labour can now claim their rewards from Gagnan Port station. Li Chotep for Equality will reimburse Federal auxiliaries at the Fortress Liberty megaship.


* Onionhead Legality Sparks Debate
The introduction of onionhead gamma strain by the Kumo Crew has reignited long-running arguments around the popular psychedelic drug.

An interview with Zander Lachance, spokesperson for the Coalition for Legalisation, was published by Vox Galactica:

« I have yet to see evidence that onionhead is more harmful than common recreational substances. Open-minded people in independent systems are now discovering this for themselves. »

In response, other newsfeeds featured a range of opinions.

Eye on Achenar: « Foppish rogues of the Federation such as Zachary Rackham and Sir Randolph Plaskett may feel comfortable wooing trade tycoons with the outlawed weed, but legalising low-cost onionhead would risk the whole Empire collapsing into a stupor! »

The Pegasi Sentinel: « The popularity of 'helix' is steadily growing, and the revenue it generates will undoubtedly benefit those fortunate to live within Archon Delaine's dominion. »

Sol Today: « Imperial hedonists such as Senator Leatrix and Duchess Rouncival may offer such illicit treats at their decadent parties, but bombarding the masses with this cheap narcotic will have the entire Federation chasing unicorns! »

The Sovereign: « Tourists from many independent worlds are booking holidays to the Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond and Nocori systems, where the gamma strain of onionhead is legal. There is no shortage of Alliance citizens following suit, which may pressure the Assembly to formally legislate one way or the other. »


* Rival Corporations Compete in LTT 198
Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have both established a presence in the LTT 198 system.

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reviewed the situation:

« It is highly unusual for two megacorps to set up new headquarters in the same place. But Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have always competed aggressively for mining and transportation contracts, so it seems a new chapter in their rivalry has begun. »

« This permit-locked system is controlled by the independent faction LTT 198 State Ltd. Insiders claim that it demanded a fortune from both corporations in return for granting passage to its ships and allowing construction of industrial complexes on the planet Dini. »

« This is the first significant move from Senator Zemina Torval's new company, an autonomous offshoot of Mastopolos Mining. It may be that Wreaken Construction's presence is an effort to crush their old enemy before she can acquire further corporate strength. »

The Imperial Herald reported that Constantia Torval, one of Zemina Torval's daughters, has travelled from the Synteini system to LTT 198. It is believed Constantia has taken command of Torval-Mastopolos Mining's operations.


* Leaked Report Exposes Aegis Failures
The Aegis board of inquiry's initial findings have been leaked to journalists, with several problems within the anti-xeno organisation detailed in the files.

Vox Galactica journalist Alexei Keel reported on its contents:

« The independent inquiry into Aegis is in its early stages, making this disclosure of delicate information all the more embarrassing. Although only a summary, it highlights shortcomings that were immediately apparent to the investigators. »

« The leaked files outline a pattern of poor internal organisation and negligence. One claim is that Aegis accepted its heavy reliance on independent pilots entering combat situations against the Thargoids. »

« A lack of technological breakthroughs since the first generation of AX weaponry is also criticised. Professor Tesreau, who has since resigned, is singled out for prioritising communication with the Thargoids rather than developing quickly deployed defences. »

« Interview transcripts show that some Aegis personnel consider the inquiry itself to be part of a larger agenda. A recurring claim is that the superpowers directly contributed to Aegis's inefficiency by reducing funding, and are now scapegoating Aegis management for a lack of progress. »

« Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the board of inquiry, said that only the final report should be considered official. It is unclear when the 'Baumann Report', as some newsfeeds refer to it, might be ready for publication. »


* Anti-NMLA Forces Win Marlinist Civil War
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The conflict in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system has been won by the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine.

Support from independent pilots played a key role in defeating the Marlinism Reformation Party. The faction's entire leadership has been arrested, with their replacements vowing to reshape it along politically moderate lines.

Minister Octavia Volkov made a declaration of victory to the Marlinist Parliament:

« The Neo-Marlinists have been crushed and Aaron Whyte is dead \u2013 a casualty of the war his terrorist paymasters began. I deeply regret that our society has suffered this, but have no regrets at destroying the NMLA's political wing once and for all. »

Prime Consul Kayode Tau sent assurances to the Alliance, Empire and Federation that they should view this as « confirmation that the Marlinist Colonies are your steadfast allies in the fight against the NMLA ».

ACT has drafted in extra resources to investigate the Marlinism Reformation Party's ties to Theta Group, the terrorist bomb-makers responsible for last month's devastating starport attacks.

With First Minister Jenna Fairfax confirmed as among the fatalities, Acting First Minister Amrita Ross has organised a snap election to democratically appoint a new leader for the Marlinist Colonies.


* LTT 198 Hosts Competing Mining Campaigns
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have requested deliveries of mined resources to the LTT 198 system.

LTT 198 State Ltd, its controlling faction, will only allow one of the rival corporations to remain permanently. The company with the most successful campaign will establish a new starport in the permit-controlled system.

Senator Zemina Torval, who has sole control of the Mastopolos Mining subsidiary, announced:

« My company is working on an experimental mining laser with increased range. To achieve this, shipments of mined resources must be delivered in sufficient numbers to the Pride of Bitterwood megaship in LTT 198. »

Emmerich Koenig, CEO of Wreaken Construction, outlined a counter-initiative:

« We will pay handsomely for deliveries of mined resources to the megaship Tobias's Gift in the LTT 198 system. »

Both factions have requested units of coltan, gallite, praseodymium and silver.

LTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives with temporary system permits lasting one week.


* Conspiracy Theorist Finds Network Home
Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse has announced that the Rewired network will broadcast Kit Fowler's conspiracy-laden show End Times.

Lafosse, notorious for his own sensationalist claims, announced:

« Finally, someone else who sees things as they really are! Kit Fowler's perceptive views match his technical genius. By retransmitting his End Times broadcasts, I'll be helping people resist the narrative conditioning being pumped into our minds by the faceless elite. »

Kit Fowler provides specialised engineering services from his workshop in the Capoya system. He has used his show to make many outlandish claims over the years. These include labelling the shadowy figure 'Salvation' an AI construct, accusing Utopia of secretly creating a new species of human, and arguing that the universe's true shape is being concealed by superpower-sponsored holograms.

Lafosse advertised Fowler's content with an excerpt from the most recent End Times episode:

« Years ago, a sinister group called Black Flight committed multiple crimes, including murder, to suppress evidence of Thargoid activity after the First War. The mainstream newsfeeds buried the story, of course. But the fearless truth-seekers among us have repeatedly named the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems as locations where the Black Flight operated. »

« There's a real buzz in that region right now\u2026 something's going on that they don't want you to know about. Never give up our search for the right facts, people! »


* A Fractured Federation
Shadow President Felicia Winters has claimed that further systems declaring independence could severely damage the Federation.

Her statement was in response to the conflict in the Kuwembaa system, which resulted in more Federal factions seceding from the superpower. Dozens of others are now openly considering breaking away and becoming independent.

Addressing Congress, Shadow President Winters said:

« We now face the possibility of large-scale rebellion, as more citizens reject intrusion into their private lives. Unless these authoritarian surveillance laws are repealed, we risk many more factions and allies losing their trust in any Federal government. »

Vice President Jerome Archer responded:

« The Proactive Detection Bureau provides increased security and decreased crime levels for all Federal systems. I deeply regret that a few have rejected its benefits, but we must concentrate on the bigger picture. »

The Sovereign newsfeed described how the newly seceded systems are celebrating freedom from government scrutiny. It claims that up to fifty other factions have expressed interest in becoming independent.

However, The Federal Times reported that more pragmatic leaders have voiced concerns that they are now more vulnerable. There are particular fears of retaliation by pro-Federation groups or attacks from opportunistic hostile forces.


* Onionhead's Medical Benefits Verified
The Interstellar Health Organisation has validated the Kumo Crew's claim that onionhead gamma strain, also known as 'helix', has medicinal properties.

Dr Nisha Devi, one of the IHO's senior researchers, told the media:

« We have analysed user data in the independent systems where onionhead gamma strain is on sale. Unexpectedly, the initial marketing claims that 'helix' can be used for medicinal purposes have been authenticated. »

« A significant percentage of customers are believed to be using the drug for healthcare reasons rather than recreational use. Reports show that it is a successful treatment for many psychological disorders, bringing faster results than conventional neuroleptics. It may also provide effective symptomatic relief for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. »

« Several research facilities are now running clinical trials on the viability of using onionhead gamma strain in medical practice. The IHO is monitoring these studies and will publish the results. »

Vandermeer Corporation, the largest pharmaceutical company in the Federation, published a statement from its head of marketing Ronan Roscoe:

« These conclusions are biased and informed by inaccurate data. We maintain that all forms of onionhead are dangerous narcotics with long-term detriments to health. Vandermeer's antipsychotic treatments are effective without the side effects of mild psychedelic experiences. »


* Mining Campaign Success for Zemina Torval
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Torval-Mastopolos Mining initiative in the LTT 198 system has outperformed Wreaken Construction's rival campaign.

Pilots delivered mined resources to the megaships Pride of Bitterwood and Tobias's Gift to support the competing corporations. Ultimately, it was the new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that received the greatest quantities.

Senator Zemina Torval provided a statement to Imperial media:

« This is an auspicious beginning for my new enterprise. I am pleased to offer rewards to my supporters at the Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system. »

In addition to credits, the top 75% of Torval's supporters will be provided with an experimental mining laser and permanent permit access to LTT 198.

Constantia Torval, one of the senator's daughters, has assumed the role of director of operations with Torval-Mastopolos Mining. There has been no comment from the Mastopolos family regarding the subsidiary, which is being run autonomously by Zemina Torval.

CEO Emmerich Koenig confirmed that Wreaken Construction will soon withdraw from LTT 198. Pilots who supported its efforts can now claim reimbursement from Tobias's Gift in the EGM 559 system. The top 10% of Koenig's supporters will receive an experimental abrasion blaster as well.

LTT 198 State Ltd has reinstated permit control for entry to the LTT 198 system. A new starport will shortly be constructed and administered by Torval-Mastopolos Mining.


* Marlinists Regroup in Civil War Aftermath
The Marlinist Colonies are recovering from a period of political infighting and inter-faction conflict.

Octavia Volkov has been voted in as the new first minister following a snap election. Her decisive action against Aaron Whyte's Neo-Marlinist movement, which led to the elimination of the NMLA's political wing, drew huge support from voters.

In a parliamentary address, First Minister Volkov said:

« We must focus on building an independent society rather than changing the Empire. In time we will evolve into the fully-fledged Marlinist Republic we have fought so hard for, and perhaps inspire our Imperial cousins to walk the path to democracy. »

Marlinist factions now control all eight of their original colony systems, some of which had temporarily fallen under external governance. They have also expanded into a handful of new systems.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau, the chief ambassador of the Marlinists, has established formal channels with the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations and the Federal Diplomatic Corps. The Empire recognises the Marlinist Consulate, but maintains a distant relationship with what many consider to be subversive ex-Imperials.

The ceremonial funeral of First Minister Jenna Fairfax has taken place. Speakers drew attention to her achievements and leadership qualities. In a gesture that many viewed as an olive branch from the Empire, Princess Aisling Duval attended virtually and spoke of her meeting with Fairfax during the Galactic Summit.


* Corporation Plans Onionhead Medical Product
The pharmaceutical giant Neomedical Industries aims to mass-produce onionhead gamma strain as a medicine.

The announcement follows a report from the Interstellar Health Organisation, which details how the new onionhead variant is an effective treatment for many psychological and musculoskeletal conditions.

Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, told the media:

« The IHO has confirmed the findings of our research of onionhead gamma strain's use for specific medical purposes. Clinical trials prove that its psychedelic qualities are no more intense than the side effects of conventional neuroleptics. »

« It is inappropriate that a crime syndicate should provide a product that can relieve the suffering of millions. Therefore, we aim to build our own stockpile to expedite its distribution to common markets. »

This statement was viewed as controversial in some quarters, particularly within the Federation. However, there have been expressions of interest from many independent factions. The Kumo Crew syndicate, which manufactures and distributes onionhead gamma strain, has offered no response as yet.

Neomedical Industries is one of the two largest pharmaceutical companies in the galaxy, alongside Vandermeer Corporation. It provides healthcare services and equipment exclusively to Alliance and independent systems.


* Hyford's Cache Reveals Mysterious Project
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

A data bank left by a crashed vessel on the moon Colonia 5 e a has reactivated, revealing clues as to its origin.

The crash site was first discovered over four years ago via listening posts in the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems. These posts held transmissions from the ship's owner, Commander Hyford, discussing his attempts to avoid members of a private military outfit he had previously worked for.

This latest development was discussed by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency:

« Commander Hyford spoke of making deliveries to a nameless organisation in the Pleiades, and left a data cache in the Colonia system that provided further details. Hyford's Cache, as some investigators referred to it, had remained locked until a manually-set timer system finally expired last week. The information within has apparently directed pilots to investigate the HIP 26176 system. »

« It's possible that Kit Fowler's recent theories regarding Black Flight \u2013 another old mystery \u2013 might prove relevant after all. But there are bigger questions that need answering. Who was Hyford working for? Were they responsible for causing his ship to crash? And if so, what secrets were they trying to keep? »


* Federation Criticised by Alliance and Empire
Alliance and Imperial leaders have responded to the recent wave of Federal systems declaring independence.

Eight factions have now severed ties with the Federation, in response to government surveillance of all private and public communications.

In an interview with The Alliance Tribune, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran remarked:

« The Proactive Detection Bureau's intrusive nature has caused millions of people to rightfully demand self-rule. President Hudson should be fearful that history might view him as the Federation's first dictator. »

Senator Denton Patreus's comments were featured by Eye on Achenar:

« Of course the Federation's factions are turning against it. The arrogance and corruption of its leaders will inevitably cause it to rot from within. We can expect to see it dissolve into chaos before long. »

Federal newsfeed Sol Today published a response by Vice President Jerome Archer:

« Both the Alliance and Empire have chosen a reactionary approach to terrorism, whereas the Federation has made great strides in intelligence-gathering and preventative action. I'm confident that the Proactive Detection Bureau will come to be accepted as one of the galaxy's greatest innovations. »


* Pharma Giant Begins Onionhead Project
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Neomedical Industries has requested deliveries to produce onionhead gamma strain for Alliance and independent systems.

The new variant of the popular psychedelic drug is currently sold in a handful of independent systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate. The IHO has confirmed that the product does have many medical applications.

Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, outlined the initiative:

« Our goal is to gather sufficient resources for the manufacture of onionhead gamma strain as a medicinal treatment. Target markets will include both independent and Alliance systems, should enough commodities be delivered. »

« We request that pilots transport H.E. suits, polymers and robotics to Crippen Port in the Haithis system. Reimbursements will be arranged by our corporate partner, the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group. »

The Kumo Council has despatched a megaship, the Mictlan, to the Haithis system. A message was broadcast by Archon Delaine, warlord of the Kumo Crew:

« I'm prepared to give this greedy corporation time to reconsider stealing our commercial property. I'm also prepared to massacre everyone in the system. Your choice. »

In response, the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group has agreed to offer bounty vouchers in order to protect ships from pirates and other wanted vessels.


* Torval Orbital Established
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

A new starport has become operational in the LTT 198 system, following Senator Zemina Torval's mining initiative.

Torval Orbital will serve as the administrative headquarters for Torval-Mastopolos Mining. The company successfully competed against Wreaken Corporation to establish a presence within LTT 198.

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, observed:

« Mastopolos Mining should be boasting about the positive start for its new subsidiary. Instead, its reaction has only confirmed the widening rift between the Mastopolos family and their corporation's majority shareholder, Zemina Torval. »

« CEO Gabriella Mastopolos officially distanced herself from the offshoot company, claiming it 'hijacked our name with the intention of luring our clients'. And speaking to Imperial media, both Adrian and Elena Mastopolos criticised Constantia Torval's suitability to act as operations director. »

« Speculation persists as to why the families have become estranged. For now, Zemina Torval seems to be focusing solely on her direct descendants. With her youngest daughter Petra Torval becoming a fellow senator, and grandson Titus Torval promoted to a senior role in Imperial Intelligence, the future seems bright for the Torval dynasty. »


* ACT Scores Victories Against the NMLA
The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has reported progress in its efforts to eliminate the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.

Captain Milo Castile, one of ACT's joint leaders, told a press briefing:

« The recent civil war in the Marlinist Colonies was a tragedy, of course. But many pro-NMLA individuals were exposed during the conflict. Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the newly elected leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, has cooperated fully in rooting out extremists from his faction. »

« As a result, our agents have successfully raided dozens of NMLA cells and arrested several thousand paramilitary activists. We also acquired intelligence leading to hidden assets in multiple systems. »

« I can confirm that Theta Seven \u2013 as the NMLA's de facto leader calls himself \u2013 personally directed the Marlinist starport attacks. Unfortunately, we have yet to confirm Theta Group's current whereabouts. The threat of further bombings cannot be ruled out. »

« The NMLA has also been seriously impacted by the death of Aaron Whyte and the failure to elect a Neo-Marlinist prime consul. Without the legitimacy of a political wing, I believe the terrorists will find it much harder to recruit new allies. »


* Mahon: Sirius Treaty Would Save Aegis
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has commented on the Aegis inquiry and his failed proposal to unify anti-xeno operations.

As part of an interview with The Alliance Tribune, he said:

« The greatest regret of my career is that I was unable to formalise the Sirius Treaty at the Galactic Summit. This would have revolutionised Aegis by providing the commitment and resources it deserves, sparing it the indignity of a public inquiry. »

« The Nine Martyrs attacks prevented that historic occasion, of course, but the Sirius Treaty itself remains viable. I'd be happy to ratify it on behalf of the Alliance if we can convince the other signatories that defending humanity from the Thargoid threat should be our utmost priority. »

Investigators continue to gather information regarding Aegis's operations. There have been further resignations of key staff, and financial records are being independently audited.

Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the board of inquiry, confirmed that charges of criminal negligence could be brought against key figures within Aegis given sufficient evidence. However, there is uncertainty as to which court would deal with legal proceedings for a tri-superpower organisation.


* Archon Delaine Retaliates Against Pharma Giant
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Council has declared war on the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group for the latter's role in supporting Neomedical Industries.

The pharmaceutical corporation's recent campaign in the Haithis system enabled the mass production of onionhead gamma strain, scheduled to be available as a medicinal product from Alliance and independent markets. The drug is currently distributed in a handful of anarchy systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate.

As hostilities erupted in the Haithis system, Archon Delaine broadcast a message for Neomedical Industries:

« Did you truly believe you could steal from us and survive unscathed? Now your allies will pay for your greed with their blood. »

In response, CEO Olwyn Kendrick broadcast a call for help:

« This terrifying attack by the galaxy's most vicious pirates may pressure investors to withdraw, causing the entire project to collapse. If so, the vital materials that pilots delivered will be wasted. To prevent this, we urgently require support for our corporate partners against these criminals. »

The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group is offering rewards to pilots who help protect its ships against pirate assault. The Kumo Council has also offered to reimburse mercenaries who fight on their behalf.


* Neomedical Industries Onionhead Campaign Concludes
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The pharmaceutical megacorp has received sufficient materials to produce onionhead gamma strain as a medical treatment.

Pilots delivered shipments of H.E. suits, polymers and robotics to Crippen Port in the Haithis system. Payment for these deliveries is now available at the starport from the pharma giant's corporate partner, Haithis Purple Dynamic Group.

Bounty vouchers were also offered for all wanted ships, in expectation of pirate attacks coordinated by the Kumo Crew syndicate. Their megaship remains in the Haithis system, which has raised concerns about further retaliation from Archon Delaine.

An announcement was made by Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries:

« Thanks to the sterling contributions, it looks like we are on track to roll out the medically certified strain of onionhead to approximately 15% of all independent systems and Alliance systems  for the 17th of September 3307. It will soon be viewed as a vital healthcare product for millions of people rather than a notorious narcotic. »

There has been some criticism of the Alliance, especially from Federal and Imperial quarters, for allowing the popular psychedelic drug to be sold legally. However, the Assembly reiterated that most Alliance trading laws are enforced on a system by system basis, and that the deal is only there because of the firm assurances and underwriting made by Neomedical Industries.


* Empire Marks Anniversary of NMLA Attacks
A day of mourning has been declared across the Empire to mark the first anniversary of the NMLA's Imperial starport bombings.

On Thursday the 10th of September 3306, Imperial stations in the Cemiess, Gabjaujis, LHS 4031 and Rabh systems were attacked without warning. Over sixty thousand people were killed and twice as many wounded by powerful explosives that delivered a caustic enzyme payload.

The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is an extremist paramilitary group that is dedicated to reforming Marlin Duval's original republican government. Prior to these bombings, it had only performed minor strikes with low casualties.

The NMLA's terror campaign grew to encompass all three superpowers with the Nine Martyrs attacks in March 3307. It also led to supporters of Marlinism fleeing from the Empire as refugees, eventually resettling in the Marlinist Colonies.

Princess Aisling Duval paid respects to the victims during a memorial ceremony at her palace on Emerald. She also spoke of her father Prince Harold Duval, who was assassinated by the NMLA shortly after the bombings.

Messages of condolence have been sent by President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval and First Minister Octavia Volkov. All vowed to continue contributing resources to ACT, which recently shut down many terrorist cells. Coupled with the loss of its political wing, the NMLA threat may finally be diminishing.


* Rebellion Spreads Through the Federation
A further seven Federal factions have severed ties with the superpower in protest against government monitoring of communications.

These latest secessions have been undertaken by minor factions that do not control any systems, including Unktock Free, United Posenoi League and Progressive Party of Inggale.

Political journalist Sofia Trevino reported for The Federal Times:

« Eight factions had previously declared independence from the Federation, and now an even greater number forms the third wave of rebellion. It's clear that their populations feel empowered to take a stand against losing their constitutional rights of privacy. »

« Vice President Archer shrugged off this latest development, maintaining that 'the Proactive Detection Bureau performs a vital security role in these troubled times'. Since none of these latest factions currently govern a system, he may also believe that resistance to the PDB is on the wane. »

« Although these events have only impacted a small part of Federal territory, they remain an embarrassment for President Hudson's administration. Shadow President Winters continues to implore Congress to repeal the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, but she has also taken political criticism since many feel her rhetoric inspired these factions to secede. »


* Salvation Warns of Thargoid Strike
The anonymous figure known as Salvation claims that Thargoid forces will shortly launch an assault in the Cornsar system.

The following message was received by all major newsfeeds:

« This is Salvation. Authorities in the Cornsar system must evacuate the local population immediately. I believe a Thargoid invasion of the system is imminent. »

« I became aware of this danger while developing a new interstellar xeno-detection network, which will be far superior to Eagle Eye. Although the network is not fully complete, we cannot dismiss this report as a false reading. Cornsar must act now. »

Carter Armstrong, a chief administrator with Aegis, delivered an official statement:

« Aegis cannot validate this claim. There is no indication of a Thargoid presence in the vicinity, and Cornsar is too far from their known territories to be a viable target. As most of our operations are suspended due to the public inquiry, we cannot dedicate any resources to investigate further. »

There was also a response from Marshal Noah Sharrow, who governs the Cornsar system on behalf of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party:

« We have no interest in the games of one-upmanship between Aegis and Salvation. Nor do we believe for a moment that the Thargoids would go out of their way to harass us. »


* Thargoid Strike Follows Salvation's Prediction
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Cornsar system has been attacked by Thargoid forces, causing severe damage to two starports.

Direct assaults against Chadwick Port and Ito Market stations have resulted in over ten thousand casualties. Local reports state that Thargoid vessels have also appeared elsewhere throughout the system, placing millions more lives at risk.

The anonymous figure known as Salvation recently warned that Cornsar was in imminent danger of being invaded, having been alerted by his new xeno-detection network. Aegis could not verify Salvation's claim and saw no evidence of any Thargoid presence.

The system's ruler, Marshal Noah Sharrow of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party, transmitted this message:

« This is a call to any pilots in the vicinity of Cornsar. We urgently need ships to defend our people from the Thargoids, and to rescue civilians trapped within Chadwick Port and Ito Market. This is a grave emergency! »

Aegis has released a brief statement:

« We can confirm there is a Thargoid presence in the Cornsar system. Unfortunately most of our operations and personnel remain suspended due to the public inquiry, so we cannot contribute to any anti-xeno efforts. »

There has been no further communication from Salvation, despite his accurate prediction of the attack.


* Pharma Giant Victorious in the Haithis System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group has fought off the Kumo Council assault, securing the completion of Neomedical Industries' onionhead project.

The pharmaceutical corporation had received deliveries to Haithis to begin producing onionhead gamma strain for medicinal purposes. In response, the Kumo Crew syndicate attacked Neomedical's corporate partner but failed to achieve its objectives.

Neomedical Industries confirmed that investment in its project to mass-produce onionhead gamma strain has increased following the conflict's resolution. The news was eagerly received in many Alliance and independent systems, which have expressed interest in the new healthcare treatment.

Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, told the media:

« We owe a huge debt to the galactic community for defending our operation. Large-scale manufacture of onionhead gamma strain can now commence. We will soon be able to improve the quality of life for millions of people. »

The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group is offering rewards to its supporters from Crippen Port in the Haithis system.


* Delta Pavonis Hosts Political Conference
Delegations from the Federation and the dictator Yuri Grom are meeting to determine the Delta Pavonis system's future.

Both are on a diplomatic mission to convince its controlling faction to either swear allegiance to Yuri Grom or become a Federal member state. Delta Pavonis was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord in 2242, but has recently been governed by an independent autocracy.

Yuri Grom himself is present, having arrived on the megaship Indomitable. Grom was once a respected admiral in the Federal Navy, before defecting with huge numbers of ships and followers. They established the independent EG Union, which he presides over as a military dictatorship.

The rival delegation is led by Ambassador Delphine Dumont of the Federal Diplomatic Corps. They were transported on the Freedom's Foundation megaship courtesy of Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar, which formerly controlled the system. The ambassador invited newsfeeds to witness her initial introduction to Yuri Grom, who seemed slightly taken aback by her warm greeting.

Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, ruler of the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis, told attending journalists:

« The conference will take place in Kessler City on Reagan's Legacy, where our distinguished guests will enjoy our famous hospitality. I look forward to learning more about their respective proposals. »

This is the first time that the Federation has diplomatically engaged with Yuri Grom. Political observers noted that this tactful approach may be due to several Federal factions recently declaring independence.


* Thargoids Vanish from Cornsar System
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Thargoid vessels attacking the Cornsar system have unexpectedly departed from the region.

For the last four days, independent pilots and local security forces have been in combat against the alien ships. Although some were destroyed in battle, the remainder have abruptly withdrawn back into hyperspace.

The starports Chadwick Port and Ito Market sustained heavy damage during the assault, leaving thousands dead and wounded. Evacuation efforts are still underway to rescue the survivors from both stations.

Marshal Noah Sharrow, the ruler of Cornsar, made this statement:

« We cannot say why the Thargoids have gone, only that we are grateful they have. I thank all the brave pilots who fought valiantly to defend our people. »

Sightings of crashed Thargoid vessels on planetary bodies in the Cornsar system have been confirmed by Aegis observation teams. As yet there are no official explanations.


* An Heir for Hadrian Duval
Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Augustus Duval, has confirmed that she is expecting a child in December.

The story was broken by the Paresa News Network:

« Lady Astrid was visibly overjoyed as she told us of her pregnancy, and of Hadrian's excitement at being a father. Her only complaint was that she's no longer allowed to fly support missions for Nova Imperium. Once a Commander, always a Commander! »

Mainstream media channels also commented on the news.

The Imperial Herald: « This has caused tangible ripples of unease in the Senate. Since neither Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval nor Princess Aisling Duval have heirs, Hadrian's claim to the throne will be strengthened if he alone ensures that the Duval bloodline continues. »

Eye on Achenar: « Who cares about the spawn of Emperor Hengist's illegitimate grandson? The NMLA may have assassinated much of the Imperial Family, but this outcast boy is still a footnote in their noble history. »

Vox Galactica: « Despite his unofficial status, Hadrian Duval has many silent supporters within the Empire. His isolationist stance appeals to nostalgic citizens, as does returning to the tradition of male Emperors. Should Hadrian have a son, he may feel empowered to seek his birthright more forcefully. »


* Salvation Takes Credit for Repelling Thargoids
The anonymous 'man of science' Salvation has claimed responsibility for the Thargoids' unexplained departure from the Cornsar system.

Salvation had predicted their attack, but his claim was discounted by Aegis and other authorities. After a few days the Thargoid vessels fled abruptly, leaving behind wreckages across the system.

The following message was transmitted on public channels:

« This is Salvation. The Thargoid invasion of Cornsar has now been repulsed, thanks to prototype anti-xeno weaponry that I have been developing for some time. I have achieved what Aegis could not \u2013 an effective deterrent against the alien threat. »

« Refinement of this weapon is at a critical stage, so I cannot reveal any details. I only regret that my warning was not heeded in time to save everyone on the two starports. »

« This triumph was only possible thanks to those loyal pilots who answered my call. Rewards will shortly be available from the Bright Sentinel megaship in the Mbooni system. »

Salvation's identity and capabilities remain unknown, but he has established a reputation as a rival to Aegis. He is also knowledgeable about Azimuth Biochemicals, a research company connected to the earliest recorded encounters with Guardian and Thargoid artefacts.


* Saud Kruger Seeks New Holiday Worlds
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

An initiative to gather data on potential tourist destinations has been launched by shipbuilding corporation Saud Kruger.

The luxury passenger ship manufacturer aims to identify new Earth-like planets that would be attractive to holidaymakers. These trips will be managed by its subsidiary, Astrogator Tours.

CEO Stanislav Kruger announced the campaign to the press:

« We are keen to acquire data on Earth-like worlds, to assess their suitability as destinations for future holidaymakers seeking the adventure of a lifetime. However, all exploration data is valuable and will earn generous payments. »

« In addition, our marketing department is keen to receive images of eye-catching sights found within unpopulated systems containing Earth-like worlds, to spot the most potentially exciting additions to the Astrogator Tours catalogue. »

Vistaenis Incorporated has agreed to organise the initiative on behalf of Saud Kruger. Contributing pilots are invited to deliver exploration data to Youll Port in the Vistaenis system. They can also submit their most compelling images by Thursday the 30th of September.

By Thursday the 28th of October, the most suitable locations will receive tourist beacons and credit the Commander for their submission where appropriate.

If successful, Saud Kruger's Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner ships will be reduced in price for one week from Friday the 1st of October, with the percentage dependent on the volume of data received. There will also be a discount on the luxury-class cabins used by these crafts to transport VIP passengers.


* Progress Between Federation and Yuri Grom
Negotiations between the Federation and self-styled dictator Yuri Grom are underway to determine the Delta Pavonis system's allegiance.

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling published an update for Vox Galactica:

« In recent years, Yuri Grom has developed a degree of mystique. He was one of the few leaders not to attend the Galactic Summit, and news from within his dominion was scarce. But now he is visibly relishing the opportunity to confront Federal representatives under the protection of diplomatic immunity. »

« Initial exchanges were belligerent as both sides argued over who would be the most beneficial partner. This was to be expected since Delta Pavonis is one of the Federation's founding systems, and it would be a significant coup for EG Union to establish a presence so close to Sol. »

« What was unexpected was the mutual respect that gradually developed between Yuri Grom and Ambassador Delphine Dumont. Her charming manner clearly appealed to the dictator, even bringing forth his thunderous laughter on occasion. »

« A deal is now being discussed that would allow the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis to have trade and political ties with both parties while remaining independent. Perhaps the Federation has learned some lessons from the recent rebellion, and perhaps Yuri Grom's hatred of the superpower he once served is finally abating. »


* Salvation: Friend or Foe?
The anonymous Salvation commands much support in the galactic community, but a resistance movement has emerged to sabotage his efforts.

Vox Galactica featured a special report from freelance journalist Alexei Keel:

« In his self-proclaimed war against the Thargoids, Salvation recently scored a major victory by eliminating their forces from the Cornsar system. But the ongoing mystery around the identity of this 'man of science', as well as his controversial methods, have led to a backlash.\

« To deliver vital components for his mysterious anti-xeno weapon, Salvation once again recruited independent pilots, directly messaging those who had performed tasks for him before. However, this time a counter-initiative was formed by those who did not trust his motivations. It was also supported by believers in non-aggression against the Thargoids, and others who feared that the weapon might endanger Cornsar's population. »

« Their actions involved acquiring the components, which were disguised as basic medicines, but destroying rather than delivering them. Whether or not this partial blockade impacted the weapon's effectiveness remains unknown, but it acted as a substantial opposition to Salvation's scheme. »

« Aegis is investigating the Cornsar incident, but with faith in that organisation at an all-time low, individual Commanders are now taking matters into their own hands. Time will tell if Salvation's ambition to replace Aegis is a noble goal, or if we are replacing the devil we know with a darker demon. »


* Galactic Mysteries: Jokers' Deck
Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency discusses the secretive gambling circle attended by the galaxy's wealthiest players.

« Casinos and gaming hubs have always been popular, tempting people to risk their credits for the chance to score a lucrative win. But where do the billionaires and trillionaires go to enjoy that buzz? »

« Jokers' Deck is a highly exclusive gambling event attended only by the rich and powerful. Nobody knows who runs it, only that it's held in a different location each time. Its attendees are guaranteed \u2013 and can afford \u2013 total anonymity. »

« There was one exception. In 3305, Wallglass was hired to find the heiress Lady Talitha Ambrose, after she vanished along with her family's fortune. I was part of the team that discovered she had gambled away 300 billion credits at Jokers' Deck in a high-stakes game of deadlock poker. Their security was so tight that we never learned much more. »

« This year I've been tracking several rumours, such as Jokers' Deck being present at the Galactic Summit and inviting political leaders to settle their differences at the roue mortelle table. But thanks to some costly bribes \u2013 which hopefully I can claim back as expenses \u2013 I've finally got a solid lead. »

« My partner, Francesca Wolfe, and I should have more to reveal soon. With a little luck we will gain a unique insight into this most privileged of gambling dens. Assuming we play our cards right... »


* Yuri Grom Targeted by Federal Strike
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The Delta Pavonis political conference has erupted into conflict between EG Union and Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar.

Yuri Grom, the ruler of EG Union, broadcast this message:

« This conference was nothing more than a trap! My delegation was apprehended at gunpoint by a squad of undercover Federal agents. Sacrifices made by my loyal guards enabled us to escape from Kessler City, only to find our ships under attack. The Federation has declared war \u2013 I will respond in kind! »

President Zachary Hudson gave an official statement:

« Yuri Grom is a traitor and a dangerous threat to Federal security. We cannot ignore any opportunity to eliminate this ruthless tyrant. »

Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar has asked for Federal auxiliaries to provide combat support to its forces. In return, the EG Union called for help from « allies of Yuri Grom and enemies of the Federation ».

Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, the host of the political conference, has rejected claims that his faction was secretly working with the Federation to entrap Yuri Grom. The Federal Diplomatic Corps has not yet commented on its role in these events.


* Saud Kruger Receives Exploration Data
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Enormous amounts of data on Earth-like worlds has been collected for a campaign by shipbuilding firm Saud Kruger.

The data is highly valuable to the corporation's subsidiary, Astrogator Tours, which runs holiday cruises across the galaxy and is seeking new locations.

The initiative was declared a success by CEO Stanislav Kruger:

« Not only have we received data about highly promising systems, but many creative Commanders provided imagery guaranteed to entice adventure-seekers to these new worlds. We are deeply grateful to all pilots who took part. »

Vistaenis Incorporated, Saud Kruger's partner in this initiative, is now offering payment for the exploration data at Youll Port in the Vistaenis system.

Tourist beacons will be added to the most suitable systems by Thursday the 28th of October, which will record for posterity the names of the pilots who submitted the most compelling images.

As a result of the initiative, a discount of 15% will be applied to sales of all Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner ships from the 1st of October, alongside a reduction in cost for the luxury-class cabins which can be installed in any of Saud Kruger's vessels.


* Torval Loses Control of Mastopolos Mining
Senator Zemina Torval has relinquished her long-held position as Mastopolos Mining's majority shareholder.

Official reports confirmed that the board of directors passed a resolution to remove Zemina Torval from their number. Over half of her shares were then sold, thereby drastically reducing her personal influence on the corporation.

An anonymous insider gave a statement to The Imperial Herald:

« Gabriella Mastopolos made it crystal clear to the other shareholders that it was time to topple Zemina Torval from her perch. But what surprised them was Torval's lack of resistance to this pressure\u2026 almost as if she had been planning to step down all along. »

« I've heard that every credit made by selling the shares went straight into the subsidiary that her daughter is running. So maybe all her eggs are going into that basket? »

In related news Constantia Torval, operations director for Torval-Mastopolos Mining, made an announcement:

« I am proud to announce that the people of LTT 198 have elected Torval-Mastopolos Mining to replace LTT 198 State Ltd as their controlling authority. Permits to gain entry to the system can be earned via the Pride of Bitterwood megaship, which remains in the nearby EGM 559 system. »


* Ambassador Condemns Entrapment of Yuri Grom
The Federal Diplomatic Corps has officially denounced President Hudson's attempt to capture Yuri Grom in the Delta Pavonis system.

The political conference was to determine whether the system's ruling faction would ally with the EG Union or the Federation. It was abandoned when a Federal black ops team attempted to arrest Yuri Grom's delegation, triggering a conflict in the system.

Ambassador Delphine Dumont told The Federal Times:

« We have no option but to state that our own government has violated the conventions of diplomatic immunity. This conference was established in good faith with all parties. We were not informed that any hostile act against EG Union was planned. »

« I offer my personal apologies to Yuri Grom. Our negotiations were spirited but honest, and I genuinely felt that progress was being made. »

This is the first time that the Federal Diplomatic Corps has distanced itself from the actions of a sitting president. Political observers believe that this is to maintain its reputation for integrity, especially in dealings with the Alliance and Empire.

Public reaction in the Federation has been varied, with President Zachary Hudson being praised and criticised in equal measure. Insiders within his administration suggest that he is under enormous pressure to regain popularity, following the recent rebellion of several Federal systems.


* An Undercover Report on Jokers' Deck
Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provides an inside view of the Jokers' Deck gambling circle.

« Gunnarson's intel was correct. The latest host is multi-billionaire investor Lexi October, the lady who rescued Supratech from bankruptcy. We're in one of October Consortium's disused warehouse complexes, which looks derelict on the outside but is a fabulous glittering palace within. I don't actually know what planet I'm on, since all the servants \u2013 including me with my fake ID \u2013 were transported here in total secrecy. »

« Jokers' Deck is exactly what you'd expect of a luxury casino for the super-rich. Exquisite food, sumptuous clothes, and dozens of games from deadlock poker to Giant Verrix racing. Wagers are made using billion-credit chips, precious gemstones and even land deeds to an entire continent. And that's not counting the VIP rooms that I can't get into. »

« I've served exotic drinks to several famous faces, such as Duchess Rouncival and Scorpio DeVorrow. I've seen Senator Leatrix talking earnestly to Ambassador Rochester about a princess they both know. Arch-Corsairs Trask and Volantyne from the Kumo Council are here, taking on Zachary Rackham at the roue mortelle tables. And there's no mistaking the voice of Alliance megastar Xiona whenever she wins big. »

« Oh, and who should walk in just now but\u2026 wait, I can hear an alarm. Looks like a security alert. Damn it, have they detected me? I should \u2013  »

The message was published by Erik Gunnarson, who added this coda:

« I've heard nothing more from Wolfe since receiving this, and she didn't check in at a scheduled rendezvous point. I've decided to share her report as a warning to Jokers' Deck. If anything happens to her, just remember we know who you are. »


* Twin Initiatives for Colonia Bridge Project
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems aim to improve journeys to the distant colonies.

The Colonia Bridge project is being funded by Brewer Corporation, which outlined the details in a press release:

« The Colonia region has great potential for businesses and travellers, but the long voyage can be prohibitive. Brewer Corporation is investing in the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia, to make crossing those thousands of light years easier. »

« Up to 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the route to Colonia, providing travellers with valuable respite and resources including tritium. These stationary megaships should be operational by the 28th of October, and will mark the completion of the first phase of the three-phase Colonia Bridge project. Its aim is to place dockable megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the Alcor and Colonia systems. »

« To achieve this, we require large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units. These can be delivered to either Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system or Jaques Station in the Colonia system. »

The Colonia Council is subsidising part of the initiative, due to the importance of this enterprise. As a consequence, the commodity requirements for the megaships at Jaques Station are reduced.

Brewer Corporation has confirmed that as well as offering payment for the materials, it will ask the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia to submit potential names for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.

As an added incentive, there will be temporary discounts on purchasing and outfitting fleet carriers at both Macdonald Settlement and Jacques Station, based on pilots' contributions.


* Yuri Grom Victorious Against Federation
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The battle between Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar and EG Union has concluded successfully for Yuri Grom's forces.

Freelance war correspondent Karleen Troy reported via Vox Galactica:

« For the past week, the Delta Pavonis system has been aflame with ship-to-ship engagements. But despite a fierce effort from Federal auxiliaries, EG Union was able to muster superior numbers. »

« Eventually the Federal flagship, Freedom's Foundation, was boarded. I picked up comms chatter that described intense fighting before EG Union soldiers overran Federal troops. Since then I've learned that Yuri Grom has agreed to let the surviving crewmembers leave, but is claiming the megaship as 'spoils of war'. »

The following message was sent by Yuri Grom on public channels:

« President Hudson has revealed his true nature as the corrupt heart of the Federation's rotting carcass. This treachery will not be forgotten. »

Pilots who supported Yuri Grom can collect their rewards from the Indomitable megaship. Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar confirmed that although the Freedom's Foundation is now under EG Union control, reimbursement for all Commanders who fought for Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar will be processed remotely by the 9th of October 3307.


* Corporate Split between Mastopolos and Torval
Senator Zemina Torval's company Torval-Mastopolos Mining has become fully independent from its parent corporation.

The former subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining has officially rebranded itself as Torval Mining Ltd. Zemina Torval is listed as its CEO, with her eldest daughter remaining as operations director. The starport Torval Orbital in the LTT 198 system serves as the company's headquarters.

Business correspondent Anton Lagorio reported for The Imperial Herald:

« Although Torval Mining Ltd is now an independent company, shares are legally transferable between it and Mastopolos Mining. This has allowed loyal supporters of both Zemina Torval and Gabriella Mastopolos to flock to each other's banner. As a result, Torval Mining Ltd has acquired many ships, staff and resources from its former parent. »

« There have been assurances that the split was amicable and in line with Imperial traditions of honourable conduct. Constantia Torval has promised customers that mining and transportation services would be maintained to the same high standard. »

« Speculation continues over what caused this unexpected rift between the Torval and Mastopolos families. It seems that Zemina Torval is focusing on providing benefits for her own children and grandchildren, rather than her cousins on the Mastopolos side, but the reason for this change of heart remains unclear. »


* Jokers' Deck Hit by Art Thief
The secretive gambling circle of the super-rich has been raided by the notorious criminal known only as the Winking Cat.

The information was revealed by Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency, who infiltrated the event. Her report, which was relayed from an unidentified location, has been published by her fellow detective Erik Gunnarson.

« I'm not sure this will reach Gunnarson, but I must try. After the security alert the staff started getting their IDs checked, which might have revealed mine to be fake. I managed to slip out of the warehouse and into an abandoned industrial district. I still don't know what planet I'm on, but I've found an old comms transmitter to send this message. »

« Before I escaped, I learned what had caused the alert. There was a VIP ceremony involving the group's most precious possession: an ancient Joker playing card. Apparently this has been passed between senior members of Jokers' Deck for centuries, always held by the current host. But when Lexi October publicly unveiled the card, she found it had been replaced by one showing a different graphic \u2013 a winking cat. »

« It's two years since we've heard from the galaxy's greatest larcenist, but there's no doubt that only the Winking Cat's legendary skills could have circumvented their security systems. I'm fascinated that a battered scrap of card has greater value than any of the billion-credit items being wagered here. »

« Guards are searching for the thief now. I hope I can get off-world before they find me instead. They're armed to the teeth and not in the mood to talk\u2026 »


* Federal Terrorist Network Exposed
The Proactive Detection Bureau has been instrumental in identifying violent corporatist extremists within the Federation.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the Federal Intelligence Agency gave a statement to the media:

« In recent weeks, our surveillance algorithms flagged a series of coded communications for investigation. We found that a network of radicalised citizens were discussing plans to assassinate members of Congress and leading political figures. »

« This movement, which calls itself Jupiter's Wrath, is inspired by Jupiter Rochester's failed attempt to enable corporations to directly rule the Federation. Their goal was to enact revenge on those who they consider to be the 'enemies of Jupiter Division'. »

« Using data intercepted by the Proactive Detection Bureau, FIA agents performed a series of coordinated strikes in several Federal systems. Over a thousand armed extremists were arrested before they could act. We are currently working to identify the remaining Jupiter's Wrath members. »

Vice President Jerome Archer claimed that this was further validation of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, which permitted the PDB to be established. However, Shadow President Felicia Winters commented:

« I commend the FIA for performing their duties. But I also question the timing of this operation, coming so soon after President Hudson's appallingly reckless attempt to capture Yuri Grom. To me it seems calculated to show his administration in a positive light, while ignoring the violation of citizens' privacy. »


* Orion University Claims Ownership of Dredger
The ancient spacefaring home of the Scriveners Clan is the legal property of Orion University, according to newfound historical records.

The Scriveners Clan is a nomadic tribe travelling onboard a self-sufficient Dredger-class bulk cruiser. Their society is descended from an academic organisation that sent out a research fleet two centuries ago. Unlike some dredger clans, they refuse to have any contact with outsiders.

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew of Orion University made this statement:

« In the year 3088, Dredger J-403 was commissioned for an exploration mission by an academic institute named Scrivener College. This was absorbed into our university in 3125. Documents detailing these facts were recently discovered in our archives and verified by the courts. »

« Therefore the dredger, including all of its contents, is legally owned by Orion University. Naturally we bear no ill will toward its current populace, but the vessel they inhabit has always been our commercial property. »

The Scriveners Clan dredger was last seen in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, where it was salvaging the Hesperus megaship. On the 9th of July it made a hyperspace jump to an unknown destination within 500 light years.

Orion University is the largest independent educational institution in the core systems, rivalled only by the Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village University.


* Terrorist Attack at Hadrian Duval's HQ
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Explosions have struck Dyson City starport in the Paresa system, home of Hadrian Duval's organisation Nova Imperium.

The starport suffered severe structural damage plus the corrosive effects of caustic enzymes, characteristic of the customised weapons used by the NMLA. Initial reports state that over fifteen thousand people have been killed and a similar number injured.

The following statement was issued by Praetor Leo Magnus, the former head of security for Nova Imperium who was seconded to ACT:

« Shortly before this attack, my team intercepted a communication between suspected Neo-Marlinist supporters. This referred to an imminent attempt to kill Imperator Hadrian Duval, Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval and their unborn child. »

« I immediately ordered the Praetorian Guard to move the Imperator's family off-station, which was achieved minutes before the bombs detonated. I am pleased to report that they survived this brutal attack, but unfortunately the remaining population could not have been evacuated in time. »

A state of emergency has been declared in the Paresa system, with an urgent request for independent pilots to assist with rescuing survivors from Dyson City starport.

The Empire confirmed that as per the Treaty of Paresa, it will provide military and medical support to Nova Imperium. ACT is performing investigations to learn more about the attack.


* Colonia Bridge Project Receives Deliveries
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Twin initiatives in the Alcor and Colonia systems have procured materials to construct new dockable megaships.

Brewer Corporation made an announcement regarding its Colonia Bridge project:

« A positive response has led to generous shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units being received. As a result, Brewer Corporation can now commence work on enhancing the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and the Colonia region. »

« Thanks to the dedication of the galactic community, 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the Colonia Bridge route by the 28th of October. These will serve as stationary ports, providing vital facilities for travellers. Planning is already underway for the second phase of this project, placing further megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the Alcor and Colonia systems. »

« Payment for contributing pilots is now available at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. Both starports also offer a temporary discount on purchasing and outfitting to owners of our Drake-class Carriers. »

Brewer Corporation will soon be reaching out to the top ten pilots from both the Alcor and Colonia initiatives, to provide naming suggestions for the dockable megaships being placed on the route to Colonia. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.


* Orion University Searches for Dredger
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Rewards are being offered by Orion University to locate the Scriveners Clan dredger, which it claims as its legal property.

The self-sustaining Dredger-class bulk cruiser was launched two centuries ago by an academic institute that was later absorbed by the university. Since then the dredger has become the home for a nomadic tribe called the Scriveners Clan, which refuses contact with all outsiders.

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew told the media:

« Orion University is willing to reward pilots who can pinpoint the dredger's current location. We believe it is still within 500 light years of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system. »

« Pilots who are interested in helping should first dock at Ring Mine station in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, to automatically sign up to the search operation. Our associates at the starport, Deep Space Mining, will provide further information including details of the reward. »


* NMLA Aims to 'Extinguish the Duval Line'
The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army has taken responsibility for the attack on Dyson City starport in the Paresa system.

The primary targets were Imperator Hadrian Duval and his wife Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, who is pregnant with his child. Although they survived, the bombing left many thousands dead and injured.

The following message was sent across NMLA propaganda channels:

« As long as a single Duval is left alive, the Republic of Achenar cannot be rebuilt. It is our duty to extinguish that entire line and free our people from Imperial oppression. »

Praetor Leo Magnus gave a statement on behalf of ACT:

« It is significant that this latest broadcast is not from Theta Seven, the NMLA's mouthpiece and de facto leader. We believe that Theta Group \u2013 the team of weaponsmiths that built the caustic enzyme bombs \u2013 has split in two. »

« According to the communications we intercepted, Theta Seven and half of his followers went into hiding after the attacks against the Marlinist Colonies in July. The others continued their terror campaign and were responsible for this latest atrocity. ACT is currently pursuing leads and hopes to learn more soon. »

Nova Imperium has repeated a call for pilots to help rescue survivors from Dyson City in the Paresa system.


* Scriveners Clan Dredger Located
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

The dredger inhabited by the nomadic Scriveners Clan has been found within the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system.

Independent pilots conducted a search for the vessel in response to a request from Orion University, which claims that the Dredger-class bulk cruiser is its commercial property.

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew announced the operation's success:

« Congratulations to the pilots who managed to locate Dredger J-403. The university will shortly dispatch a megaship to take ownership and arrange repatriation for its current occupants. »

The dredger is currently orbiting an ice world in the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system. It is believed to be collecting raw material from planetary rings to sustain its onboard systems, a design feature that allows it to remain self-sufficient indefinitely.

There has been no communication with the Scriveners Clan, the spacefaring tribe descended from an academic institute that was later absorbed into Orion University. It is known that they shun contact with all outsiders to protect their Knowledge Core, a repository of research conducted over the past two centuries.


* Jokers' Deck Hunts the Winking Cat
Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency has sent a final report from her infiltration of the secretive gambling circle.

« The bad news is that Jokers' Deck security caught up with me as I was trying to sneak onboard a ship to get off-planet. The good news is that they didn't gun me down, or even threaten to press charges. Instead, they offered me a job! »

« Lexi October, the current host, was surprisingly gracious. Turns out she's a fan of the Galactic Mysteries pieces that Gunnarson and I run, but more importantly, she believes we could give her what she really wants \u2013 the Winking Cat. »

« She explained that the Joker playing card that was stolen is hugely symbolic to the group, having belonged to its original founder. She also assured me that Jokers' Deck is extremely private but not criminal. Its members sign legal waivers, and there is a strict honour code to ensure all bets are paid. »

« So, Lexi October wants to hire us to track down the infamous Winking Cat thief and retrieve the ceremonial playing card. This may also be a way for her to save face with her fellow super-rich gamblers, who are understandably unhappy about the exposure. »

Erik Gunnarson, Wolfe's detective partner, added:

« It's a huge relief that Wolfe is safe, but what has she got us into now? Will we really be able to catch the Winking Cat? I wouldn't bet on it. »


* Federal Agents Crush Jupiter Division Extremists
A pro-corporatist group planning a series of terror attacks has been shut down by the Federal Intelligence Agency.

An update on the operation was delivered by Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the Proactive Detection Bureau:

« Special forces have now arrested the organisers of the underground organisation called Jupiter's Wrath. This was a collection of citizens radicalised by Jupiter Rochester into believing that they could replace democratically elected leaders with corporate overlords. »

« This successful operation was only possible thanks to information provided by the PDB. Without this surveillance network, we would be entirely unaware of Jupiter's Wrath and many leading politicians may have lost their lives. »

« Our analysts are now updating the PDB's algorithms to highlight citizens who are at risk of radicalisation. We will prevent domestic terrorism by identifying those being corrupted by hostile ideologies. »

In response, Congressman Bai Zheng was quoted in The Federal Times:

« This is an unnerving development in the PDB's evolution. It's also what many of us in Congress feared. We are not targeting people who have committed a crime, but people whose personal opinions are unpalatable to the government. »


* Torval Mining Ltd Requests Resources
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Senator Zemina Torval's new corporation requires deliveries of commodities to its megaship in the EGM 559 system.

Constantia Torval, the senator's daughter and operations director of the company, provided details of the initiative:

« Now that we are a fully independent business, additional resources are urgently needed to continue providing services to the Empire. My goal is to ensure that the Torval name remains synonymous with efficiency and dedication. »

« Shipments of geological equipment, microbial furnaces and mineral extractors can be delivered to the megaship Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system. From there, they will be transferred to our headquarters at Torval Orbital in LTT 198. »

The Pride of Bitterwood is part of a corporate fleet recently purchased by Torval Mining Ltd. Most are currently in the LTT 198 system being outfitted for mining and transport operations. Business analysts believe that these megaships were funded by Zemina Torval after selling the majority of her shares in Mastopolos Mining.


* Scriveners Clan Resists Orion University
The spacefaring tribe that lives aboard an ancient dredger has refused to allow Orion University to take possession of the vessel.

Vox Galactica published an eye-witness account by freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick from the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system:

« Once the Scriveners Clan was found, it wasn't long before Orion University arrived. Their megaship, Scientia Aeterna, remotely disabled the dredger's hyperdrive using a series of override codes. These had been unearthed from the university's archives, along with evidence that the ship \u2013 commissioned in 3088 as Dredger J-403 \u2013 legally belongs to them. »

« Despite being unable to escape, the Scriveners have made a stand. All requests to communicate were roundly ignored. I've watched several craft try to dock with the dredger, only to be met with sealed airlocks and an electrified hull. »

« It's clear that these people are unwilling to give up their home simply because of centuries-old legislation. But it's also apparent that Orion University is interested in more than just reclaiming lost property\u2026 »

« The Scriveners possess something that they refer to as a Knowledge Core, which contains everything that this scholarly society has learned during its long voyage. What discoveries might this database contain? And how far will the university go to get their hands on it? »


* Senators Offer to Protect Hadrian Duval
The recent NMLA attack in the Paresa system has encouraged the Imperial Senate to reach out to Imperator Hadrian Duval.

An official pronouncement was made by Senator Caspian Leopold:

« A majority of us believe that preserving the Duval bloodline is paramount for the future of the Empire. Hadrian Duval is not officially a member of the Imperial Family but he is the grandson of Emperor Hengist, meaning his as-yet unborn child is also of royal lineage. »

« The NMLA has already murdered many Duvals, including Prince Harold. Indeed, Hadrian himself barely survived an assassination attempt last year. It's clear that the Empire can provide greater security than he currently has, and it is our duty to do so. »

« Therefore, we propose making both Hadrian and Lady Astrid wards of the Senate. They will be placed under the highest level of protection, at least until this grave threat has abated. »

Imperator Hadrian Duval is currently holding discussions with a delegation from the Senate. Political observers believe that their proposal may be conditional on him severing ties with Nova Imperium, an isolationist organisation that was once outlawed in the Empire.

Independent newsfeeds have speculated that since the NMLA's terror campaign began, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has been under similar senatorial protection and performing her duties from a secure location.


* Alliance and Marlinists Address Refugee Crisis
The Marlinist Colonies have offered to provide help for political refugees who sought sanctuary in Alliance space.

In 3306, the Empire's security forces began arresting followers of Marlinism, suspecting them of being linked to the NMLA. Many pro-republican Imperial citizens fled to the Federation, but some set course for the Alliance instead.

The situation has been highlighted by Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate:

« Having made a desperate journey for survival, over a million Marlinists are now dispersed across Alliance territory. Most are clustered in small groups, lacking basic supplies and facing extreme deprivation. Some Alliance systems have offered citizenship, but others are attempting to expel them as illegal immigrants. »

« The Empire wishes to repatriate these people, which means harsh interrogation for some and lifelong persecution for others. I hope to negotiate with the Alliance to arrange an alternative \u2013 transportation to the Marlinist Colonies. There they will be welcomed into the democratic society established by their brethren. »

Ambassador Elijah Beck, head of the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations, has agreed to meet with Prime Consul Tau to examine solutions. The Imperial Diplomatic Corps officially refused an invitation to join this discussion.


* Thargoid Fleets Invade Nebula Systems
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Several inhabited systems in the Pleiades and Witch Head Nebulas have come under attack by large numbers of Thargoid ships.

An emergency has been declared by the authorities in multiple systems including Asterope, Shenve and Onoros. Thargoid vessels have again targeted starports, with casualties estimated in the many thousands.

Increased Thargoid activity has also been reported in the California and Coalsack Nebulas. Independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons are moving to defend the invaded systems and evacuate survivors from damaged starports.

Aegis is not currently able to assist, as the operational shutdown enforced by the public inquiry has led to many ships and pilots being withdrawn from service. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison to Aegis, commented:

« Many of us in Aegis are frustrated that the Baumann Report has tied our hands. I am also convinced that these Thargoids are reacting aggressively to the weapon of mass destruction that Salvation deployed in the Cornsar system. Not only should we be fighting the alien threat, but Salvation must be prevented from escalating the war. »

The Taurus Mining Ventures megaship Bright Sentinel has moved to the Merope system at Salvation's request. Reports indicate that tech brokers on board are offering a Guardian-hybrid plasma charger as well as material cost discounts to support the anti-xeno effort.


* Resources Boost for Torval Mining Ltd
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Vital materials have been delivered to the EGM 559 system to sustain Senator Zemina Torval's new corporation.

The megaship Pride of Bitterwood received multiple shipments of geological equipment, microbial furnaces and mineral extractors. These will be transferred to Torval Orbital in the LTT 198 system, supplying the starport acting as the primary base of operations for Torval's new venture.

Operations director Constantia Torval announced the campaign's conclusion:

« All of us here at Torval Mining Ltd are pleased with the contributions. These supplies will ensure that we meet our first year's targets and continue providing high-quality services to our customers in the Empire. »

Torval Mining Ltd was originally a subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining, but became autonomous following a rift between Zemina Torval and her cousins in the Mastopolos family. The two corporations are now commercial rivals in the Empire's industrial mining market.

The megaships Champion of Commerce and The House Ascendant have recently jumped to the Laguz and 21 Eridani systems, respectively. These vessels represent part of the corporate fleet recently purchased by Torval Mining Ltd.


* Initial Stage of Colonia Bridge Operational
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Thirty megaships have been placed between the core systems and the Colonia region to serve as stationary ports.

Twenty-five dockable megaships were sent out from the Alcor system toward Colonia, taking position in systems approximately 400 to 500 light years apart. Five further megaships have been established from the direction of the Colonia system.

Each vessel serves as a permanent way station for travellers and businesses, designed to improve the journey to and from Colonia. A variety of services are provided, including tritium refuelling for Drake-class fleet carriers.

The Colonia Bridge is the product of Brewer Corporation, which ran a highly successful deliveries campaign to collect resources. The megacorp has confirmed that phase two of this project will commence next week.

During the creation of the Colonia Bridge, the crew aboard the stationary megaship Memories of Oresrati in the Snake Sector OD-S b4-2 system reported an unusual incident. A distorted transmission that could have been an SOS was detected on long-range sensors. Although they were unable to triangulate its source, the signal strength suggested a point of origin within 50 light years.


* The View from Colonia
Vox Galactica's culture correspondent Lishan Abara looks at the Colonia region, the largest enclave of humanity outside the core systems:

« Colonia. A place that few ever see, which exists following a computer malfunction. The famed Jaques Station suffered a mis-jump on its scheduled journey to Beagle Point, relocating some 22,000 light years from Sol. The subsequent rescue effort led to the establishment of the first permanent base in what is now considered a new frontier for humanity. »

« Over the last five years, courageous explorers have struck out to inhabit several dozen local systems. This, in turn, invited a steady stream of colonists seeking a fresh start. Nearly 13 million souls now count this remote area as their home. »

« This is a place beyond the influence of the superpowers and mega-corporations, and most residents prefer it that way. The Colonia Council works hard to maintain order, helping local organisations function along cooperative lines. There have been a handful of regional conflicts, but generally you're less likely to witness trouble out here. »

« Having become self-sufficient early on, Colonia's healthy economy encourages both traders and tourists to make the long journey. The scientific community maintains a notable presence, a notable example is the Holloway Bioscience Institute, which studies the many vacuum-dwelling life forms found in the Colonia Nebula. »

« Independent and faction-aligned pilots are catered to, with shipyards and even a fleet carrier construction dock found in the area. Local engineers such as Baltanos, Eleanor Bresa, Rosa Dayette and Yi Shen also offer suit and personal equipment modifications to those who make a living working on low-atmosphere worlds. »

« With the Colonia Bridge project well underway, it will soon be easier than ever to cross the interstellar gulf and reach this distant haven. Businesses, settlers and visitors alike may find themselves increasingly drawn to the Colonia experience. »


* Advocacy Defends Dredger Clan
The Scriveners Clan's legal ownership of their dredger has been supported by the civil rights organisation Advocacy.

The ancient Dredger-class bulk cruiser, currently located in the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system, is inhabited by a nomadic tribe descended from the vessel's original crew. Orion University claims that the cruiser is its commercial property, but has failed to make contact with its occupants.

Rhiannon Grady, director of Advocacy, explained:

« For centuries, there has been widespread legislation to protect remote communities from cultural contamination. These laws apply to micro-societies, such as those found aboard generation ships, that evolved in isolation. »

« Therefore, Orion University should not presume to deprive over ten thousand people of the only home they have ever known. Unlike cases such as the Golconda, which requested emergency assistance, in this case we are legally and morally obliged to respect the status quo. »

Professor Elizabeth Perez, head of anthropology at Orion University, responded:

« I was involved with the Golconda aid efforts, and fully appreciate the delicacy of this situation. But the dredger's age and condition makes it a hazardous environment for its people. Evacuation should be considered for their own safety, with appropriate measures to minimise cultural disruption. »

The university's megaship, Scientia Aeterna, has halted attempts to gain access to the Scriveners Clan dredger. However, it has not withdrawn its remote override of the vessel's hyperdrive.


* Hadrian Duval Accepts Senate Protection
The Empire has officially proclaimed Hadrian Augustus Duval and his wife Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval to be wards of the Senate.

The offer of senatorial protection was made following an NMLA attempt to assassinate them and their unborn child by bombing Dyson City starport.

Prior to being transported from the Paresa system to a secure location, Hadrian Duval sent this message:

« Lady Astrid and I accepted this offer with enormous reluctance. Neither of us wish to abandon our home or loyal followers. Yet we feel it is a matter of duty to protect our family and ensure future generations of the Duval bloodline. »

« Nova Imperium will henceforth be known as Nova Paresa. It will continue to serve as a staunch ally of the Empire, as per the Treaty of Paresa. To all those who fought for our cause over the years, I assure you that history will never forget us. Memento Mordanticus! »

There has been public support for Praetor Leo Magnus to assume leadership of Nova Paresa. Hadrian Duval has endorsed his former head of security taking his place, but confirmed that the title of Imperator is now defunct.

In related news, ACT stated that its investigation into the Dyson City attack has yielded results. Although details remain embargoed for security reasons, a significant breakthrough is expected to be announced soon.


* Demands for Federal Rebellion Decline
Many factions have seceded from the Federation in recent months, but recent polls suggest the likelihood of further withdrawals is waning.

The Federal Times published an update on the situation by political correspondent Sofia Trevino:

« Some negative reaction to the Proactive Detection Bureau was anticipated. But it's unlikely that Congress foresaw nearly forty systems abandoning the Federal Accord, as their governing factions declared independence. »

« Fears that this would spiral into mass rebellion now seem misplaced, however. This is partly thanks to the PDB's recent role in preventing Jupiter's Wrath from committing terrorist acts. Although that group is hardly in the NMLA's league, evidence that communications surveillance can save lives seems to have convinced some Federal citizens to reconsider their opposition. »

« President Hudson's efforts against the breakaway factions were hailed by his supporters and decried by his opponents. But the Federal Diplomatic Corps remain displeased that Hudson suffered no repercussions for violating diplomatic immunity when attempting to capture Yuri Grom. »

« Shadow President Winters continues to call for the PDB to be shut down to prevent the Federation from becoming an authoritarian police state. But many accuse her rhetoric on civil liberties to have triggered the secessions in the first place. »

« Meanwhile, many Federal factions are carefully observing those who did become independent. Their future success or failure may well determine whether or not this rebellion continues. »


* Colonia Bridge Project Enters Phase Two
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Brewer Corporation requests deliveries in the Alcor and Colonia systems for the next phase of the Colonia Bridge project.

A successful initiative in October resulted in the placement of 30 dockable megaships at intervals of several hundred light years, providing services such as refuelling and repairs. The second phase seeks to establish this support for the full route between the core systems and the Colonia region.

A press release from Brewer Corporation stated:

« We are now ready to continue work on the Colonia Bridge, by constructing additional megaships to fill the middle of the planned route. As before, we require shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system or Jaques Station in the Colonia system. »

« Should deliveries reach sufficient levels, the top 75% of contributors will be awarded an engineered frame shift drive with increased range and faster boot sequence. Our hope is that this encourages deep space explorers and long-distance haulers to take part in the Colonia Bridge project. »

As an additional reward, the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.


* Aegis Leader Opposes Salvation
Admiral Aden Tanner has called for Aegis to reject the public inquiry's shutdown and take direct action against Salvation.

The Musashi, an Aegis Defense megaship under his command, has entered the T Tauri system to challenge Taurus Mining Ventures. The corporation has performed activities on Salvation's behalf, including preparation for the anti-xeno weapon used to eliminate all Thargoids from the Cornsar system.

Admiral Tanner transmitted this message to media outlets:

« Salvation's unlicensed weapons technology is deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives. My sources tell me that Hind Mine asteroid base contains evidence of this. I therefore demand that Taurus Mining Ventures allows us access so we can determine the truth. »

Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures responded:

« We are a legitimate business under contract to a private citizen, whose activities are protected by confidentiality agreements. These threats have no legal standing and are not welcome. »

Admiral Tanner is a highly decorated Federal Navy officer and Aegis's chief military liaison, having coordinated many combat efforts against the Thargoids. The Musashi's relocation has been condemned by Aegis leadership, and Tanner has been ordered to depart the T Tauri system.


* ACT Captures Theta Group
The creators of the NMLA's caustic enzyme bombs have been arrested, although the terrorist figurehead Theta Seven remains at large.

Theta Group is directly responsible for 17 starport bombings conducted by the NMLA across the core systems. These attacks resulted in a combined death toll of almost 800,000 people, with twice as many suffering serious injury.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit's co-leaders, told the media:

« We have finally tracked down the NMLA's bomb-making engineers, and a joint task force made the arrest with minimal casualties. Large quantities of Thargoid corrosives and explosive components were also seized. »

« This achievement was only possible due to intercepting Theta Group's communications with Neo-Marlinist sympathisers. We are unsure why the NMLA's dark-comms network was not used in that instance. »

« As our intel predicted, the group's leader Theta Seven was not among those we captured. We have confirmed that he and a handful of followers disappeared after the bombings in July, anticipating their imminent capture. ACT will not rest until the galaxy's most wanted terrorist has been brought to justice. »

The name 'Theta Group' was assigned to the bomb-makers during their incarceration at Serene Harbour, an Imperial Intelligence penal facility in the R CrA Sector AF-A d42 system. After escaping, their leader adopted his prisoner designation \u2013 Theta Seven \u2013 as a reaction to what he viewed as dehumanising treatment of Neo-Marlinists by the Empire.


* No Progress with Dredger Deadlock
The nomadic Scriveners Clan continues to resist Orion University's attempts to take possession of their dredger.

Freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick published an update from the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system:

« Orion University's claim that the vessel is their property has been countered by Advocacy's reminder of laws preventing cultural contamination. So the question now is: who actually owns the dredger? Is it the families that have lived there for generations, or the organisation which originally built it? »

« Various solutions have been proposed to resolve this stand-off. These include an offer from Canonn Interstellar Research Group to purchase the dredger from Orion University, gift it to the Scriveners Clan then publicly share the contents of their mysterious Knowledge Core. »

« However, two centuries of isolation have instilled this academia-focused society with a pathological need to protect its research. They are no more likely to cooperate than a deeply religious nation asked to hand over its most holy artefact. »

« Orion's megaship Scientia Aeterna is still transmitting requests to communicate. I have even seen one of its secondary craft narrowly avoid being consumed by the dredger's maw while searching for an access point. But the Scriveners are locked down tight, and this siege situation shows no sign of ending. »


* Long-Lost Research Facility Discovered
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

A distress call has led independent pilots to locate an abandoned settlement in the Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 system.

The SOS was initially detected by one of the megaships that form the Colonia Bridge, inspiring many ships to search nearby systems. The source was eventually identified as Holloway Bioscience Research Facility 15 on the moon Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 AB 5 b.

Pilots unearthed a series of mission logs recorded in the year 3255 by a freelance military unit named Excalibur Troop. As yet, the contents of these logs have not been made available to newsfeeds.

Aanya Gupta, CEO of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, gave a statement to the press:

« Research Facility 15 was one of the first wave of planetary survey laboratories established by our founder, the esteemed scientist Lord Roland Holloway. Our records of these settlements are patchy, so we are grateful that this has been located. »

« Unfortunately, we can find no data regarding Excalibur Troop or the circumstances under which they were contracted. Our investigative teams are on-site to gather further information. »

The Holloway Bioscience Institute refused to comment on rumours that a previously unidentified life form had been encountered by the research facility's original crew.


* Aegis Renegades Attack Salvation's Allies
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A rogue Aegis Defense force has initiated conflict with Taurus Mining Ventures in the T Tauri system.

The megaship Musashi is commanded by Aegis's chief military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner, who made this announcement:

« The Hind Mine asteroid base contains proof that Salvation's unlicensed anti-xeno weapon is intentionally designed to provoke the Thargoids, and therefore endangers us all. As Taurus Mining Ventures refuses to cooperate, we have no choice but to obtain the evidence by force. »

« This may be our only opportunity to discover Salvation's true ambitions. I urge all independent pilots who have fought alongside Aegis to help us complete this vital mission. »

Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, responded:

« This is an illegal attack that jeopardises the important work we are undertaking on behalf of Salvation. It is in the galactic community's interests to defend our corporate headquarters. »

Aegis officially stated that Admiral Tanner is acting on his own authority, and that the Musashi's presence in the T Tauri system is in direct violation of orders. Despite this, there are reports that Tanner has tacit support from many members of Aegis, who disagree with the public inquiry that has suspended its operations.


* Colonia Bridge Gains Further Resources
*Pilots Federation ALERT*

Successful campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will result in new megaships being added to the Colonia Bridge.

Large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were provided at either end of the route between the core systems and the distant Colonia region.

Brewer Corporation provided an update on the project:

« Once again, the galactic community has provided the vital materials required to construct dockable megaships. These additional ports should be operational by the 25th of November, making journeys to and from Colonia easier and safer. »

« Pilots can now collect their rewards from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. We shall also be awarding an engineered frame shift drive with long range and fast boot to the majority of contributors. »

The top ten pilots who delivered materials to Alcor and Colonia will shortly be invited to submit suggestions to name the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.


* Manhunt for Theta Seven Escalates
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has acquired an encrypted message that may reveal Theta Seven's location.

ACT successfully captured most of the bomb-making engineers known as Theta Group, and has now prioritised hunting down the NMLA's de facto leader.

This latest breakthrough was explained by Captain Milo Castile:

« Theta Group managed to delete most of their data prior to capture, but we retrieved a short message that they received on the 31st of July. At this point most of Theta Group were being harboured by Neo-Marlinist sympathisers within the Marlinist Colonies, but Theta Seven and his closest aides had fled to an unknown destination. »

« Unfortunately the message has been encrypted using a pre-arranged cipher key, without which its contents are unreadable. It is unclear why this wasn't transmitted via the NMLA's dark-comms network, which remains undetectable despite our best efforts. »

« As it's possible that this was sent by Theta Seven, we welcome any assistance from the galactic community in decoding it. This ruthless terrorist must be tracked down before he can take more innocent lives. »

ACT has requested that all newsfeeds publish the encrypted message, which is as follows:

61-76-126-67-99-74-71-113-81-41-96-103-51-117-55-103-91-69-104-117-84-114-141-134-90-108-90-79-115-95-102-102-98-76-91-57-83-104-92-99-96-78-79-83-132-115-80-106-91-150-114-105-148-144-93-163-83-138-123-94-108-115-81-128-147-162-131-140-150-129-29-98-99-59-74-125-55-123-107-112-98-108-82-91-124-71-75-111-109-95-129-89-155-135-98-131-149-97-151-105-152-152-144-128-155-64-81-123-89-90-87-96-59-116-127-52-94-103-51-89-51-47-98-88-61-112-112-111-129-147-124-153-134-109-87-114-121-80-90-113-111-153-131-84-104-131-84-151-113-129-130-117-105-123-73-99-126-106-118-144-97-83-123-104-75-78-90-49

There is a substantial reward on offer for the first person to submit a correctly deciphered version of this message to ACT.


* Dredger Clan Faces Possible Extinction
Orion University has been informed that its ownership claim of the Scriveners Clan dredger is placing its population at great risk.

In the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system, the university's megaship Scientia Aeterna has used override codes to prevent the dredger from departing. But the nomadic tribe's refusal to abandon their home has placed them under great pressure, as observed by freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick:

« Dredger-class bulk cruisers are the sharks of space \u2013 they must always keep moving, constantly gathering raw materials to synthesize into fuel, air and other resources. The Scriveners Clan remained stationary for months while salvaging the Hesperus, but in this system they are trapped without such vital intakes. »

« Independent observers are now reporting malfunctions in the vessel's power and life support systems. If the Scriveners maintain their siege mentality, further mechanical failures are inevitable. Orion might inherit the dredger after all, but it will be a ship of the dead. »

Professor Elizabeth Perez, Orion University's head of anthropology, responded:

« The last thing we wish is for any harm to befall these people. My colleagues are urgently discussing ways to convince the Scriveners Clan that we have their best interests at heart. After all, as fellow scientists and researchers, they are a living embodiment of our university's core values. »


* Theta Seven Traced to Panjabell System
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A decrypted message suggests that the NMLA leader Theta Seven avoided capture by infiltrating the Far God cult.

ACT publicly requested help to decode a message received by Theta Group, the bomb-making engineers of the NMLA. The cipher key was cracked and the decoded message submitted by Commander Therion Cygni. It revealed that Theta Seven and his closest aides fled to the Panjabell system on the 31st of July.

Captain Milo Castile, one of ACT's co-leaders, provided an update:

« Our theory is that Theta Seven and his crew were travelling undercover as Far God worshippers, who were gathering in the Panjabell system in huge numbers at that time. Since all members of this religious order renounce their past identities, this would have helped the terrorists to avoid detection. »

« The Pleiades Concordat and other factions in Panjabell are cooperating with our investigation. But it seems likely that Theta Seven is currently hiding aboard one of the three Far God megaships that were launched from the system on the 6th of August. »

« ACT agents have attempted to contact the Perdition, Sacrosanct and Testament megaships to alert them of the danger. Unfortunately the cultists consider themselves to be on a sacred pilgrimage that cannot be impeded, and that their vessels are 'sanctuaries from further persecution by hostile security services'. »


* NMLA Retakes the Steel Majesty
A former Neo-Marlinist megaship has been overrun by NMLA terrorists in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.

The Steel Majesty was originally owned by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, one of the NMLA's key allies. After their defeat, it ferried many of them to the Marlinist Colonies where they were granted asylum by Minister Aaron Whyte. His faction then made use of the megaship during the civil war in August.

Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the current leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, gave a statement:

« Despite our efforts to arrest any remaining extremists within our faction, a surviving group has gained access to the megaship. Security feeds show they were joined by several teams of well-armed NMLA fighters. »

« The Marlinist Constabulary evacuated around half of the Steel Majesty's crew before the NMLA took operational control. Sadly, there is no way to free those still trapped onboard. »

The situation was addressed by ACT's co-leader Captain Milo Castile:

« According to our intel, a majority of the NMLA's surviving cells have gathered together for this operation. We believe they were assisted by not only Aaron Whyte's loyalists, but also members of the megaship's original crew from the Mudhrid system. »

« It is possible that this Neo-Marlinist coalition was formed as a result of us closing in on Theta Seven. We have requested additional support from all security services. »


* Dredger Deadlock Inspires Competing Campaigns
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The HIP 43670 system is hosting two competing delivery initiatives, each of which aims to benefit the Scriveners Clan.

Orion University has partnered with Independent HIP 43670 Labour, which is requesting deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670.

The university's campaign was explained by Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew:

« Although Dredger J-403 is legally our property, what we value most is the Scriveners Clan's dedication to deep-space research. To convince them of our noble intentions, we are donating scientific data and samples to their Knowledge Core. Our proposal is that they permit us to accompany them on their journey and share in any future discoveries. »

An alternative campaign is also taking place in the HIP 43670 system. Supporters of the Scriveners Clan are being asked to gather emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses and deliver them to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson told the media:

« These supplies are needed to perform vital repairs to the dredger. Furthermore, if the power systems are sufficiently updated, they can bypass the ancient components affected by Orion University's override codes and continue travelling independently. »

Although there remains no response from the Scriveners Clan, the dredger is now actively monitoring all local and interstellar transmissions. This is a new development for the isolated community, and suggests they are aware of these campaigns.


* Salvation's Allies Triumph in T Tauri System
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Taurus Mining Ventures has defeated a rogue Aegis Defense force and gained control of the megaship Musashi.

The conflict was initiated by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis. He was attempting to gain access to Hind Mine asteroid base, in search of evidence that Salvation's anti-xeno weapon was deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids.

Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, made this announcement:

« This was an illegal and unnecessary conflict, brought about by Admiral Tanner's misguided obsession. We will continue working with Salvation to eliminate the Thargoid threat. »

« Our defence was only possible thanks to our courageous supporters, for whom rewards are available at Hind Mine. We will also honour agreements that the Aegis Defense force made with independent pilots, who can collect their promised payments from the Musashi. »

Taurus Mining Ventures later confirmed that all members of the Musashi's original crew will be allowed to leave the megaship unharmed. Admiral Tanner and other key personnel are in temporary custody. Aegis has arranged for them to be transferred to its internal security teams.


* Colonia Bridge Project Faces Possible Changes
Brewer Corporation is enhancing the travel corridor to Colonia, but details about the project's next phase remain uncertain.

Business-related newsfeed The Tau Ceti Journal published this feature:

« There's no doubt that Brewer Corporation always thinks big. It has enjoyed huge commercial success as a manufacturer of starports and outposts, and its Drake-class fleet carrier has been enormously popular. »

« The Colonia Bridge is the megacorp's most expensive undertaking yet, investing hundreds of billions of credits on the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia. More than one analyst predicted that the project might financially destabilise them. »

« The first two phases proceeded on schedule. Before the end of this month, there will be a chain of 56 stationary megaships along systems between Alcor and Colonia. »

« But there are rumours of a change of plans for phase three, which may be early next year. It is believed that Brewer Corporation is revising its plans based on the unexpectedly high levels of participation from the galactic community. »

« In support of this, one company insider did reveal that more engineered frame shift drives are being manufactured, to be offered as incentives to contributing pilots in the third phase. »


* Neo-Marlinist Forces Gather in Mudhrid
The megaship Steel Majesty has arrived in the Mudhrid system after being taken over by NMLA terrorists.

Its original owning faction, the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, has officially reclaimed the vessel. Margrave Corentin Delacroix, the faction's new military ruler and the son of former Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, announced:

« The Steel Majesty has returned home to fulfil its destiny. Be warned: should any ships attempt to board or attack, all the former crewmembers still onboard will be executed. »

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez gave a statement on behalf of ACT:

« Unfortunately, we cannot take action while hundreds of innocent people remain captive. But the NMLA's effort to assemble troops, supporters and resources must not succeed. Having the Steel Majesty as a mobile base will allow them to regroup for a new campaign of terror \u2013 especially if they manage to reach Theta Seven before we do. »

A spokesperson for the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group, which controls the Mudhrid system, claimed:

« The hostages should be considered lost as casualties of war. We are prepared to perform our duty for the Empire once again by destroying the Neo-Marlinist threat. »


* Crime Wave Raises Security Concerns
An expert larcenist known as the Winking Cat has triggered widespread alarm with a spree of high-profile thefts.

Vox Galactica published this feature by crime correspondent Mira Bukowski :

« Last month, the galaxy's most infamous thief reappeared in the headlines after a long absence. It appears the Winking Cat is making up for lost time by stealing multiple items in quick succession. »

« One notable target was a portrait of Emperor Olban Hensard Duval, the tenth ruler of the Empire. Painted in 2989, it was notable for being seven metres high - as was the graphic of a smirking feline face engraved on the wall where it once hung. »

« Another disappearance, albeit of a less artistic nature, was the only working prototype of Achilles Corporation's XS1001 security robot. This was being guarded by several XS801 models which, according to insiders, were found lying on their sides and emitting an unusual 'purring' sound. »

« There are reports of several other rare or precious artefacts disappearing from secure locations. In all cases, there are no clues as to how security systems were circumvented. »

« The Wallglass Investigations Agency has theorised that the Winking Cat may not be an individual after all, but a group of criminal specialists working together. They also suspect that these latest thefts may be intended for some larger purpose. »


* Gatekeeper Megaships Established
Factions responsible for the distribution of conditional access permits have deployed so-called Gatekeeper megaships to neighbouring systems.

The agreement between 14 factions intends to allow permit distribution procedures to continue regardless of the political status of the associated systems. Though the reason for system access restrictions varies between the factions, preventing any disruption to interstellar trade was a key factor in the talks.

A spokesperson for Alioth Independents, one of the factions involved, offered the following:

« It is rare that so many participants from across the core systems are able to reach an agreement so easily. These megaships will ensure that the flow of traffic within our respective borders remains appropriately controlled, providing support for the permit offices in those systems. »

« Only a few short years ago, the system of Tiliala saw disruption in assigning permits to eligible visitors due to political disturbances. The Panjabell system experienced this problem again within recent months. These lessons have inspired us to prevent further repetitions in the future. »

« I would like to thank each faction representative for their contributions to maintaining consistency in our methods for the ease of pilots, recognising the valuable contributions they make to the galactic economy. »

Permit distribution to eligible recipients will still be carried out remotely.


* Far God Megaship Hijacked by Theta Seven
NMLA figurehead Theta Seven has taken control of the Sacrosanct megaship and redirected it to the Mudhrid system.

Several months ago, the leader of Theta Group and his closest aides evaded capture by posing as members of the Far God cult. One of their pilgrimage vessels, the Sacrosanct, has now bypassed its scheduled flight plan and jumped to Mudhrid.

ACT's joint leader Captain Milo Castile broadcast an emergency statement:

« We can confirm that despite being few in number, the terrorists are in command of the Sacrosanct. Since Far God worshippers are pacifists and fatalistic in nature, it's likely that they offered little resistance. »

« Theta Seven has stated that he will wipe out the vessel's entire population if any attempt to seize the vessel is made. Our intel suggests he possesses caustic enzyme explosives of the type used in the starport bombings, making his threat credible. »

Also in the system is the Steel Majesty megaship, recently overtaken by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. ACT believes that the NMLA is regrouping its forces and aims to provide protection for Theta Seven.

Mudhrid's ruling faction, the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group, has ordered system security to shoot down any vessels attempting to pass between the two megaships.


* The Battle of Mudhrid
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group have declared war in the Mudhrid system.

The Steel Majesty megaship is serving as the base of the Neo-Marlinist forces. These include many surviving NMLA terrorist cells that gathered to overtake the vessel from the Marlinist Colonies.

Also in the system is the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct, where the NMLA's de facto leader Theta Seven and the remnants of Theta Group have been in hiding for months. They recently took control of the vessel and are holding thousands of cultists hostage.

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid have offered a uniquely augmented enzyme missile rack to its highest contributors if certain objectives are met. Margrave Corentin Delacroix broadcast a call to arms:

« All those who seek to topple the Duval dictators must fight alongside us here and now. Neo-Marlinism has no future unless its believers defend it. »

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group is orchestrating its campaign from Payne-Scott City starport. Senator Denton Patreus has requested that Imperial auxiliaries provide the faction with combat support.

ACT's co-leader Captain Saskia Landau stated:

« The NMLA clearly places huge value on Theta Seven's ability to produce caustic enzyme weapons, and has risked concentrating in large numbers to defend him. If he can transfer to the Steel Majesty and escape, the threat of further atrocities like the Nine Martyrs bombings will remain high. »


* Dredger Clan Freed from Orion University
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Scriveners Clan dredger has been fully repaired, following twin initiatives in the HIP 43670 system.

A campaign by supporters of the Scriveners Clan delivered emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson for the group announced:

« As a result of our efforts, the dredger has received sufficient supplies to effect repairs. Most importantly, the new power systems mean it will shortly be able to bypass Orion University's override codes and be free to travel the galaxy once more. »

A parallel campaign by Orion University's partner Independent HIP 43670 Labour requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670. However, these were not sufficient to convince the nomadic tribe to agree to its offer of sharing future discoveries.

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew expressed his regret, but confirmed that Orion University will honour the outcome and withdraw its claim over the dredger.

Contributors to both initiatives can now collect their rewards from Shaara Gateway or Oramus Terminal in the HIP 43670 system.


* Colonia Bridge Project Extended to 3308
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The second phase of the Colonia Bridge project is complete, with Brewer Corporation confirming details for phase three.

An additional 26 megaships have taken up stationary positions in systems between Alcor and Colonia. Along with the existing 30 megaships, these will provide convenient rest, refuel and repair facilities to those travelling to and from the distant Colonia region.

A press release from Brewer Corporation addressed the next steps:

« The galactic community has made enormous contributions to establishing the Colonia Bridge. Encouraged by this, we have revised our plans and increased investment in the project. »

« The next phase is scheduled to commence on the 6th of January 3308, and will add starports to key locations along the route. These will provide further services and opportunities to pilots, as well as forming permanent micro-communities between the core systems and Colonia. »

« Phase three will also address the availability of tritium, to improve refuelling capacity for owners of our Drake-class fleet carriers. To incentivise the delivery of vital materials, we will be offering the same engineered frame shift drives that proved so popular during phase two. »


* Aegis Renegades Face Criminal Charges
Admiral Aden Tanner and the crew of the Musashi megaship will be placed on trial for attacking Salvation's allies.

The admiral disobeyed orders by attempting to gain access to Hind Mine starport, the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures. After failing to achieve this, most of the Musashi's crewmembers were detained and repatriated to their respective home systems to face civil or military charges.

The Federal Navy has published this official notice:

« Admiral Tanner is formally accused of mutiny and unlawful military action while in command of the Musashi. He will stand trial in a general court-martial. If found guilty, he will be dishonourably discharged and imprisoned for life. »

Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry into Aegis, commented:

« Recent events in the T Tauri system clearly fall within the scope of our investigation. For Aegis's chief military liaison to launch an unauthorised attack, at the cost of many lives, will weigh heavily against the organisation. »

Admiral Tanner claims that the anti-xeno superweapon deployed by Salvation in the Cornsar system has triggered an increase in Thargoid attacks. Although there is no direct evidence of this, the Thargoids have performed coordinated strikes against several systems in the weeks since that event.


* Thargoid Invasion of Nebula Systems Intensifies
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Systems in the California, Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head Nebulas are under sustained assault by the Thargoids.

Vox Galactica featured this report from freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios:

« Multiple starports have been crippled by Thargoid attacks in recent weeks, with anti-xeno squadrons struggling to protect them. Many Commanders told me that this latest wave is proving unusually difficult to repel, with a steady stream of reinforcements replacing those alien vessels destroyed in battle. »

« In normal times Aegis would coordinate the defence effort, but its operations remain suspended due to the Baumann inquiry. Today, it is clear that many of the superpowers' leaders have more faith in Salvation after his triumph in the Cornsar system, believing that he holds the key to defeating the Thargoids. »

« Both the Imperial Navy and the Alliance's Council of Admirals have suggested committing naval forces to support Salvation. In the Federation, Congress has debated redirecting funds that were ring-fenced for Aegis to accelerate development of the anti-xeno superweapon. »

« As yet these are merely discussions, but do illustrate the wide-reaching impact of the Cornsar incident. In the meantime, in the absence of direct support from either Aegis or Salvation, pilots are sacrificing their lives as they fight courageously to push back the Thargoid fleets. »


* Empire Celebrates Newborn Duval
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A new chapter in the Duval family's history has begun with the birth of Hadrian Augustus Duval's son.

The announcement was made by The Imperial Herald:

« Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Duval, has delivered a baby boy at an undisclosed secure location while under senatorial protection. »

« The child has been named Hector Mordanticus Duval. This is in honour of Hadrian's late father Hector Jansen, who was Emperor Hengist's illegitimate son, as well as Imperator Kaeso Mordanticus, who played a major role in both Hadrian and Astrid's lives. »

« Despite Hadrian not being an official member of the Imperial Family, many citizens are jubilant at the arrival of a new Duval. The Imperial Palace, Princess Aisling Duval and Chancellor Anders Blaine have all sent messages of congratulation. »

Praetor Leo Magnus, who was Hadrian Duval's head of security, has resigned his temporary commission from ACT to assume leadership of Nova Paresa. The faction has organised an initiative to gather rare commodities for its former leader to celebrate the historic occasion.

Pilots are asked to deliver Chateau De Aegaeon, HR 7221 Wheat, Indi Bourbon and Yaso Kondi Leaf to Dyson City in the Paresa system. All shipments will be subject to security scanning before being redirected to a suitable location.


* Battle of Mudhrid Ends in NMLA Defeat
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid has been defeated by the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group in the Mudhrid system.

With the aid of many independent pilots, the Imperial faction outmatched the NMLA-supporting forces who were attempting to rescue their leader Theta Seven.

Captain Saskia Landau provided an update from ACT:

« Using the fierce fighting as cover, Captain Milo Castile led a commando unit made up of specialists from Alliance, Federal and Imperial security forces to gain access to the Steel Majesty. After freeing and arming the crewmembers that were being held hostage, they overpowered the NMLA troops and retook the megaship. »

« We have successfully prevented Theta Seven and his followers from rejoining their fellow terrorists. But the Far God cult's vessel, the Sacrosanct, is still in the system under his control. Until the man responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths has been captured, our victory over the NMLA remains incomplete. »

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group stated that those who supported its campaign can now receive their rewards from Payne-Scott City starport.

The Imperial faction also agreed that independent pilots who fought for the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid will be permitted to collect payment from the Steel Majesty, which has been transferred to their ownership.


* Dredger Clan Resumes Nomadic Travels
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Scriveners Clan dredger has departed from the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system to an unknown destination.

Freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick provided a report for Vox Galactica:

« After a coalition of supporters helped them to bypass Orion University's override codes, the Scriveners Clan has finally resumed their nomadic lifestyle. To its credit, the university has finally taken stock of public opinion and agreed not to pursue its ownership claims over the ancient dredger. »

« Many in the scientific community have pointed out that the contents of the Knowledge Core, around which the Scriveners' entire culture is based, will now remain a mystery. There are rumours that this tribe of academic researchers have acquired data about the Guardians during their decades of wandering, which was perhaps the real prize sought by Orion University. »

« Concerns have also been raised about the Scriveners' chances of survival if they encounter hostile forces. Had the Scientia Aeterna megaship been allowed to accompany the dredger, it could have offered protection or at least called for assistance. Now that the Scriveners Clan have resumed a solitary existence, their fate is once again entirely in their hands. »


* Standoff for ACT and Theta Seven
Terrorist ringleader Theta Seven is defying capture by holding thousands of Far God cultists hostage in the Mudhrid system.

Vox Galactica published an on-the-scene report from freelance journalist Redmond O'Hara:

« Although the NMLA has been defeated in Mudhrid, the Theta Group bomb-makers remain in control of the Sacrosanct megaship. With so many lives at stake, ACT has focused all its efforts to resolve this tense situation. »

« We've heard that Senior Agent Ramirez and Inspector Klatt have both tried to open negotiations directly with Theta Seven. It is hard to imagine what they might offer him in terms of clemency, but they're obviously determined to prevent further deaths at the NMLA's hands. »

« After speaking to one of ACT's tactical advisors, I can reveal that Captain Castile's commando unit tried and failed to board the Sacrosanct as it did the Steel Majesty. This is apparently because the vessel is specially modified to prevent external access, in order to provide the Far God cultists with a sanctified environment during their pilgrimage. »

« Speaking of the cultists, they may not have accepted their predicament quite as passively as expected. Internal power failures detected within the Sacrosanct's hyperdrive systems may well be a result of sabotage, and would explain why it hasn't left the Mudhrid system. Perhaps in their own way, the Thargoid-worshippers are seeking justice for those murdered by Theta Seven's appropriation of their deity's 'holy' caustic enzymes. »


* Vodel Releases Scorpion SRV
SRV manufacturer Vodel today announced the official release of its new vehicle, the Scorpion.

The first new mass-production model offered by the company in many years, the Scorpion is designed for combat operations and troop support. It is widely understood that Vodel's acquisition by Core Dynamics in 3305 triggered the development of the new model, with the parent company's considerable financial resources made available to Vodel's engineering teams.

Vodel's chief of design, Frank Endis, gave a speech at the company's launch event at Levinson Orbital in Bhattra:

« We are delighted to bring the Scorpion SRV to the market and are excited at its potential. Our marketing team anticipates huge interest from independent operatives and military forces alike, thanks to the Scorpion's impressive specifications. »

« A focus on survivability provides the Scorpion's two-crew cabin with additional protection from harm. The plasma surge repeater and the proprietary Aculeus missile launcher work in perfect harmony when engaging shielded, armoured targets. Meanwhile, the Scorpion's raw power offers exceptional torque, capable of handling harsh terrain and steep climbs. »

Core Dynamics CEO Owen McKenna also attended the event and was approached for comment:

« I'm really happy with how hard the Vodel team has worked on this new vehicle. They had clear goals in mind from the start, took Core Dynamics' feedback on board and kept us updated regularly through the process. I think the acquisition of Vodel was one of the last good decisions Jupiter Rochester made as head of the company. »

The Scorpion SRV is now available to purchase from military economy ports.


* Support Salvation's Counterstrike Against the Thargoids
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Salvation requires vital materials to deploy anti-xeno superweapons in the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems.

A message was transmitted from the Musashi megaship by its new commanding officer, Commodore Morag Halloran:

« The Thargoids have invaded three key systems, as Salvation anticipated. Preparations have been made to halt their advance, but there is an urgent requirement to collect classified experimental equipment from the Heart of Taurus in the Qarato system. »

« Pilots must then deliver these shipments to three other megaships: the Musashi in the Delphi system, the Bright Sentinel in the Maia system, and the Glorious Prospect in the Merope system. »

« It is crucial that all deliveries are made by early on Tuesday the 14th of December. Without these components, Salvation's superweapons will not be able to affect enough Thargoid vessels to turn the tide. »

Commodore Halloran was formerly a member of the Alliance Defence Force, and was in charge of protecting the first expedition to the Coalsack Nebula in 3306. She is one of hundreds of naval officers and crew from all three superpowers who have resigned their commissions to offer their services to Salvation, believing that only he can defeat the Thargoids.


* Tributes Gathered to Honour Duval Heir
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The birth of Hadrian Duval's son has been celebrated in grand fashion in the Paresa system.

Praetor Leo Magnus, the new leader of Nova Paresa, publicly thanked pilots for delivering Chateau De Aegaeon, HR 7221 Wheat, Indi Bourbon and Yaso Kondi Leaf to support these highly exclusive proceedings. Payment is now available from Dyson City starport.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho discussed the arrival of Hector Mordanticus Duval in The Imperial Herald:

« As Emperor Hengist's illegitimate grandson and former enemy of the state, Hadrian Duval has always been the outsider. Indeed, his newborn son's middle name seems deliberately chosen to remind the Emperor that she ordered Hadrian's mentor, Imperator Mordanticus, to be shot in cold blood. »

« But over the last two years, Hadrian's position has gradually shifted from isolationist rebel to legitimised ally. He appeals to citizens who are unhappy with a female monarch, even more so now that he has a male heir. And he remains closest to the Imperial bloodline, with most other Duval family members having been assassinated by the NMLA. »

« Therefore, unless Arissa Lavigny-Duval or Aisling Duval produce children, it's entirely possible that Hadrian's child might inherit the throne. Despite only being a few days old, Hector Duval's impact upon the Empire could be measured in centuries. »


* Intrigue Surrounds Recovered Art Treasure
Recent evidence suggests that some of the precious items stolen by the Winking Cat have been sold to private collectors.

Crime correspondent Mira Bukowski has been following the story for Vox Galactica:

« When the FIA raided the home of media magnate Elias Metaxas, they found the painting Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke hanging in his chambers \u2013 a painting stolen by the Winking Cat in 3305. Metaxas confessed to purchasing the famous artwork for 22 billion credits via a series of anonymous dealers, none of whom could be traced. »

« Coincidentally, there are rumours that an Imperial senator keeps some statues resembling the missing New Dawn collection hidden within her mountainside chalet. And only recently, multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham was overheard inviting an investor to 'come up and see my Guernica'. »

« It seems that the thief has secretly sold these highly valuable treasures to private collectors. However, this is not typical behaviour for someone believed to be a genuine connoisseur of fine art as well as a skilled larcenist. »

« Perhaps there is an urgent need for huge sums of money, and since the Winking Cat has never stolen anything as vulgar as mere credits, this is the most ideal method. But what might the notorious criminal be planning? »


* The Death of Theta Seven
The NMLA's de facto leader and his closest followers have sacrificed themselves by destroying the Far God cult's megaship Sacrosanct.

The hijacked vessel had been taken to the Mudhrid system by the remaining members of Theta Group, aiming to reunite with the NMLA. After this failed, ACT forces surrounded the Sacrosanct in the hope of rescuing the several thousand cultists being kept as hostages.

Theta Seven broadcast a short video message, where he uttered a single phrase:

« The future will remember us. »

He was then seen to manually detonate a series of bombs, which ruptured the Sacrosanct's hull and split the vessel in two. It is believed that the weapons also distributed Thargoid caustic enzymes throughout the megaship, thereby killing its entire population.

ACT has released a statement from co-leader Captain Saskia Landau:

« Tragically we were unable to save the lives of the Far God worshippers, despite several attempts to negotiate their safe conduct off the ship. Captain Castile's commando unit could not gain entry to the Sacrosanct in time, and we had no success trying to hack into its onboard computers. »

« We can confirm that the most wanted terrorist in the galaxy is dead. But ACT's task is not yet complete, since there is much we still don't know about the NMLA. Our investigation will focus on learning more about their background, as well as targeting any surviving cells of activists. »


* Thargoids Repulsed from Three Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons have cleared most Thargoid vessels from the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems.

Pilots were asked to transport classified experimental equipment from the Heart of Taurus in the Qarato system to three other megaships owned by Taurus Mining Ventures. These components were used to prepare the large-scale weapons developed by Salvation to affect Thargoid technology.

Vox Galactica published an intercepted message from Commodore Morag Halloran, commanding officer of the Musashi, to the Bright Sentinel and Glorious Prospect megaships:

« This is Halloran. Operation Tri-hammer has concluded with a code white-three-alpha. Estimated target destruction in Delphi is at 27%, with full dispersal of 98% of remaining hostiles. Scans underway for non-combatant disruption or casualties. Maia and Merope data to be submitted immediately to central analytics. »

Independent observers have reported that the majority of all Thargoid ships in the three systems have abruptly departed, with some wreckages found on planetary surfaces. This closely matches the event in the Cornsar system in September, when the anti-xeno superweapon was first deployed.

Pilots are requested to help with repair and rescue efforts for starports damaged by the Thargoids: Donar's Oak and The Oracle in the Delphi system, Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system, and Reed's Rest in the Merope system.


* The Triumph of Salvation
Salvation has confirmed that his anti-xeno superweapons successfully routed Thargoids from the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems.

The following message was submitted to all newsfeeds:

« The Thargoid spearhead into human space has been severely blunted. Commodore Halloran coordinated the operation with military precision, and many loyal pilots acted swiftly to provide components for my unique technology. »

« At present, I am not able to deploy these weapons in other systems suffering alien infestation. Next year, we will deliver a decisive blow in the war against the Thargoids. »

« I urge the peoples of the galaxy to unite behind my crusade. Aegis is finished. I am the only remaining defence for humanity. I am Salvation. »

Independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons have been asked to continue combating the remaining Thargoid vessels in the Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head Nebula regions. Repair efforts are also still required in the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems.


* NMLA Megaship Becomes Marlinist Flagship
The megaship Steel Majesty has travelled from Mudhrid to the HIP 22550 system and been renamed as Fairfax Vision.

The Wells-class carrier was originally owned by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and used as a base for the NMLA terrorist group. After a military defeat, the vessel's crew sought political asylum in the Marlinist Colonies.

The Steel Majesty later became the hub for Minister Aaron Whyte's followers during the Marlinist Civil War. More recently, NMLA activists retook the ship and unsuccessfully tried to rescue their leader Theta Seven.

The Marlin Standard published this statement from First Minister Octavia Volkov:

« I am delighted that the Marlinist Consulate has negotiated with the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group to arrange for this megaship to be returned to us. We are renaming it in honour of my predecessor Dr Jenna Fairfax, who led millions to safety after our mass exodus from the Empire. »

« The Fairfax Vision is now controlled by the Free Marlinists of Carinae faction, but will represent the colonies' parliamentary and diplomatic interests abroad. I hope that true Marlinism, and our progressive republican society, can now flourish peacefully. »


* A Gift From a Thief
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Detective Erik Gunnarson has claimed that the Winking Cat thief has something planned for the weeks ahead.

« After our investigation into the Jokers' Deck gambling circle, Wolfe and I were hired to track down their stolen ceremonial playing card. The good news is that we now have the card in our possession. We can hardly claim credit, however: it was posted to us by the one who stole it! »

« The ancient joker card arrived via a courier service, with no data as to its point of origin. But the playing card now has text stamped on the back, which I'm convinced is intended to be a public message. »

« It simply reads 'The hunt is on!' and is followed by two sets of numbers:

'1, 2, 3: 16th to 30th'

'4, 5, 6: 23rd to 6th'.

At the bottom is a drawing of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a smirking, winking cat's face. »

« It's speculation, of course, but some of these numbers must be dates. Perhaps this 'hunt' is scheduled to happen over the next three weeks. Are we being invited to hunt the Winking Cat, or will something else be the prize? »

« The feline thief has been busy of late, purloining everything from prized artwork to prototype robots. Entertainment mogul Oscar Goldsun recently reported that his private collection of rarities had been hit, and there are rumours that WorldCraft corporation's vaults were somehow broken into. How that crime spree connects to this message is a mystery that we've yet to crack. »


* Salvation Recruits Naval Crews
The recent counterstrike against the Thargoids has revealed that Salvation is being unofficially supported by trained military personnel.

Commodore Morag Halloran was a senior officer with the Alliance Defence Force who is now working for Salvation. She sent this statement to the media:

« Over the last few years, I have fought hard to protect Allied interests from the Thargoids. But every battle against them felt like a defensive measure, a holding action. I'm convinced that these creatures are more than capable of wiping us all out. »

« When an entire Thargoid fleet was forced out of the Cornsar system in September, I approached the Council of Admirals about sending ships to help, but my proposal was rejected. Then Salvation contacted me directly, saying that he required military leadership and my experiences in the Coalsack Nebula made me an ideal candidate. »

« Along with Lieutenant Commander Glynn and nearly a hundred crewmates, we resigned our commissions and headed for Hind Mine. I now command many others who were recruited from the Federal, Imperial and Sirius Navies to serve on the Taurus megaships and elsewhere. »

« I'm aware that some will view my actions as dereliction of duty, but I believe our true duty is to stop the Thargoids at any cost. And as our recent success proves, only Salvation has the means of doing so. »

The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have all acknowledged the loss of some military personnel to Salvation's cause. While efforts are being made to prevent further losses, it is rumoured that potential concessions include official support for Salvation's anti-xeno activities.

* Theta Seven's Identity Discovered
ACT has revealed the background of the man known only as Theta Seven, the NMLA's de facto leader who recently died in the Mudhrid system.

Captain Saskia Landau gave this statement to the media:

« A combination of investigative work and interrogating NMLA survivors has allowed us to confirm that Theta Seven's real name was John Tyburn. He was born and raised in the city of Fontaine on the planet Baltah'Sine, where he was a munitions technician constructing demolition charges for commercial mining. »

« There is evidence that Tyburn was always a vocal believer in Marlinism, and became a pro-democracy campaigner. This eventually caused him to lose his job and serve a prison sentence for sedition. His Imperial citizenship was revoked, his marriage annulled and his children taken into state care. »

« Upon release, Tyburn was contacted by the NMLA and radicalised to the Neo-Marlinist cause. He produced portable explosives for terrorist actions, and rose rapidly in their ranks. »

« It was Tyburn's proposal to develop caustic enzyme bombs capable of damaging a starport, but his experimentation on these weapons resulted in injuries and corrosive scarring. They only became a reality following a workable design commissioned from the engineer Liz Ryder without her knowledge of its purpose. »

First Minister Octavia Volkov of the Marlinist Colonies commented:

« It's unsettling to learn that this arch-terrorist grew up in the same place as I did and had similar experiences. John Tyburn might easily have been my fellow refugee from the Empire, or perhaps helped us form our republican society. This does not excuse his crimes, but it's all too clear how political persecution can give rise to monsters. »


* GalNet: Unauthorised Messages
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The editorial team at GalNet would like to apologise for the recent articles originating from an unofficial source.

On the 17th, 18th and 19th of December, our publication network transmitted text messages of unknown origin. These articles were not officially commissioned or approved, and should not have been available via GalNet channels.

GalNet formally apologises to all Commanders for this unprecedented disruption to our regular service.

As yet we have no explanation as to how these illicit transmissions were inserted into our regular feeds. Our technical teams are currently investigating, and we are confident that this situation will not reoccur.


* Thargoid Presence Persists in Multiple Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head nebulas continue to see an influx of Thargoid vessels.

Freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios reported for Vox Galactica:

« Over the last few months, Thargoid ships have appeared in over two dozen populated systems including Shenve, Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5 and Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6.  All are in the vicinity of nebulas, which seem to be favoured by the Thargoids. »

« In some systems, organised task forces of independent pilots have successfully hunted and destroyed the invaders. But in others, their efforts are undone by Thargoid reinforcements continually dropping out of hyperspace. »

« There have been public demands to know why more superweapons have yet to be deployed. However, Salvation has not responded to this. Some of his supporters believe that it takes time to stockpile the weapons' resources, while others maintain that Salvation is focused on a masterplan to permanently eliminate the Thargoid threat. »

« Until then, individual Commanders and anti-xeno squadrons remain fighting on the front line against the escalating Thargoid incursion. »


* New Phase for Alliance-Sirius Partnership
The Alliance Assembly has invited Sirius Corporation to collaborate on enhancing protection for member systems against the Thargoids.

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported on the development for The Alliance Tribune:

« Sirius Corporation has been a key partner in the Alliance's expansion programme. Most notably, its subsidiary Sirius Atmospherics helped establish colonies in the Coalsack Nebula to support meta-alloy harvesting. »

« But according to insiders, the suspension of Aegis and the increasing Thargoid presence has raised fears that Alliance systems may be vulnerable to xeno invasion. This has led to Prime Minister Edmund Mahon suggesting a strategic defence contract with the megacorp. »

« In response, CEO Li Yong-Rui himself has travelled to the Alioth system. It's understood that high-level discussions are taking place on ways in which the company might augment the Alliance Defence Force's capabilities. »

« Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon's political rival, has repeated her claim that Sirius Corporation has a disturbing amount of influence over some council members. She fears that private agreements are being made behind closed doors, and has called for increased transparency. »


* The Winking Cat's Treasure Hunt
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provides an overview of the Winking Cat's latest escapade.

« The meaning of the message scrawled on the back of the Jokers' Deck ceremonial playing card has become clear. This time, the galaxy's most infamous larcenist is actually giving away treasure rather than stealing it. »

« Three mysterious riddles were somehow inserted into the GalNet feed over the last week. Commanders have reported that clues within these riddles led them to three concealed caches, each in a different system. »

« According to the dates specified by the Winking Cat, these three caches will only be operational for a two-week period, ending on the 30th of December. We can then deduce that caches four, five and six will activate today, and likewise remain available for the next two weeks. »

« This is not the first philanthropic gesture from the Winking Cat. The long-lost painting Penance Street reappeared in 3305 alongside the thief's signature graphic of a cheeky feline face, but this is a more generous giveaway. Some even see it as a redistribution of wealth, noting that the Winking Cat only ever targets corporations, governments or super-rich individuals. »

* GalNet: Apology for Unauthorised Broadcasts
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The GalNet editorial team expresses its sincere regret that further unscheduled messages have been recently published.

A second batch of riddles were unlawfully transmitted across GalNet public feeds on the 24th, 25th and 26th of December. As with the three previous broadcasts, they were designed to invite independent pilots to locate a series of concealed caches.

Our technical teams have identified the method by which the criminal known as the Winking Cat inserted unapproved articles into GalNet's publication network. Security protocols have been heavily reinforced and we are confident that no further intrusions will take place.

GalNet offers formal apologies to all members of the Pilots' Federation for this disruption.


* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part One)
The noted historian Sima Kalhana takes a look back at the turbulent events of the last year in a four-part series of articles.

« The start of 3307 was a time of crisis. The rise of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA), the Marlinist refugee crisis and increased Empire-Federation tensions had brought a full-scale superpower war closer, with renewed attacks from the Thargoids increasing the pressure. »

« All of this led to Pranav Antal's proposal of a diplomatic conference for all three superpower governments to work through their problems \u2013 the very first Galactic Summit. Within weeks, Sirius Corporation was selected as the neutral host for the conference. Li Yong-Rui scored another triumph by establishing the Marlinist Colonies for millions of political refugees who had fled from the Empire. »

« In February came the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, accused of arranging Starship One's destruction back in 3301. His paymaster was revealed as Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester, who wanted to replace Federal democracy with direct corporate rule. »

« His breakaway faction Jupiter Division was defeated in battle and Rochester himself jailed for life. This also led to Core Dynamics's acquisition of Lakon Spaceways being cancelled, leaving the Alliance to purchase a majority sharehold in the company. »

« Key players on the political stage finally gathered when the Galactic Summit began in late February. The Sirius system hosted leaders from the Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent systems. Even pirate warlord Archon Delaine gatecrashed the event, causing controversy with his 'crown of bones' speech. »

« It seemed for a while that the bickering between so many strong personalities might trigger a war rather than avert one. But gradually there was progress, with the possibility of a treaty to increase unity against the Thargoid threat. But before reaching this conclusion, the Galactic Summit was derailed by a threat from another source. »

« Nine Martyrs \u2013 as named by the NMLA leader Theta Seven \u2013 was the largest terrorist attack in history. Hundreds of thousands were killed by starport bombings in nine systems, including the superpower capitals of Alioth, Achenar and Sol. This horrific tragedy ended the conference abruptly, but did give rise to some inter-power cooperation. »

« A new agreement signed at the Galactic Summit allowed the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to be formed rapidly. Drawing on the superpowers' security services and other organisations, its sole purpose was to hunt down and eliminate the NMLA, a task that would dominate the headlines for the rest of the year. »


* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part Two)
Continuing a series of articles by historian Sima Kalhana that look at the most newsworthy events during the past year.

« April 3307 saw the creation of the Federation's Proactive Detection Bureau in reaction to the Nine Martyrs bombings. This organisation monitored all public and private communications for evidence of terrorists, to prevent similar attacks in future. But its highly controversial nature would soon present the Federation with new challenges. »

« ACT's investigation led them to the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, which had helped deliver the caustic enzyme bombs to their nine targets. The faction's defeat was an early victory against the NMLA, but much of the organisation remained a mystery. »

« When the 'ghost ship' Adamastor began receiving an encoded signal, this began an entire saga of mysteries. Its long-lost sister ship, the Hesperus, was soon located by pilots who had been recruited by an anonymous figure named Salvation. His interest in Azimuth Biochemicals, the 200 year old corporation that owned both vessels, would bring a strange twist to the ongoing Thargoid conflict. »

« In May, Hadrian Duval was targeted by Federal forces after accusations that he was the mastermind behind the NMLA. The spectre of Empire-Federation war rose once again as Nova Imperium successfully defended itself, but ACT concluded that evidence had been falsified to implicate Hadrian and his new wife Lady Astrid. »

« Aegis came under intense scrutiny when the megaship Alexandria, laden with newly collected Guardian artefacts, began attracting Thargoids in every system it jumped to. The Alexandria later vanished completely in hyperspace, and to this day remains missing presumed destroyed. »

« The Alliance election finally took place at the end of May, having been delayed by three months due to the Galactic Summit. Councillor Nakato Kaine fought a spirited campaign, but Edmund Mahon was re-elected to serve a second term as prime minister. »

« Supporters of Neo-Marlinism gained a voice in June, when Minister Aaron Whyte offered a peace deal with the Empire to prevent further terrorism. The idea of a political wing of the NMLA gained support from those fearing further bombings, but opened major rifts within the Marlinist Colonies. »

« Salvation once again contacted pilots to track down survivors from the Hesperus. This led to the discovery of an ancient Guardian-Thargoid battleground, where Azimuth scientists had built a research base around their vessel Proteus. All were killed by unusual experiments into weaponising Guardian crystals. »

« The Proactive Detection Bureau had been generally accepted by Federal citizens, but many claimed it was a violation of civil liberties. Halfway through the year, the Azaladshu Free faction took the bold step of seceding from the Federation, thus triggering the possibility of mass rebellion. »


* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part Four)
The last in a series that reviews the events of the past year, by noted historian Sima Kalhana.

« October brought further controversy for the Federation, when a diplomatic conference in the Delta Pavonis system was revealed to be a honey trap designed to capture Yuri Grom. Only a rush of support for EG Union allowed their ruler to escape, causing political embarrassment for President Hudson. »

« There was more corporate drama when Zemina Torval relinquished her long-held majority sharehold of Mastopolos Mining, fuelling rumours of a family rift with her cousins. Torval Mining Ltd became a fully independent corporation run by her daughter Constantia. »

« The Colonia Bridge project officially started the first of two phases this year which would see the construction of 56 megaships between the Alcor and Colonia systems. Brewer Corporation enjoyed great public support for improving this travel corridor along the 22,000 light year journey, and revealed plans to enhance it further in the new year. »

« Hadrian Duval, his wife Lady Astrid and their unborn child were the specific targets of another starport bombing by the NMLA. It proved unsuccessful, but did result in the Imperial Senate offering them protection in order to secure the Duval bloodline. It also led to a manhunt for Theta Seven, the galaxy's most wanted terrorist. »

« In November, Orion University claimed that the dredger occupied by the Scriveners Clan was legally their property, but the nomadic descendants of its original crew refused to give up their home. The stand-off caught the public attention, with some supporting the clan's right to independence and others keen to discover what their Knowledge Core contained. Ultimately the Scriveners retained their freedom, sailing off into the void with their secrets intact. »

« Many were shocked when Admiral Tanner, Aegis's military chief, went rogue and tried to force access to a starport controlled by Salvation's allies. His conviction that the anti-xeno superweapons were responsible for provoking the Thargoids was, however, not enough to win the day. »

« The NMLA threw everything they had at the Mudhrid system in an attempt to rescue Theta Seven, who was hiding among the Far God cult to avoid capture. But the terrorists were crushed by ACT and a coalition of ships, with Theta Seven martyring himself by destroying the hijacked megaship Sacrosanct. »

« A happier event in December was the birth of Hector Duval, son and heir of Hadrian and Lady Astrid. There were celebrations across the Empire, but also questions asked about the future of the Duval dynasty and if the child might one day inherit the Imperial throne. »

« The year ended as it had begun, with Thargoid vessels swarming into nebula systems. But with incursions steadily increasing over recent months, there were fears that this time they might prove unstoppable. Salvation's superweapons were once again deployed to halt the aliens' progress, but will they be enough to prevent the Thargoids from threatening humanity in 3308? »


* Duvals Gather to Celebrate New Year
Princess Aisling Duval marked the start of 3308 by introducing her cousin Hadrian Duval, his wife and their newborn son to Imperial high society.

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios broadcast a report on the event:

« It's an annual tradition for Princess Aisling to invite the great and the good to her palace on Emerald, although the tragic loss of her father in 3306 meant that last year's gathering was cancelled. This year she made up for it with a sumptuous, glittering celebration of the kind that we Imperials are famed for. »

« For the first time, Hadrian Duval and Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval were in attendance. This youthful couple were surprisingly charming for a pair who would once have been arrested on sight. They entertained guests with stories of trading and fighting aboard tiny ships, from the days when their only title was Commander. »

« However, the real guest of honour spent most of his time asleep, oblivious to the colossal attention he drew. Yes, baby Hector made his very first public appearance, having been born while his parents were under senatorial protection. Many dignitaries insisted on having their image recorded beside the 'future Emperor', a phrase one could hear being murmured throughout the palace. »

« But what of the current Emperor? Unlike Hadrian's family, Arissa Lavigny-Duval remains in seclusion and only communicates remotely with the Senate. Now that the terrorists have been quelled, surely the time has come for Her Imperial Majesty to reappear before her loyal subjects? »


* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part Three)
Sima Kalhana reviews the most newsworthy events of the past year in this series of articles.

« July began badly for the Federation, with more factions seceding in response to the Proactive Detection Bureau's establishment. The newly independent nations severed all links with these new surveillance efforts, inspiring many other systems to do likewise. This secession crisis would rumble on for the rest of the year. »

« The Blue Viper Club, one of the rarely seen dredger clans, joined forces with the Kumo Crew to manufacture a medicinal drug that turned out to be a new strain of onionhead. The drug would ultimately end up being legally distributed by Neomedical Industries, causing Archon Delaine to seek revenge against the corporation. »

« Tensions soared in the Marlinist Colonies during an election for the head of their diplomatic consulate. Aaron Whyte's candidate had the support of an Imperial senator, which would have given the Neo-Marlinists a powerful voice within the Empire. »

« When a more moderate candidate was elected, the NMLA reacted by bombing both Marlinist starports, murdering tens of thousands including First Minister Jenna Fairfax. It seemed Theta Seven's extremist views allowed anyone to be targeted as an enemy, even his fellow Marlinists. The civil war concluded in August, with Whyte killed in battle as his supporters were overcome in direct combat. »

« Following accusations of incompetence regarding the vanished Alexandria megaship, Aegis was officially suspended and subjected to a board of inquiry. This would have ramifications for the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids, and encourage Salvation to position himself as an alternative. »

« In the corporate sphere, Zemina Torval created a new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that would eventually become an autonomous company. There were rumours that the Torval and Mastopolos families were now at loggerheads after decades of working in unison. »

« In September, the mystery of Hyford's Cache was finally unlocked. The trail led to revelations of dark experiments which are believed to have involved human test subjects and Thargoid technology. »

« When the Thargoids themselves appeared en masse in the Cornsar system, Salvation was ready for them. An anti-xeno superweapon of undisclosed nature was deployed, wiping out some of the aliens and driving away the rest. It seemed that the self-titled 'man of science' had developed something revolutionary, inspiring many to place their faith in him to end the Thargoid menace once and for all. »


* Alliance and Sirius Agree Defence Pact
Sirius Corporation has signed an agreement to provide the Alliance with ships, materials and personnel to help combat the Thargoids.

The Alliance Assembly and the Council of Admirals held a rare joint vote on the issue of inviting the megacorp to become a strategic defence partner. The motion was debated in private and reportedly passed by a slim majority.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told The Alliance Tribune:

« The danger posed by the Thargoids is increasing once more, perhaps accelerated by the loss of Aegis and a lack of any binding treaty between the superpowers. It is vital that we make a proactive decision to maintain security for Alliance systems. »

« Sirius Corporation will work closely with the Alliance Defence Force to reinforce our member vessels, focusing exclusively on anti-xeno operations. In return, new commercial agreements will provide the company with increased access to certain financial endeavours. »

Councillor Nakato Kaine spoke on behalf of several disapproving members of the Assembly:

« We are already too entwined with this ruthless corporate giant, so to hand our defences over to them is another blow to the Alliance's identity. It is also convenient that the details of the pact remain classified under military restrictions. We don't even know what price we're paying to hire Sirius to be our guard dog. »


* Whistleblower Reveals Imperial Link to NMLA
A potential connection between the NMLA's dark-comms network and Imperial Intelligence has been made public by one of ACT's co-leaders.

Captain Saskia Landau sent a personal statement to all major media outlets:

« The majority of my career has been with the Imperial Internal Security Service, but I was seconded for a year to a classified project run by Imperial Intelligence. To coordinate their operations, they use a sophisticated communications system known as the Omega Grid. This is designed to avoid detection or interception by enemies of the Empire. »

« I have reviewed ACT's research into the NMLA's dark-comms network and can verify its similarity to Omega Grid technology. Since this is exclusively under Imperial Intelligence's control, it suggests that an individual or group within the organisation was making it available to the NMLA. »

« I'm aware that revealing this information publicly may end my career or even endanger my life. Nevertheless, I have shared my findings with ACT's leadership, and call upon the Imperial Senate to open an independent investigation into this evidence. »

As yet there has been no response from Imperial Intelligence or the Senate. However, several agents of the IISS have anonymously spoken to reporters from The Imperial Herald, verifying that the Omega Grid system does exist and has been in use for many years.


* Ram Tah's Revelations Halt Court Martial
The military trial of Admiral Aden Tanner has been suspended following evidence provided by Ram Tah as a witness for the defence.

The Federal Navy tribunal was called to consider multiple charges \u2013 including mutiny \u2013 held against Tanner, the chief military liaison to Aegis. While commanding the Musashi megaship, he attempted to gain access to Hind Mine station and locate evidence regarding Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon.

Admiral Tanner's defence attorney opened a live link with Phoenix Base to allow Ram Tah to provide the following testimony:

« We have analysed the classified experimental equipment that was recently delivered to enable Salvation's superweapons. These components are near-identical to devices found at the Proteus research facility on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2. In 3113, an Azimuth Biochemicals science team conducted weapons testing using Guardian artefacts from this site, accidentally triggering a radiation surge which resulted in their deaths. »

« My hypothesis is that Salvation has constructed large-scale versions of the Proteus design. These generate a powerful electromagnetic pulse at frequencies which disrupt the Thargoids' bio-mechanical technology. »

« It's highly probable that this is based on an existing Guardian weapon discovered by the Proteus. This would explain why its presence within a system attracts Thargoid vessels. »

The Federal Navy Criminal Court announced that Admiral Tanner's court martial has been temporarily suspended while the new evidence is reviewed.


* Colonia Bridge Project Launches Phase Three
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Brewer Corporation intends to improve the travel corridor between the Alcor and Colonia systems by constructing several new starports.

The previous two phases of the Colonia Bridge project established stationary megaships in 56 systems. These provide rest, refuel and repair facilities for vessels making the 22,000 light year journey to and from the Colonia region. The additional infrastructure has also increased the amount of tritium available at these markets, easing the journey for capital-size ships.

A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined this latest initiative:

« Phase three aims to enhance the Colonia Bridge by building permanent starports in key locations along the route. These will offer a wide range of services to travellers, and also serve as homes for the many new communities that we expect to spring up around them. »

« Our plan is to construct one starport in the vicinity of Colonia, and up to five starports stretching out from Alcor. Station structures will be assembled by the 27th of January, with additional services scheduled for implementation at a later date. »

« Pilots are asked to deliver ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system. »

« Assuming deliveries reach the required level, engineered frame shift drives will once again be available as rewards. »

« The highest contributor in Colonia, and up to the top five contributors in Alcor, will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new starports. All name submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. »


* Imperial Intelligence Denies NMLA Connection
Senators have refuted ACT's claim that the NMLA made use of official but highly secret Imperial communications devices.

Captain Saskia Landau maintains that the terrorist group's dark-comms network was very similar to the Omega Grid, an undetectable messaging system used exclusively by Imperial Intelligence.

Senator Karl Nerva told the media:

« In her desperation to seek out the NMLA, Captain Landau is chasing shadows. Imperial Intelligence must operate under total secrecy, but I assure you that this 'Omega Grid' is just as much of an invention to discredit the Empire as Serene Harbour was. »

« Landau has overstepped her authority with these outlandish accusations. I once again propose that ACT be disbanded and its operatives returned to normal duties. »

The Imperial Herald reported that other senators are calling for Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to overrule those who are blocking ACT's investigation. The newsfeed highlighted that she did not attend any functions in person during the past year, and has not broadcast any public messages.

In response, Chancellor Anders Blaine gave this statement:

« Her Majesty was placed under secure protection in early 3307 after several failed assassination attempts by the NMLA. She has been communicating remotely with the Senate on all official business, but does plan to return to Capitol very soon. »


* Sirius Navy Unites with Alliance Defence Force
A new member has been appointed to the Council of Admirals to represent Sirius Corporation as the Alliance's strategic defence partner.

Political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

« There are always six seats on the Council of Admirals, taken by senior military commanders from the largest regional fleets. Not only is this the first time that a seventh position has been created, it's also the first to come from outside the Alliance. »

« The new addition is Admiral Nikolas Glass, a highly decorated officer with the Sirius Navy. His new role is to coordinate the Alliance's anti-Thargoid operations, which from now on will be directly supported by Sirius Corporation. »

« Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin both endorsed this development as a way of strengthening the Alliance Defence Force, which lacks the might of the Federal or Imperial Navy. Many member systems have demanded increased protection against the Thargoid threat, so this news is likely to be well received. »

« As expected, Councillor Nakato Kaine opposed the defence pact, with Admiral George Varma also critical of 'merging commercial interests with military matters'. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran also admitted that she abstained during the recent joint vote, but chose not to elaborate on her reasons. So it seems that the Assembly is not fully confident about this union with Sirius Corporation. »


* Torval Mining Challenges Caine-Massey
The company owned by Senator Zemina Torval is attempting to acquire a mining contract previously awarded to the Caine-Massey corporation.

The agreement affects multiple corporations on the fringes of Federal space around the Dulos system, who for the last decade have purchased mined ore and other raw materials directly from Caine-Massey. With the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd has made an official bid.

An announcement was made by Constantia Torval, the company's operations director and daughter of Zemina Torval:

« We have enjoyed enormous success in a short space of time by providing services to the Empire. This is an opportunity to reach a broader customer base, and convince them that they too can benefit from Torval Mining's expertise. »

Johann Fleischer, the vice president of Caine-Massey, remarked:

« Our corporation is proud of its origins within the Federation, and we have supplied these systems with resources for many years. This is a surreptitious attempt by an Imperial senator to boost her own standing by hijacking Federal business. »

The Federal Commerce Authority has responded to Caine-Massey's request for intervention. An initial review found that, while it recognises the aggression of the Torval Mining claims, there is no exclusivity clause in place that prevents the companies in question from holding talks with an Imperial supplier now Caine-Massey's contract term is expiring.


* Baumann Report: 'Dismantle Aegis'
The independent inquiry into Aegis has delivered its final conclusions and recommended that the organisation be closed down.

Dr Paul Baumann, who chaired the board of inquiry, summarised the detailed report:

« Aegis was established on solid foundations in 3303 with strong leadership. Over the years, poor mid-level management and general negligence reduced its effectiveness. A silo mentality developed, with each department focusing on itself rather than strategic goals. »

« Reduced funding undoubtedly contributed to low morale among staff and a lack of any further breakthroughs in AX technology. But a reliance on independent pilots to combat the Thargoids became normalised, with some staff considering them 'disposable mercenaries'. »

« More specifically, the loss of the megaship Alexandria and the illegal attack against Hind Mine are both catastrophes that could have been anticipated and prevented. This board cannot in all conscience recommend any scenario that might enable further loss of life in Aegis's name. »

Observers have noted that the Baumann Report, as it is commonly referred to, does not discuss Salvation or suggest methods of replacing Aegis.

In related news, the court martial of Admiral Aden Tanner has concluded with a verdict of guilty and a dishonourable discharge from the Federal Navy. However, his sentencing has been postponed by request from newly promoted Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who has ordered a full review of evidence provided by Ram Tah.


* Corporations Compete for Mining Contract
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd are running rival campaigns to deliver mined commodities to the Dulos system.

For the past decade, the megacorp Caine-Massey has supplied ore and other raw materials to several subsidiaries in the region. But with the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd is making a bid for the lucrative business.

Constantia Torval, operations director for the Empire-based company, outlined the initiative:

« We are calling upon pilots to provide the following mined materials: bromellite, samarium and gallite. These should be delivered to the Pride of Bitterwood in the Dulos system. Your assistance will directly support our proposal to win this contract and expand our entire enterprise. »

Caine-Massey published a similar request from its vice president, Johann Fleischer:

« The citizens within this region deserve a high standard of service, and we aim to continue meeting their needs. The Green Party of Dulos, acting on our behalf, shall offer generous rewards for shipments of mined bromellite, samarium and gallite delivered to Smith Port in the Dulos system. »

The corporate distributors within the region have agreed that whichever candidate is able to provide the greatest amount of materials will be awarded the contract for the next decade.


* Materials Delivered for Colonia Bridge Starports
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The third phase of Brewer Corporation's Colonia Bridge project has proven successful, according to a recent announcement.

Shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were transported in large numbers to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system. As a result, several new starports will be constructed along the travel corridor to Colonia.

Brewer Corporation released this statement regarding the initiative:

« Once again, we owe a great deal to the pilots who brought us so many vital resources. We can now proceed with constructing one starport in the vicinity of Colonia and 5 starports in systems branching out from Alcor. These will increase the value of the Colonia Bridge for travellers, tourists and commercial interests alike. »

« The starport infrastructures are scheduled to be built by the 27th of January. Initially they will provide rearm, refuel and repair services, but will lack markets and other facilities. The distances involved in ferrying equipment to these locations means that these starports will become fully operational in stages over a period of weeks. »

« Contributors will be able to collect their rewards from Jaques Station and Macdonald Settlement from the 14th of January. The proposed engineered frame shift drives for those eligible will follow at a later date. The dedicated pilots who provided the most deliveries in Alcor and Colonia will receive invitations to submit suggestions to name the new starports, subject to review. »


* Sirius Gov Enters the Alioth System
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has invited Sirius Corporation to establish a permanent presence within the Alliance.

The Alliance Tribune's political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported:

« Sirius Corporation's new role as a strategic defence partner has expanded swiftly, with a Sirius faction established in the Alioth system to represent the megacorp. In addition, several megaships have arrived in other Allied systems to provide support. »

« The Alliance Defence Force and some government departments now have official advisors from Sirius Corporation on their staff. Prime Minister Mahon announced that these developments will streamline joint operations with the Sirius Navy, and in turn provide effective countermeasures against Thargoid aggression. »

« But Councillor Nakato Kaine claims that the presence of Sirius Gov is illegal as it was not ratified by the Assembly. She has pointed out that since the defence pact makes this a classified military matter, any civil action to reverse Mahon's executive decision has been deliberately blocked. »


* Senate Blocks ACT Investigation
There are claims that the Imperial Senate is preventing efforts to examine a potential link between the Empire's security services and the NMLA.

Captain Saskia Landau has publicly stated that the terrorists' dark-comms network is closely related to the Omega Grid system used exclusively by Imperial Intelligence. She expanded on her theory in a statement to Vox Galactica:

« Based on evidence and interrogation transcripts obtained by ACT, I believe that rogue elements within Imperial Intelligence were training and providing equipment to the NMLA. This would help explain the level of sophistication they achieved in coordinating their starport attacks and communicating without detection. »

« There is certainly enough circumstantial proof to warrant a dedicated investigation. But the Senate is refusing to authorise this, which makes me wonder what they are trying to hide. »

Senator Karl Nerva reiterated: « It is time for ACT to devolve and return much-needed resources to the Empire where they belong. »

However, Senator Caspian Leopold responded: « To alleviate any lack of confidence in our security services, we should examine Captain Landau's allegation rigorously. Our citizens must be reassured that Imperial Intelligence exists solely for their protection. »


* Superpowers Plan to Replace Aegis
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have accepted the Baumann Report's recommendation to permanently shut down Aegis.

The independent inquiry's findings on the organisation's failings will result in Aegis being immediately shut down. However, Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong has cautioned that « full demobilisation of staff, ships and resources might take several months ».

Senator Denton Patreus has successfully obtained senatorial approval for an increased military budget, to allow the Imperial Navy to directly take on the role played by Aegis.

Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori likewise confirmed that the Federal Congress has ordered the creation of a new naval strike force. On his own authority he has also commissioned an investigation into Salvation, following Ram Tah's testimony regarding the nature of the anti-xeno superweapon.

Admiral Nikolas Glass, who was recently appointed to the Council of Admirals, stated that the Alliance Defence Force and Sirius Navy will work in conjunction to fulfil Aegis's purpose.

Xenological research laboratories set up by Professor Alba Tesreau will now transfer their work to specialist departments in the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village University. In 3304 the Thargoids made targeted strikes against Aegis's labs, but all three institutions have made assurances that the new locations will have the highest security.


* The Missing Emperor?
Princess Aisling Duval has discussed growing concerns over Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's lack of public engagements in recent months.

In an interview with The Imperial Herald, she said:

« Chancellor Blaine assures us that the Emperor has been kept in seclusion for nearly a year to protect her from the NMLA. But why has this prevented the Empire's ruler from engaging with her citizens? After all, Hadrian Duval and his family were placed under the same senatorial protection without disappearing altogether. »

« We know that the Emperor has communicated with the Senate on various matters during this time. Government channels are generally trusted thanks to Imperial Intelligence's verification protocols. But Captain Landau's recent testimony, which links Imperial Intelligence to the NMLA, has me concerned. How can I be sure that a breach to our most secure networks wasn't responsible for the location and murder of my father, Prince Harold? »

« Until Arissa appears in person, it is irresponsible to assume her safety is guaranteed. I will be most relieved to have my fears proved wrong. »

Chancellor Anders Blaine responded:

« With the greatest respect to Princess Duval, I have never had cause to believe that Her Majesty the Emperor is in any danger from her own security agencies. Her imminent return to public life should alleviate such concerns. »


* Caine-Massey Wins Mining Contract
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Caine-Massey corporation has beaten Torval Mining Ltd to retain a mining contract in the Dulos system.

Competing campaigns were waged by the two rivals for the rights to supply ore and mined materials to many local subsidiaries.

Johann Fleischer, vice president of Caine-Massey, declared their victory:

« We wish to thank the large number of pilots who delivered bromellite, samarium and gallite. Thanks to your hard work, our contract has been renewed for another decade. I like to think that we have also secured the honour of the Federation by stalling the Empire's plans. »

Rewards for contributors to Caine-Massey are now available for collection at Smith Port in the Dulos system.

Torval Mining Ltd also received many deliveries of materials but in insufficient quantities to secure the contract. Constantia Torval has confirmed that the pilots who supported their initiative can collect payment at the Pride of Bitterwood megaship.


* Federal Government Plans for the Future
President Zachary Hudson has delivered a speech to Congress on maintaining security for the Federation in the coming years.

Excerpts from his address include the following:

« In the last year, we have excelled at protecting Federal citizens from harm. The Proactive Detection Bureau proved its worth in locating terrorists before they could strike, and our security services played an instrumental role in the NMLA's defeat. »

« 3308 is already bringing many challenges. The war against the Thargoids could escalate at any time, and we face the challenge of replacing Aegis with our own anti-xeno taskforce. We are also deeply concerned about increased infighting within the Alliance and Empire, which could easily spill over into our territory. »

« My administration is holding high-level discussions about how best to keep the Federation strong and secure. We will soon make some brave proposals to continue meeting our people's constitutional right to safety. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters delivered this rebuttal:

« President Hudson fails to mention his disastrous attempt to capture Yuri Grom, his former fleet admiral's criminal conviction for destroying Starship One, or that his surveillance laws forced several systems to declare independence. I would argue that under his leadership, the Federation has never been weaker or less secure. »


* The Return of the Alexandria
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Aegis megaship Alexandria, which vanished in hyperspace seven months ago, has been found in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0 system.

A select group of independent pilots located the Alexandria following a search instigated by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis. She was forced to resign as a result of the Baumann Report, which was instigated by the controversial loss of this megaship.

In June 3307, the Alexandria was pursued by Thargoid vessels due to a considerable number of Guardian artefacts held on board. It initiated a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system to offload its cargo but never arrived. The megaship was assumed to have been hyperdicted by the Thargoids, resulting in the death of all four thousand crewmembers.

According to on-site witnesses, the remains of the Alexandria are currently scattered across the planetary rings of Wregoe TC-X b29-0 AB 2 A. Ships are investigating the debris, but so far have not reported finding any survivors or Guardian relics.

Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong made a public statement:

« Losing the Alexandria was as tragic as it was mysterious, but we now have an opportunity to learn what happened. Aegis should remain operational until a full analysis has been completed and we can understand the cause of the megaship's destruction. »


* Reorte Resists Sirius Corporation
The presence of Sirius Corporation in the Reorte system at the Alliance's invitation has been challenged by the controlling faction.

In its new role as a strategic defence partner, Sirius Corporation recently established itself in several Alliance systems. But its megaship in Reorte, Chariot of Rhea, has found itself blockaded by system security and refused permission to offload cargo or personnel.

A broadcast was made by Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition:

« Councillor Kaine is right to say that Sirius is acting illegally. The prime minister did not consult us or any other Allied faction on working with them, and there's good reason to be sceptical of their motives. We regard the Chariot of Rhea as an intruder and insist that it leaves immediately. »

Li Yong-Rui has assured Alliance leaders that Sirius Corporation will only be collaborating on anti-Thargoid defence projects. He stressed that there will be no disruption to any local civil or commercial activity.

The Alliance Tribune commented on the situation:

« Many Allied systems welcomed the news that our military is being bolstered by Sirius Corporation. But others expressed disapproval, particularly among the Old Worlds where the populations tend to be more sceptical of change. What happens in Reorte could determine whether or not the new defence pact becomes widely accepted. »


* Arissa Addresses the Empire
The Imperial Senate has shared a personal message from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, who has been in a secure location for nearly a year.

The brief statement was broadcast on all public channels:

« Citizens of the Empire, be assured that your Emperor is alive and well. I regret that my temporary seclusion has lasted for so long, but I have remained in contact with the Senate during this time. »

« I was advised to depart from Capitol when Imperial Intelligence warned me about a legitimate NMLA assassination attempt, and of Marlinist sympathisers within the highest levels of our government. Once the work of this loyal agency is complete, I will continue my work in leading us toward a prosperous future. »

Eye on Achenar reported that this address was « welcomed by a relieved Empire », adding that it was vital to « root out all Marlinist traitors ». The Imperial Herald noted that the Emperor seemed to absolve Imperial Intelligence of the allegations that it was secretly enabling the NMLA.

However, a caution was sounded by Princess Aisling Duval:

« Arissa has communicated with the Senate in the same manner for months, so this changes nothing. Only a public appearance will alleviate my concerns regarding her wellbeing. I would be delighted to host a suitable event if she will accept my invitation to attend in person. »


* Conflict Erupts in the Reorte System
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Reorte Mining Coalition has declared its intent to remove the Sirius Corporation presence from its home system.

The megaship Chariot of Rhea arrived in Reorte as part of Sirius Corporation's new role as the Alliance's strategic defence partner. But the system's controlling faction ordered it to withdraw. The megaship's non-compliance has resulted in skirmishes targeting Sirius forces.

Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition, announced:

« We fully support Councillor Kaine's position that Sirius Corporation is operating illegally under Alliance law. Therefore, we will defend our territory from this aggressive foreign entity. »

A response was broadcast by Captain Delfina Dominguez of the Sirius Navy, who commands the Chariot of Rhea:

« Our presence is authorised by the military contract between Sirius Corporation and the Alliance Defence Force. If local forces continue to attack, we will have no option but to defend our assets. »

The fighting is not believed to have reached surface level and is expected to remain a ship-based conflict.

To rally support from independent pilots, both factions are offering access to permit-locked systems. Reorte Mining Coalition will sponsor distribution of an Alioth system permit, while Sirius Corporation will authorise a permit to the Sirius system.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has ordered the Reorte Mining Coalition to cease hostilities immediately. However, Councillor Ainsley Niven  \u2013 who represents Reorte in the Assembly and is a political supporter of Nakato Kaine \u2013 claims that the faction has the right to protect its territory, since it was not invited to ratify the defence pact.


* New Starports Created for Colonia Bridge
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The infrastructures of six starports have been completed along the travel corridor between Colonia and the core systems.

Brewer Corporation has confirmed that five starport frames were constructed in systems branching out from Alcor, with a sixth closer to the Colonia system. The new stations are:

Zerreiss Station in the Pru Euq WO-D b53-8 system

Helgrind Gateway in the NGC 6530 Sector ZE-X b2-0 system

Vladmir McDoogle's Triumph in the Flyiedge VN-W c4-51 system

Canonn Complex in the Prua Phoe MI-B b17-5 system

Venatores Hub in the Blua Eaec WW-E c14-1293 system

Promium Relay in the Eoch Flyuae QK-E d12-2118 system

At present the starports are not fully operational and only provide rearm, refuel and repair services. Basic commodity trading has also been established to accommodate pilots selling construction materials and to supply tritium fuel.

A fourth phase of the Colonia Bridge project is scheduled to begin on the 10th of February, which will aim to complete construction and add a broader range of facilities.

Brewer Corporation was able to meet all of its targets for phase three due to the considerable amount of raw materials delivered by the galactic community. The names of the new starports were selected by those pilots who made the greatest contributions to the initiative.


* 'Azimuth has Survived' Warns Aegis
Information recovered from the Alexandria has prompted Aegis to insist that it was not responsible for the loss of the megaship's crew and cargo.

The wreckage of the Alexandria was recently located in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0 system. There were no survivors, but fragments of the commanding officer's log were found.

Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong published this statement on behalf of Aegis:

« The logs made by Captain Jacob Morales tell a bleak tale. The Alexandria was deliberately sabotaged to leave it stranded and powerless. They were met by an unidentified group posing as a rescue team, who slaughtered most of the crew and hijacked the Guardian artefacts. The survivors later made a desperate attempt to initiate the hyperdrive, which sadly led to their destruction. »

« We can now prove that the Alexandria's loss was not caused by negligence, as claimed by the Baumann Report. In reality, the megaship was snared in a trap laid by an organised quasi-military force. »

« Furthermore, Captain Morales discovered that the raiders worked for someone they referred to as 'the Witch'. That name was mentioned in logs discovered at HIP 22460 regarding Project Seraph \u2013 vile experiments perpetrated by Azimuth researchers to install human test pilots into Thargoid vessels. »

« This evidence suggests that Azimuth Biochemicals has survived in some form over the last two hundred years, and remains focused on aggressive xenological research. Aegis must be reinstated immediately to counter this dangerous organisation before more lives are lost. »


* ACT Defies Imperial Decree
The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit is actively investigating Imperial Intelligence, despite the Senate ordering it to cease operations.

Inspector Mara Klatt, one of ACT's co-leaders, told the media:

« We are convinced that elements within Imperial Intelligence provided support to the NMLA. Our view is that a modified version of the Omega Grid software was supplied to the terrorists, allowing them to build their own dark-comms network. Thanks to Captain Saskia Landau's inside knowledge, we are learning how to detect a unique identifier associated with the network employed by the NMLA. »

« Our actions may have political repercussions, but this taskforce is dedicated to finding and destroying the NMLA. We must follow the trail wherever it leads. »

Civil and military leaders in the Empire have reacted with outrage, including Senator Zemina Torval:

« Are we expected to risk our citizens' lives by letting our security services be compromised? How might the Alliance or Federation respond if we attempted to hack into Interpol or the FIA? »

However, a plea for cooperation was made by Princess Aisling Duval:

« If nefarious groups within our Empire have helped the NMLA, we must uncover the truth. I firmly believe that the Emperor herself remains in danger, and ACT might help us to learn her fate. »


* Help Needed to Crack the NMLA's Network
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has launched an effort to locate and decipher the NMLA's dark-comms network.

The request was sent by Captain Saskia Landau, one of ACT's co-leaders:

« ACT is working to gain access to the Omega Grid version that was provided to the NMLA by its mysterious benefactors. Most of our agents seconded from the IISS have been recalled, and some Senate leaders are blocking our progress. Therefore, we urgently need support from independent pilots, which will contribute to our wider efforts to decrypt the network. »

« To begin with, we have triangulated the possible location of an Omega Grid beacon somewhere within the HIP 290 system. If it can be found, this will validate our strategy and quickly lead to further discoveries. »

« Messages relayed across this network are likely to be encrypted. Our analysts have put together a partial cipher key from other data. Any files recovered from the beacon may help with deducing the rest of the cipher. »

« If the beacon in the HIP 290 system is found, any pilot who scans it can expect further instruction on subsequent days. »

The partial cipher key is as follows:

A = H

B = G

C = J

E = L

F = K

L = Q

M = T

O = V

P = U

Q = X

S = Z

T = Y

U = B

V = A

W = D


* Sirius Corporation Ejected from Reorte
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Reorte Mining Coalition has succeeded in forcing Sirius Corporation to withdraw from the Reorte system.

Despite the megacorp's strategic defence pact with the Alliance, Reorte's controlling faction claimed the Sirius megaship Chariot of Rhea was an illegal intruder. This resulted in open conflict, which has ended with Sirius Corporation's defeat.

Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition, transmitted this message:

« With the support of many brave pilots, we have prevented Sirius from sinking its claws into the Reorte system. I hope our victory will convince the Alliance's leaders to think twice about their deal with the devil. »

Captain Delfina Dominguez has confirmed that Sirius Corporation has started to withdraw from Reorte. The megaship Chariot of Rhea will leave Reorte and jump to the Leesti system pending further discussions with Allied leaders.

Sources have confirmed that permits to the Alioth and Sirius systems have been allocated to independent pilots depending on the faction they supported during the conflict.

The Assembly has held emergency meetings to debate this turn of events. Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents the Reorte system, delivered a warning to Prime Minister Mahon:

« You have invited Sirius Corporation to provide military aid against the Thargoids, but without seeking the approval of those we are pledged to protect. That is not the way of the Alliance, no matter how grave the threat. »


* Hudson Attempts to Remove Presidential Limit
The Federal government has announced plans to extend Zachary Hudson's term as president beyond the legally allotted span.

Every Federation president serves a single term of eight years. President Hudson assumed the role in June 3301, and is therefore due to step down in June 3309 following an election to select his replacement.

Secretary of State Lana Berkovich delivered the proposal to Congress:

« We live in extraordinary times, and all signs point to further challenges in the coming years. Our people deserve a steady hand at the helm rather than being forced to change political course, especially with the tempestuous developments found within our neighbouring superpowers. »

« It is therefore in the public interest that we temporarily suspend the arbitrary eight-year limitation, to allow President Hudson to continue steering the Federation through the coming storms. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters condemned the proposal:

« Hudson has already violated the Federal Accord with his surveillance laws, but now we can see how little he values our constitution. This is the act of a dictator, not a democratically elected president. »

A few Republican congressmen reluctantly agreed with Winters, joining calls for President Hudson to withdraw the proposal. However, political analysts believe that Hudson enjoys the support of his entire Cabinet and a majority of the Republican Party.


* The Fall of Aegis
Shutdown procedures for the anti-xeno organisation are continuing, despite Aegis's warnings that Azimuth has returned.

Conrad Sterling reported on the situation for Vox Galactica:

« We now know that the Alexandria megaship was targeted by a hostile force that could be Azimuth Biochemicals, the 200-year-old corporation which owned the Adamastor and Hesperus. In the face of this new evidence, Aegis leaders have petitioned for it to be reinstated. »

« Even while accounting for this new evidence, the Baumann Report has exposed a litany of organisational failures within Aegis. There is still a broad consensus among politicians that the organisation should have done more to repel the Thargoids. »

« Many senior military figures have switched focus to Aegis's controversial rival Salvation, despite his mysterious nature. As one Imperial Navy admiral succinctly put it: 'Salvation's methods have proved more effective in counteracting the Thargoid threat.' »

« The issue of military staff defections also appears to have been resolved. Alliance, Federal and Imperial fleets have opened channels of secondment, allowing naval crews to voluntarily take positions aboard Salvation's vessels without resigning their commissions. »

« However, one of Aegis's requests has been authorised. There will be a public ceremony to posthumously award medals of honour to Captain Jacob Morales and the four thousand people who lost their lives aboard the Alexandria. »


* Concerns Raised over Alliance-Sirius Pact
The recent battle in the Reorte system has caused Sirius Corporation to question the terms of its partnership with the Alliance.

The Alliance Tribune's political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported:

« When Sirius Corporation megaships arrived in four Allied systems, it's fair to assume they anticipated a degree of public resistance. But being directly attacked by the Reorte Mining Coalition clearly wasn't part of their risk assessment. »

« Li Yong-Rui has urgently sought assurances from the Alliance that such conflicts will not happen again. The megacorp's CEO claimed that he has a duty to protect his employees from aggression by their own clients. »

« In response, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon personally guaranteed that this unfortunate incident was a one-off, stressing that Sirius personnel have been welcomed in the Alioth, Arimpox and Di Jian systems. He added that the Alliance Defence Force is working closely with Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy's representative. »

« But others in the Assembly are now openly questioning the wisdom of the strategic defence pact. Although Councillor Nakato Kaine's opposition to Mahon is often viewed as predictable, more members now agree with her that many Allied factions will reject the assertion that Sirius Corporation is an ally to be trusted. »


* Arissa Rescued from Year-Long Captivity
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has been found alive after being secretly imprisoned by the private military firm Darkwater Inc.

The Imperial Herald published a special report on recent events:

« The absence of the Emperor from public life for over a year has prompted much speculation. The Senate claimed that she was being kept safe from assassination attempts by the NMLA, and that they remained in contact with her. »

« In truth, she was being held captive by the NMLA's secret benefactors. This group of Imperial senators referred to themselves as the Lords of Restoration. They were revealed only after ACT recruited independent pilots to help decipher the terrorists' dark-comms network. »

« Chancellor Blaine immediately ordered the Imperial Guard into battle against Darkwater soldiers. A ship fleeing from the Summerland system was intercepted, aboard which was a cryogenic pod containing the Emperor herself. She was swiftly returned to Capitol, and is currently under the care of the Imperial Palace medical team. »

« The IISS has launched a security operation based on ACT's information. This reveals that groups within the Senate, Darkwater and Imperial Intelligence formed a long-running conspiracy to fund and empower the NMLA. Senators Alberto Gereon, Karl Nerva, Ursula Torquatus and several others have been placed under arrest. »

« ACT has stated that it will provide additional information soon. »


* Colonia Bridge Project Enters Final Phase
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries have been requested in the Alcor and Colonia systems to implement services to the Colonia Bridge starports.

A press release from Brewer Corporation provided the details:

« The fourth and final phase of our Colonia Bridge project will take place over the next four weeks. Our goal is to finish constructing the starports that were recently added to the route between the Colonia and Alcor systems. »

« For the first week, we require deliveries of Coffee, Emergency Power Cells, Geological Equipment and Liquid Oxygen to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. If we receive sufficient commodities, we can add Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics to all six stations. »

« Everyone at Brewer Corporation was impressed by the galactic community's dedication to improving the travel corridor to the Colonia region. For this week's initiative, contributing pilots have the opportunity to be rewarded with a generous number of credits. In subsequent weeks, we will be offering a variety of additional rewards. »

« Following feedback from our shareholders, we also plan to install beacons to recognise the major contributors to all phases of the Colonia Bridge project. The top ten contributors of every past and upcoming Colonia Bridge initiative will be listed on these beacons to immortalise the names of these pilots. »

The Colonia Bridge starports currently offer rearm, refuel and repair services as well as basic commodity trading. The second, third and fourth weeks of this phase will focus on adding further services.


* New Thargoid Assaults in Three Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The HIP 12314, Dan and Nauni systems have come under heavy attack by Thargoid vessels.

Vox Galactica featured this report by freelance war correspondent Jade Sanderlyn:

« The Thargoids have been unusually aggressive in recent months, as attested by the drifting wreckages of many independent ships. When Salvation repelled their forces from the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems in December, some believed it was only a matter of time before the aliens retaliated. It appears that time has come. »

« Although the Thargoid species is often viewed as territorial, on this occasion they have pushed further towards human space. Authorities in all three systems were unprepared for the incursions and have sent out a general call for assistance. »

« The superpowers are still in the process of forming their anti-xeno taskforces, and thus unable to help. Fortunately, despite Aegis being officially defunct, some of its support megaships have yet to be decommissioned. These have been staffed with emergency crews and rushed into service in all three systems. »

« As pilots race into combat once more, many must be wondering if the risks are now even greater. Have the Thargoids extended their reach into human space? Which systems might they strike at next? And is further escalation a price to be paid every time Salvation's superweapon is deployed? »


* ACT Exposes the Lords of Restoration
The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has unveiled a secret cabal of Imperial senators who masterminded the NMLA's terrorist activity.

The information was obtained after ACT successfully penetrated the NMLA's dark-comms network. Captain Saskia Landau provided this summary to the media:

« Senators Gereon, Jourdain, Nerva, Scordato and Torquatus were at the heart of a powerful conspiracy to permanently remove the position of Emperor. They called themselves the Lords of Restoration, based on their aim to restore executive power to the Senate. »

« The NMLA became their terroristic agents, weaponised to assassinate the Duvals and other obstacles. Its members were militarised at Darkwater training camps and provided with sophisticated equipment by corrupt Imperial Intelligence agents. But the Lords could never fully control the terrorist figurehead Theta Seven, whose attacks against non-Imperial starports were not part of their original plan. »

« Marlinism was also exploited as a political lever. The hope was that, compared to this democratic ideology, citizens would view a senator-led Empire as a moderate compromise once the Imperial Family was gone. While this led to the establishment of the Marlinist Colonies, the Lords' later attempts to influence those systems via puppet politicians did not succeed. »

« Following the assassinations of Prince Harold and other Duvals, the Lords abducted Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval in January 3307. She was kidnapped en route to a secure location, with Senator Nerva falsifying confirmation of her safe arrival. This allowed the Lords to engineer communications with the Senate via a virtual doppelganger, which were accepted as genuine since they were verified by Imperial Intelligence agents. »

ACT is working closely with Imperial security agencies to identify all those who collaborated with the Lords of Restoration.


* Federation Divided by Hudson's Proposal
President Zachary Hudson's intention to remove the limit on his term in office has caused a deep rift among congressmen and voters alike.

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino analysed the situation in The Federal Times:

« Ever since the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord was ratified in 2594, no president has remained in office for longer than eight years. This is why the Hudson Contravention, as Congress officially refers to it, has turned up the heat on the simmering political division within the Federation. »

« Members of the Cabinet and other leading Republicans have argued passionately that only Zachary Hudson has the experience and fortitude to guide the Federation through this eventful period in history. His supporters point to successes such as curtailing the secession crisis, ending the NMLA threat and introducing greater security via the Proactive Detection Bureau. »

« However, others insist that repealing this amendment could pave the way from democracy to dictatorship. Two former presidents \u2013 Antonia Madison and Jasmina Halsey \u2013 have publicly condemned the Hudson Contravention as unconstitutional and dangerous. »

« There are expectations that Shadow President Felicia Winters will move for a vote of no confidence. Political analysts suspect that after several controversial leadership decisions from Hudson last year, he would be unlikely to win over a majority in Congress. »


* Arissa Retakes the Imperial Throne
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has attended a public ceremony following her year-long abduction by the Lords of Restoration.

Her proclamation from Trasken Square, standing before millions of Capitol's citizens and flanked by legions of Imperial Guard, was broadcast across all channels:

« To those who protected the Empire during my enforced absence, I offer my deepest gratitude. My trusted chancellor, senators and security agencies are to be commended. »

« To those who dared to attack Imperial citizens, who dared to impersonate me and mislead my people\u2026who took the lives of my family. Know this: there will be no place to hide from my wrath. »

« And to all citizens who may fear these uncertain times, I vow that your Emperor will lead you into the glorious future that is ours by right. »

Subsequent messages from the Imperial Palace praised ACT and its supporters for their work in freeing Arissa and destroying the NMLA. Princess Aisling Duval was also thanked for her dedication to finding out the truth, although some newsfeeds have noted that Aisling would hold a strong claim on a vacated throne.


* Empire Declares Reprisals Against Darkwater
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Darkwater Inc in the Summerland system has been declared a hostile military target for its role in abducting Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.

The private military firm, led by Colonel Ronan Brock, was secretly hired by the Lords of Restoration to train and equip the NMLA. Darkwater troops also kept the Emperor imprisoned in a concealed bunker for over a year.

Once their involvement was revealed by ACT, Darkwater's forces regrouped around the megaship Pearl Mandate. Colonel Brock led an attempt to gain control of Summerland as a defensive measure but was unsuccessful. The mercenaries have now been branded as wanted criminals by the system authorities.

The order to strike against Darkwater came directly from Emperor Arissa:

« I call upon my loyal servants and all other warriors of honour to wipe out this nest of traitors. We remember the innocent victims of the NMLA by punishing those who enabled them. »

The Summerland Patron's Party will redeem combat bonds for destroyed Darkwater ships at the starport Henry O'Hare's Hangar. Although the Summerland system is typically permit locked, the Empire has arranged a total exemption for independent pilots for a three-week period.

To guarantee that Darkwater is thoroughly eliminated, the Empire is offering a range of incentives to pilots. These include awarding the rank of Master in the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, discounts on Imperial ships and weapons in the Summerland system, and Imperial Hammer railguns for the ten pilots who achieve the most combat bonds.


* Additional Services Planned for Colonia Bridge
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Brewer Corporation has requested a new batch of deliveries to the Alcor and Colonia systems.

The Colonia Bridge is comprised of 56 stationary megaships and six starports, providing facilities to travellers between the core systems and the Colonia region. However, the starports are still in a state of construction.

The megacorp outlined its latest requirements in a press release:

« Phase four of the Colonia Bridge project launched with a highly satisfactory first week. Shipments of coffee, emergency power cells, geological equipment and liquid oxygen arrived in sufficient numbers to ensure Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics services were added to all six starports. »

« The goal of the second week is to continue assembling the stations' infrastructure, and install Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge and Search and Rescue services. To achieve this, performance enhancers, personal weapons and survival equipment are needed in large quantities. »

« Pilots are asked to provide these at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. As well as guaranteeing generous reimbursements to all contributors, Brewer Corporation is pleased to offer warm, white cockpit lights as an additional token of gratitude. »

The third and fourth weeks of the project's final phase will focus on adding further services on the Colonia Bridge starports to accommodate all pilot professions.


* Pilots Form Vanguard Against Thargoid Attacks
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Commanders are resisting Thargoid incursions in the Dan, HIP 12314 and Nauni systems.

Although Aegis support vessels have been repurposed to offer support in all three systems, the organisation remains officially disbanded. It has fallen to individual pilots to defend the populations from swarms of Thargoid vessels.

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy all intend to replace Aegis with their own anti-xeno taskforces, but these have yet to materialise. This was remarked upon by independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse:

« We've got the Alliance trying to sell its own people to Sirius Corporation, the Empire somehow misplacing its own Emperor, and the Federation being torn to pieces by its crazy president\u2026 who's got time to worry about Thargoids? I'll tell you who: the civilians in the systems they're invading! Our so-called leaders are praying that Salvation will step in and save the day, but he could be an alien himself for all we know! »

Commodore Morag Halloran, who serves as Salvation's military coordinator, was approached by Vox Galactica to comment on his strategy for combating the latest Thargoid activity:

« Salvation is currently focused on further development of the anti-xeno superweapon. At present this is the most efficient use of his time and resources, rather than small-scale engagement. Rest assured that, before long, we shall take the fight to the Thargoids once more. »


* Further Omega Grid Secrets Revealed
ACT has released details about a plan by the Lords of Restoration to frame Hadrian Augustus Duval as the leader of the NMLA.

The information was extracted from the NMLA's Omega Grid network and published by Captain Saskia Landau:

« It was Senator Ursula Torquatus who devised a scheme to undermine the Imperial Family and turn citizens against them by 'exposing' a Duval as the NMLA mastermind. Hadrian Duval was seen as the logical choice since many viewed him as an extremist through his prior association with Nova Imperium, though Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval officially pardoned him in 3306. »

« The Lords of Restoration used a virtual doppelganger of the Emperor, indistinguishable from authentic transmissions, to convince the Senate that she was communicating from a safe location. A similar doppelganger was developed to replicate Hadrian and was used to send orders to NMLA allies such as the Landgrave of Mudhrid. »

« This is how they planted evidence, discovered in April 3307, that Hadrian had converted to Neo-Marlinism and was determined to wipe out all other Duvals. Yet, despite triggering an unsuccessful Federal attack in the Paresa system, the accusation was not verified or widely believed. »

« Months later, the Lords of Restoration tried to kill Hadrian and Lady Astrid before their son Hector could be born, fearing the continuation of the Duval dynasty. But other senators moved the family to a secure location, beyond the reach of their agents. »

Hadrian Duval has publicly thanked ACT for uncovering this information and officially absolving him of all suspicion in this matter.


* Hudson Contravention Sparks Federal Protests
President Zachary Hudson's proposal to remove the eight-year limit on his term of office has led to public unrest on many Federal worlds.

Supporters of Shadow President Felicia Winters have taken the lead in protesting against the Hudson Contravention, which is currently being debated in Congress.

The situation has been extensively covered by newsfeeds across the Federation:

Federal Free Press: « As always, Felicia Winters is the only grown-up in the room. She has rightfully objected to the sitting president's attempt at throwing away the rulebook. Repealing the 77th amendment would be a fundamental blow to our millennia-old democracy. »

Sol Today: « What's the choice here? Retain Hudson for a few more years until things calm down, or hand power to Winters and watch the Federal government weaken and collapse under a weight the shadow president cannot possibly bear? »

The Federal Times: « Moderate Republican voters are taking a dim view of the Hudson Contravention, primarily because it denies them the option to choose a new administration. Vice President Jerome Archer, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich and Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa are the most likely presidential candidates, but none of them will be able to run for office in 3309 if Hudson gets his way. »


* Brewer Corp Augments Starport Services
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Further deliveries to Alcor and Colonia are required to add new facilities to the Colonia Bridge starports.

The Colonia Bridge project is currently halfway through its final phase, which takes place over a four-week period. In the previous week, pilots supplied large quantities of performance enhancers, personal weapons and survival equipment.

A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined the next stage:

« Thanks to the hard work of many independent pilots, we have established a Pioneer Supplies outlet, a crew lounge and a search and rescue contact at the five starports along the travel corridor between the core systems and the Colonia region. »

« For week three, our aim is to continue constructing the stations by installing a material trader, concourse bar and mission contract services. These will rely on shipments of computer components, liquor and water purifiers. »

« For pilots who deliver these to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system, Brewer Corporation will be pleased to offer a White Engine Drive Colour and a White Carrier Drive Colour alongside payment in credits. »

Once this week's initiative concludes, week four will aim to complete the Colonia Bridge starports with a full range of services.


* Battle of Summerland Ends NMLA Threat
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Empire has carried out reprisals against the rogue faction Darkwater Inc in the Summerland system.

The private military firm had trained NMLA terrorists and held Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval captive, on the orders of a cabal of senators named the Lords of Restoration.

Darkwater mustered an impressive armada, but these were no match for a combination of superpower forces and independent pilots. Colonel Ronan Brock, the mercenaries' leader, was killed during the fighting when he fled from the Onyx Storm megaship and was shot down by Imperial auxiliaries.

Emperor Arissa praised all those who helped destroy Darkwater, and declared: « Let the Battle of Summerland mark the victorious end of our bitter war against both the NMLA and the traitors who sought to destabilise the Empire. »

ACT clarified that « Although there may always be Neo-Marlinist extremists, the large-scale threat of the NMLA has finally been nullified. » All data obtained from the terrorists' Omega Grid network has now been shared with the relevant security agencies.

With Darkwater eliminated, the Empire has installed a new controlling faction into the Summerland system. The Praetorian Vigil will report directly to the Emperor and govern in her name.

The Summerland Patron's Party will redeem combat bonds and provide other rewards at the starport Henry O'Hare's Hangar. A permit exemption allowing all independent pilots to enter the Summerland system will remain active for the next two weeks.


* Mahon Reprimanded over Reorte Conflict
The Alliance Assembly has delivered an official rebuke to its prime minister following the recent skirmish in the Reorte system.

There have been heated debates following the conflict between Reorte Mining Coalition and Sirius Corporation. This was triggered by the megacorp's unpopular attempt to establish a presence in the system as an anti-xeno defence partner.

Councillor Nakato Kaine led a motion to censure against Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, which successfully passed with a plurality of votes after some abstentions. The strongly-worded reprimand focused on 'disregarding the Alliance's principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation'.

After Mahon formally accepted the reprimand, Councillor Kaine addressed the Assembly:

« This body does not have the right to govern its member systems without their consent. The strategic defence pact must become civil legislation rather than a military contract, so it can be passed as law. »

« I call upon Li Yong-Rui to agree to these terms, or else to abandon the pact and remove Sirius Corporation's forces from the Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian and Leesti systems. »


* Aegis Demands Reinstatement
The leaders of Aegis have formally petitioned the Alliance, Empire and Federation to reform the anti-xeno organisation.

Although all three superpowers are in the process of building their own taskforces to replace Aegis, they have been unable to assist against a recent surge of Thargoid incursions.

Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong gave a statement to the press:

« Surviving members of the leadership council have submitted an appeal to reverse the decision to disband Aegis. The essence of our case is that the superpowers are currently distracted by various internal situations, but the Thargoids care nothing for our politics and must be met with a unified show of force. »

« Aegis support ships have recently been repurposed by other crews in several regions, including the Dan, HIP 12314 and Nauni systems. But they could have been operated officially by our trained personnel, if only we were allowed to do our job. »

« In addition to the increasing Thargoid threat, the rediscovery of the Alexandria in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0 system proves that Azimuth still exists. This sinister group slaughtered four thousand people to obtain Guardian artefacts, and we have logs proving it performed unlicensed xenological research in recent years. Aegis could provide centralised opposition to these criminals as well as defending against alien attack. »


* Final Week for Colonia Bridge Project
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will complete the six starports along the Colonia Bridge.

Months of work on developing the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and the Colonia region are now coming to an end. Brewer Corporation's latest press release specified the requirements:

« For this final week, we are asking pilots to deliver auto-fabricators, micro controllers and resonating separators to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. These will allow us to install outfitting, shipyard and tech broker services, as we bring the starports to full operational status. There is also another opportunity to install Pioneer Supplies at Promium Relay, the bridge starport nearest to Colonia. »

« Brewer Corporation is grateful to independent pilots for their dedication to constructing the Colonia Bridge. We are therefore pleased to offer various classes of pre-engineered, overcharged power plants as well as exploration decals to the top 75% of contributors to this concluding stage. »

« Finally, this is the last chance for pilots to obtain a Brewer Corporation decal, which will be awarded to every contributor to any of the Colonia Bridge initiatives as a token of gratitude. »

The top ten contributors for each of the Colonia Bridge initiatives will have the opportunity to be named in tourist beacons that will commemorate the project's conclusion.


* Hudson Refutes 'Dictatorship' Concerns
President Zachary Hudson has made a public broadcast regarding his proposal to remove the single-term limit of the Federal presidency.

Speaking from the White House on Mars, he directly addressed the anxiety that citizens have expressed about the Hudson Contravention:

« If Congress agrees to temporarily suspend the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, it will mean that I become eligible to stand for election again in 3309. It does not guarantee that I \u2013 or any future president \u2013 can remain in office indefinitely. »

« Furthermore, the Republican Party will be able to field other electoral nominees, as will the Liberal Party and any independent candidates. As always, the votes of the people will determine who forms our government. »

« I strongly believe that our constitution is robust enough to accommodate changes such as this, especially during these trying times. The Federation remains a place of democracy and freedom, not dictatorship. »

President Hudson also called for an end to the recent violence seen at public demonstrations on many Federal worlds. Several cities have witnessed aggressive clashes between Hudson's supporters and those of Shadow President Felicia Winters.


* ACT Disbanded Following Defeat of NMLA
The Alliance, Empire and Federation, have agreed to close down the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit.

A joint statement from all three superpowers stated: « ACT's primary mission to locate and destroy the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army has been successfully accomplished. »

ACT was formed in March 3307 following the Nine Martyrs attacks, when the NMLA simultaneously bombed multiple starports. The independent taskforce rapidly took the lead in investigating the terrorists, calling upon the resources of many agencies, specialists and freelance pilots.

The co-leaders of ACT have now returned to their respective security services. Captain Saskia Landau was personally awarded the Achenar Service Cross by Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, in recognition of her key role in identifying the Lords of Restoration. Landau has now accepted overall command of Imperial Intelligence, reporting directly to the Emperor.

Captain Milo Castile, Inspector Mara Klatt, Praetor Leo Magnus and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez have all been similarly commended for their successes. The joint statement also paid tribute to those members who lost their lives in the fight against terrorism.

ACT was formed under the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which was ratified at the Galactic Summit. The treaty requires governments to cooperate against large-scale threats to civilian populations, and is now commonly viewed as a historic achievement. Since it remains in force, ACT could be reformed in future if a similar threat to the NMLA arises.


* Trial Period Agreed for Alliance-Sirius Pact
The Alliance and Sirius Corporation have negotiated a three-month probationary period for its proposed anti-xeno defence agreement.

In response to a summons by Councillor Nakato Kaine, CEO Li Yong-Rui appeared in person before the Assembly. As part of a longer speech he stated:

« I fully understand that, in order to be effective, the strategic defence pact requires broader political support. But to share its details before the Alliance can experience its benefits may lead to hasty decisions. »

« Instead, we propose that Sirius Corporation is provided with an opportunity to demonstrate how we can enhance Allied security against the Thargoids. At the end of a contractually defined period of time, the Assembly can review the pact and decide whether or not to continue with our partnership. »

Following further discussions, Yong-Rui accepted that the probationary period would be reduced to three months from the originally suggested six. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon expressed his gratitude that a solution had been reached.

Councillor Ainsley Niven, representing the Reorte system, sounded a cautionary note:

« Frankly, some Allied factions won't tolerate Sirius's presence for three minutes let alone three months. I fear that this will not be enough to convince all of our member systems to cooperate. »


* Colonia Bridge Reaches Completion
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Brewer Corporation's project to improve travel between the core systems and Colonia region has successfully concluded.

The final batch of service installations wraps up construction work on the six starports. The following services will be available at Canonn Complex, Helgrind Gateway, Venatores Hub, Vladmir McDoogle's Triumph and Zerreiss Station:

Universal Cartographics \\ Vista Genomics

Pioneer Supplies \\ Bartender

Crew Lounge \\ Search and Rescue

Material Trader \\ Human Tech Broker

Outfitting \\ Shipyard

The following services will be available at Promium Relay:

Universal Cartographics \\ Vista Genomics

Pioneer Supplies \\ Bartender

Material Trader \\ Human Tech Broker

Outfitting \\ Shipyard

Material traders of all types will be represented across the starports.

Newsfeeds were expecting one final press release from Brewer Corporation, but instead received a rare personal message from the company's CEO Madelyn Teague:

« It gives me enormous pleasure to announce a triumphant end for this historic undertaking. I want to thank every single person whose hard work made this dream of mine a reality. The names of those pilots most dedicated to the project will soon be recorded on commemorative beacons in the Alcor and Colonia systems. »

« All of us at Brewer Corporation feel a real sense of pride in the Colonia Bridge. For decades to come, these six starports and 56 megaships will boost trade, support exploration and serve as way-stations for travellers. They represent what can be achieved when so many of us share the same vision and work together in harmony. »

Pilots who delivered materials can now collect payment from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. The top 75% of contributors for the past week can also collect their pre-engineered overcharged power plant modules on the 11th of March.


* Imperial Guard Defends Duvals
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has ordered the Imperial Guard to provide increased security to surviving members of the Duval dynasty.

Many Imperial Family members, including Prince Harold, were assassinated by the NMLA. Sources close to Emperor Arissa state that she is determined to preserve the remaining Duval bloodline as well as deter any future attacks.

The Imperial Guard is a legion of elite warriors under the direct control of the Emperor. Although typically seen performing ceremonial duties, they are a highly trained fighting force. It is understood that their numbers have been boosted by a focused enlistment drive from other areas of the Imperial military.

A cohort of Imperial Guard has been placed at the service of Princess Aisling Duval. She has gratefully accepted their presence and integrated them with her existing security team.

Similar squads have been posted to the households of Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval and Lucretia Roche-Duval, both of whom are descended from the siblings of Emperor Hesketh. Legionnaires were also assigned to direct relations of Emperor Arissa, including her prominent cousins Admiral Lucius Lavigny and Countess Guinevere Lavigny.

Only Hadrian Duval declined the offer of additional protection, stating that he will rely on his Praetorian Guard. He reassured his followers that a hand-picked corps permanently surrounds his infant son Hector Duval.


* Reorte Mining Coalition Proposes Independence
The Reorte Mining Coalition wants to cut ties with the Alliance in protest against the military defence pact with Sirius Corporation.

Vox Galactica featured an announcement from the faction's CEO, Fergus Cassidy:

« The pact's three-month probationary period is clearly a ruse. It is designed to allow time for Sirius agents to bribe, convince or threaten Allied decision-makers into accepting Li Yong-Rui's presence. We'd rather become an independent faction than allow this greedy and untrustworthy company into Reorte space. »

Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents Reorte, told the Assembly:

« Obviously I have argued against this extreme move, but I cannot ignore the strength of feeling from the system's governing faction. For Reorte Mining Coalition leaders, leaving the Alliance is less risky than allowing Sirius Corporation to become embedded in the system's infrastructure. »

Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported:

« There are already wild rumours that this situation might spark mass declarations of independence, similar to the Federation's secession crisis last year. But there is no indication as yet that these events will play out quite so dramatically. »

« What is certain, however, is how damaging this is for Prime Minister Mahon's campaign to promote acceptance of Sirius Corporation. A historically significant system such as Reorte withdrawing from the Alliance would likely sour the megacorp's reputation with those it seeks to impress. »


* Bounties Placed on Criminal Faction
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Federal authorities have requested help in hunting down a notorious pirate gang in the Gliese 868 system.

The call to arms was broadcast by the faction Gliese 868 Services:

« Recently, most Federal security services have been focused on dealing with political protests. This provided opportunities for criminals to cause havoc, by raiding trade convoys and committing piracy against ships throughout the region. »

« With the aid of Congressional funding, we have initiated a campaign to destroy all wanted vessels operating within our system. Independent pilots are requested to help us eliminate the threat that these criminals pose and claim the bounties placed on them. »

In a statement to the newsfeed, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich said:

« Public interest in the Hudson Contravention is intense, with feelings running high on both sides. But it is regrettable that this has tied up our security forces and given free rein to these felons. All members of Congress have agreed that, with the support of the galactic community, we must make an example of them to deter further criminality. »

Bounty vouchers can be redeemed at Bacon Port in Gliese 868. The campaign is expected to run until the 24th of March 3308.


* Alliance Strives to Retain Reorte
The megaship Trobairitz has arrived in the Reorte system to support the efforts of the Reorte Pro-Alliance League.

In recent weeks, the Reorte system has forced the expulsion of Sirius Corporation and refused to accept the strategic defence pact. Since then, there have been proposals from its controlling faction to renounce Allied membership and declare independence. But this has galvanised others to campaign for Reorte to remain in the Alliance.

Louisa Leblanc, chief administrator of the Reorte Pro-Alliance League, gave a statement to The Alliance Tribune:

« The proposed partnership with Sirius Corporation Is restricted to increasing defences against the Thargoids. We do not believe this will be disruptive enough to justify losing all the myriad benefits of membership in the Alliance. »

« The Reorte Pro-Alliance League is pleased to be supported by the Alioth Independents faction. A megaship, the Trobairitz, has been supplied to us and will serve as the centre of our campaign for Reorte to remain an Allied system. »

Sirius Corporation has officially stated that this situation is an internal matter for the Alliance. Sources within the Alioth Independents suggest that Sirius Corporation delegates has been briefed on the situation.


* Arissa Convenes Key Imperial Figures
Various Imperial allies, ambassadors and nobles have been summoned to Capitol for a series of meetings with Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho provided details for The Imperial Herald:

« There are rumours of many behind-the-scenes changes among the upper echelons of power since Emperor Arissa returned. But this latest event was mostly in the public eye and seemed designed to reassure the citizens of her physical presence. »

« Members from all echelons of the Imperial aristocracy arrived at the palace with their entourages. Court ceremonies were held to reaffirm their fealty to Emperor Arissa, all with as much spectacle and grandeur as possible. »

« Less public were Arissa's closed sessions with representatives from the Imperial Diplomatic Corps. Laurentin Sharpe, the Empire's senior ambassador to the Alliance, said: 'The purpose of these briefings is to update Her Majesty on political developments that occurred during her absence, and to receive guidance for the future.' »

« Alongside the parade of familiar faces was one very unexpected figure: Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate. His megaship, Fairfax Vision, was afforded full diplomatic immunity when it arrived in the Achenar system. Considering the turbulent history between the Empire and the Marlinist Colonies, what might Arissa be planning? »


* Taurus Mining Ventures Begins Scientific Study
The megaships Musashi and Heart of Taurus have entered the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system to perform a mining-related research operation.

Taurus Mining Ventures is an independent mining corporation closely associated with Salvation. It has acted as his intermediary in recent months, directly supporting his efforts to combat the Thargoids.

Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of the company's research division, provided a statement:

« We have recorded some unusual radioactive signatures in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system. This has had a transformative effect on the molecular structure of certain naturally occurring substances. »

« Our objective is to perform a detailed analysis of these irradiated materials and determine if they have value as mineable resources. Customised laboratories have been set up aboard both megaships, and work is already underway. »

The Empirical, an independent journal aimed at the scientific community, commented:

« As yet, the detection of atypical radiation signatures within CE-R c21-6 has not been verified by secondary sources. Our editorial team has reached out to Taurus Mining Ventures for clarification. »


* Rival Initiatives to Decide Reorte's Future
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries to the Reorte Mining Coalition or the Reorte Pro-Alliance League will help determine the system's status.

The system's controlling faction wishes to declare independence, in protest against Sirius Corporation's proposed anti-xeno defence pact with the Alliance Defence Force.

The Reorte Mining Coalition's CEO Fergus Cassidy announced:

« Prime Minister Mahon's insistence on working with Sirius leads us to believe our interests are best served outside of the Alliance. To prepare for Reorte's potential transition to an independent system, we ask for shipments of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building fabricators to be delivered to Davies High starport. »

It is expected that if Reorte Mining Coalition is successful, all systems currently under its governance would similarly be classified as independent.

Another faction in the system, the Reorte Pro-Alliance League, broadcast a statement in opposition by chief administrator Louisa Leblanc:

« Severing Reorte's links with the Alliance over some misguided idealism would be hasty and short-sighted, given the Thargoid threat this pact is intended to prepare for. We believe that increasing supplies of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building fabricators will reassure the public of the benefits of membership. »

« The Alioth Independents faction has kindly provided a megaship, the Trobairitz, where pilots can deliver these commodities. »

Although Sirius Corporation is not officially involved with these competing initiatives, it is offering pre-engineered heat sink modules to independent pilots who make deliveries to the Trobairitz.


* Criminal Forces Crushed in Gliese 868
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Commanders have worked alongside Federal authorities to destroy criminal ships in the Gliese 868 system.

The pirate gang was responsible for multiple raids while Federal security services were distracted by public protests around the Hudson Contravention. To help protect shipping and eliminate the threat, bounties were placed on all criminal vessels.

Gliese 868 Services, which organised the counter-offensive against the pirates, announced:

« The combat expertise of Federal Navy auxiliaries and independent pilots has succeeded in driving back these ruthless criminals. We will be pleased to reimburse bounty vouchers at Bacon Port in Gliese 868. »

The Federal Times reported on the political repercussions from these events:

« It is not just the security agencies that are embarrassed at relying on volunteers to protect trade in Gliese 868. Members of both the Republican and Liberal Parties have spoken out, claiming that this situation was completely unacceptable. »

« This has led to fresh demands that President Hudson's proposal to repeal the 77th amendment must be negotiated peacefully, without causing civil disturbance or placing citizens' lives at risk. Congress is expected to make further statements soon. »


* Taurus Prepares Mining Operation
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Plans for a new mining initiative by Taurus Mining Ventures in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system have been announced.

The corporation's megaship Heart of Taurus has been conducting scientific studies on 'unusual radioactive signatures' within the system. The next phase of this work is to identify mineable resources to learn more about the radiation's effects.

Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of the Taurus Mining Ventures research division, provided an update:

« The source of the radiation found in Synuefe CE-R c21-6 has not yet been unidentified. But our team has theorised that naturally occurring ores in the system may have altered properties. If we are correct, that ore may have high commercial value once processed into usable metals and minerals. »

A public statement was delivered by Commodore Morag Halloran:

« It is paramount that we maintain positive relations with the community of independent pilots. Therefore, Taurus Mining Ventures will subcontract the forthcoming operation to members of the Pilots' Federation. The company will be pleased to offer suitable rewards for mining these irradiated materials, details of which will be specified by Dr Carpenter in the next few days. »


* Empire Reaches Out to Marlinists
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has outlined a plan for the Marlinist Colonies to be officially reconnected with the Empire.

The Marlin Standard published an exclusive report from Prime Consul Kayode Tau, after he attended a diplomatic meeting on Capitol:

« The essence of Emperor Arissa's proposal is a pledge to grant the status of Imperial protectorate to the Marlinist Colonies, in return for swearing allegiance to the throne. »

« In practice, local government would remain autonomous but the Imperial Navy and security agencies would have a permanent presence. There would be investment in trade, with Empire-based companies as preferred partners. New channels of transportation and communication would be opened between Marlinist and Imperial systems. »

« Emperor Arissa and I discussed the issues at length. Following her experience with the Lords of Restoration, Her Majesty now accepts that most believers in Marlinism are not terrorists or revolutionaries. She has, however, insisted that the Empire must be watchful for any Neo-Marlinist resurgence. »

« When I broached the topic that some senators had suggested absorbing the Marlinist Colonies by force, the Emperor assured me there would be no military action. She spoke of her 'need to cleanse the wounds left by the NMLA', and I believe this is a genuine sentiment. »

The Marlinist Parliament has received full details of the proposal and is preparing a response.


* Reorte System Remains Allied
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Reorte Pro-Alliance League's success over the Reorte Mining Coalition means the system will stay in the Alliance.

A greater quantity of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building fabricators were delivered to the Trobairitz megaship than to the opposing faction. As a result, Reorte will remain an Allied system.

Pilots who contributed to the Reorte Pro-Alliance League's initiative can now collect their rewards at the Trobairitz, along with the additional pre-engineered heat sink modules provided by Sirius Corporation.

Chief Administrator Louisa Leblanc proclaimed:

« I am deeply grateful to all those who helped convince our people that Reorte's future is more secure with the Alliance. We look forward to working alongside Sirius Corporation on increasing defences against the Thargoids. »

The Reorte Mining Coalition's CEO Fergus Cassidy expressed his regret that their campaign to renounce membership of the Alliance failed to gather the necessary support. He thanked those who supported them, and confirmed that credit rewards for contributing pilots are now available at Davies High starport.


* Taurus Mining Ventures Calls for Support
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Taurus Mining Ventures has requested help with a mining and delivery operation in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system.

In recent weeks, the mining corporation has performed research on what it claims are atypical radiation signatures detected within Synuefe CE-R c21-6. It now seeks shipments of the system's native ores to explore commercially valuable applications of any molecular changes caused by this radiation.

Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of the company's research division, outlined the initiative:

« I'm very excited to offer pilots this opportunity to support our scientific studies, which will hopefully prove lucrative for all involved. We require coltan, lithium hydroxide and methanol monohydrate crystal to be mined from locations within Synuefe CE-R c21-6 and delivered to the Heart of Taurus megaship. »

« We will also pay for shipments of the same ores that have been mined from other systems. These will allow us to compare samples, in order to refine our commercial processes. »

Taurus Mining Ventures is known for its close association with the anonymous anti-xeno specialist known as Salvation. However, there is no indication that this mining operation is connected to Salvation's efforts to combat the Thargoids.


* Hudson Contravention Vote is Suspended
Federal Congress has temporarily postponed making a decision on whether to extend presidential term limits.

President Zachary Hudson had proposed to repeal the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, which specifies that a president can serve for a maximum of eight years. If approved, Hudson would become eligible for re-election in June 3309.

A statement was delivered by President Hudson:

« I have agreed that more time is needed to analyse the potential repercussions of this change to the Federation's constitution. A congressional subcommittee will perform a detailed inquiry to investigate the civil and legal aspects. »

« In addition, I am very conscious of the public disturbances caused by the Hudson Contravention. This delay should help to defuse political tension and provide our security services with an opportunity to keep the peace. »

Shadow President Winters welcomed the president's decision, and spoke of her eagerness to read the subcommittee's report.


* Marlinists Hold Public Referendum
The population of the Marlinist Colonies will vote to accept or decline the offer to become an Imperial protectorate.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's proposal aims to build links between the independent colony systems and the Empire, from where the Marlinists originally fled as political refugees in 3306.

The Marlin Standard ran an editorial summarising the situation:

« Should the Marlinist Colonies remain an isolated republican society, or should we move beneath the Empire's protective wing? It's a question that most of us never expected to be asked. »

« Many expressed fierce anger that Emperor Arissa has dared to ask for our allegiance. In her desperation to hunt down the NMLA she persecuted all believers in Marlinism, arresting thousands and displacing millions of her own citizens. Can we now trust her to welcome us back? »

« Others are concerned that the Marlinist Colonies remain vulnerable, claiming that becoming a satellite nation of the Empire would provide military defences as well as economic boosts. And for those still holding on to their past lives, the attraction of reconnecting with friends and family in the Empire is strong. »

« Whatever the outcome, First Minister Octavia Volkov's swift decision to put this issue to a referendum is a splendid example of Marlinism in action. Votes are already being cast, and the result will be revealed at the end of this week. »


* Taurus Mining Ventures Operation Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A corporate initiative to mine and deliver ores to the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system has ended successfully.

Taurus Mining Ventures had performed scientific research within the system, claiming that the properties of some natural substances had been altered by an unknown type of local radiation.

The company's head of research Dr Ruben Carpenter announced:

« We now have sufficiently large quantities of coltan, lithium hydroxide and methanol monohydrate crystals mined from locations in Synuefe CE-R c21-6. These irradiated ores will be analysed to determine their potential commercial value. Samples that were provided from other systems will also be very useful in our comparative studies. »

« To all the pilots who assisted in this endeavour: thank you! Your hard work is greatly appreciated. The Heart of Taurus megaship will remain in Synuefe CE-R c21-6 for several weeks, and you may collect your rewards from there. »

Taurus Mining Ventures confirmed that studies to identify the source, effects and application of the local radiation are continuing. The scientific journal The Empirical has reiterated that these 'atypical radioactive signatures' have not been independently verified.


* Marlinists Reject Emperor's Offer
A public referendum in the Marlinist Colonies has resulted in the majority voting to remain fully independent from the Empire.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval had proposed to make the colony systems an Imperial protectorate in return for Marlinist allegiance to the Imperial throne. This would have permitted an autonomous government while creating many civil and military links.

First Minister Octavia Volkov announced the referendum's results in the Marlinist Parliament:

« Our people have given us a clear mandate: the colonies stand alone. In accordance with the key principles of Marlinism, we reject monarchy rule in favour of republican governance and direct representation. »

« Most of us are still haunted by the trauma of becoming refugees in 3306, when millions of innocent Marlinists were accused of supporting terrorist acts. We fled from an Empire that had become intolerant and abusive. This cannot be so easily forgotten. »

« Nevertheless, we recognise that approximately a quarter of our population voted to accept the Emperor's proposal. The ties to our homelands remain strong, and we still share much culture and history with the Empire. But the will of the masses is evident. »

« I offer my thanks to Her Majesty for extending this offer, and call upon her to recognise and respect the decision of the Marlinist Colonies. »


* Arissa Accepts Marlinists' Independence
Following a referendum by the Marlinist Colonies, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has formally recognised their autonomous status.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate reported on his latest meeting with the Emperor:

« Her Majesty was clearly uncomfortable with the democratic way in which the ex-Imperial citizens in the colonies now govern themselves. But she gracefully acknowledged that the Marlinist population had declined her invitation to become an Imperial protectorate, and would thus remain independent. »

« However, there was a proviso to Emperor Arissa's acceptance of the decision. She insisted that the Marlinist Colonies must work with the Empire's intelligence agencies to prevent any resurgence of the NMLA or similar terrorist groups. »

It has since been agreed that Imperial Intelligence and the Marlinist Constabulary would collaborate on identifying Neo-Marlinist extremists. Colonel Saskia Landau and Major Milo Castile, both former co-leaders of ACT, have agreed to work together once again.

In recognition of the minority who voted to rejoin the Empire, dedicated customs and immigration channels for registered Marlinist citizens will soon be established.


* Sirius Defends Alliance Territory
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation megaships will soon arrive in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas to provide anti-xeno support.

The three vessels are intended as a demonstration of Sirius Corporation's military capabilities, prior to the strategic defence pact being ratified by the Alliance Assembly.

A public statement was provided by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Alliance Council of Admirals:

« The Coalsack Nebula and Witch Head Nebula regions are where Alliance interests are most at risk from Thargoid attack. From tomorrow, our megaships will serve as bases from which anti-xeno operations can be conducted. »

« All ships in the area are invited to make use of the Song of Mecchi in the Coalsack Sector Vu-O B6-6 system, the Kandula's Truth in the Siniang system, and the Li Chyou Winds in the Onoros system. »

« As a further gesture of our dedication to protecting the Alliance, these megaships will offer a unique pre-engineered heat sink module. We trust that this will prove especially useful to those brave pilots who face the Thargoids in combat. »


* Support Required for New Marlinist Starports
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A delivery campaign in the HIP 22550 system will help build additional starports for the Marlinist Colonies.

First Minister Octavia Volkov delivered this public address:

« The Marlinist Colonies were born out of desperation, but we have evolved into a fully fledged society. Emperor Arissa has formally accepted our status as an autonomous democracy, albeit one that retains cultural and historical ties with the Empire. »

« To celebrate and consolidate our independence, we have launched an initiative to construct up to six new orbital stations. For all those who wish to take part, we require shipments of aluminium, computer components, power generators and titanium to be transported to Stillman Hub starport. »

« I am also delighted to announce that Universal Cartographics has approved our petition to rename the original eight systems of the Marlinist Colonies. These are expected to officially change in the near future. »

The Free Marlinists of Carinae faction has confirmed that it will offer rewards to pilots who deliver the necessary materials to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.


* Rackham for President?
Multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham has discussed standing as an independent candidate for the Federal presidency in 3309.

The issue was raised during the opening of a new superstructure named Rackham's Spire on Homeland in the Beta Hydri system. At a press conference in the tropospheric suite, Mr Rackham was asked for his views on the proposed Hudson Contravention.

He replied by light-heartedly hinting that he might run for office himself: « With two Zacharys on the ballot, I'm guaranteed to get some votes by mistake! »

Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco wrote an opinion piece for The Federal Times:

« Rackham's Spire literally stabs the sky above Los Pioneros, rising so high that during the day its shadow moves across the city like a colossal sundial. Extravagant, expensive and impossible to ignore, it's practically an altar to the man who built it. »

« I've spent half of my career investigating Rackham, and I'm convinced that he always has an ulterior motive. In this case it seems obvious: by laughing off suggestions about standing for election, he makes people expect it to become true. It's blatantly the first step to a forthcoming campaign. »

« It still mystifies me how Rackham makes people forget his past. Most newsfeeds refuse to acknowledge his former identity as Calico Zack, one of the last century's most notorious pirates. All they portray is the wealthy and successful businessman \u2013 and now, perhaps, a future president of the Federation. »


* Salvation Strengthens Bonds with Superpowers
The anonymous anti-xeno scientist Salvation has received further military support from the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

Multiple official sources have highlighted the increasing number of crew members being seconded from the Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy. Previously, enlisted members had been forced to resign their commissions, but regulatory changes now permit temporarily serving on vessels owned by Salvation's commercial partner Taurus Mining Ventures.

One of the recent volunteers, Lieutenant Andrew Jones, was quoted by Vox Galactica:

« Most of us are here because it feels like Salvation is the only one taking the fight to the Thargoids. Now that Aegis is as good as gone, he's our best hope for stopping these aliens before they wipe us all out. »

Other non-naval recruits from the superpowers are providing support in intelligence, logistics and security. A number of specialists are alleged to be working directly with Salvation on his anti-xeno superweapons, which are derived from Guardian technology.

In related news, scientific research journal The Empirical reported that no evidence of atypical radiation has been detected in the Synuefe CE-R C21-6 system. This has raised questions as to the purpose of Taurus Mining Ventures's recent mining operation.


* Yong-Rui: 'History Will Judge Sirius'
The CEO of Sirius Corporation has addressed public concerns regarding its anti-xeno defence pact with the Alliance.

Li Yong-Rui's comments were made during an in-depth interview with The Alliance Tribune:

« The best way to predict the future is to study the past. This is as true of interstellar organisations as it is of individuals \u2013 our former actions indicate the probability of behaviour. So I invite you to study the role that Sirius Corporation has previously played on the political stage. »

« Ever since the Battle of Achenar and the widespread conflicts of the 2300s, our neutrality has allowed us to mediate between the Empire and the Federation on many occasions. More recently, we defused inter-power tensions by establishing the Marlinist Colonies, which provided permanent homes for millions of refugees. »

« It should also not be overlooked that the Galactic Summit was hosted in the Sirius system, where we encouraged humanity's leaders to peacefully debate their differences. Furthermore, our development of the frame shift drive has revolutionised exploration and allowed many independent societies to flourish. »

« Some continue to cast aspersions on our strategic partnership with the Alliance, and I fully understand their caution. The fear that corporations can only act self-servingly is born from a millennium of notable examples. But it is history that will judge Sirius Corporation's efforts to defend and preserve civilisation. I truly hope the Alliance will play a significant role in those efforts. »


* Marlinist Colonies Receive Starport Resources
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The construction of new Marlinist starports has begun after materials were delivered to the HIP 22550 system.

Enough shipments of aluminium, computer components, power generators and titanium were received at Stillman Hub to facilitate the building of 2 orbital stations. These are expected to become operational by the 5th of May 3308.

The campaign's conclusion was marked by a statement from First Minister Octavia Volkov:

« Not for the first time in our turbulent history, we are indebted to all pilots who have shown support for the Marlinist Colonies. With these additional starports, we can increase local commerce and contribute to the wider economy. »

« It is my sincere hope that our handful of systems will one day form the nucleus of a Marlinist Republic, which can peacefully co-exist alongside our Imperial cousins. »

The Free Marlinists of Carinae faction is now rewarding all pilots who took part in this initiative at Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.

In related news, Prime Consul Kayode Tau has been invited to establish an office of the Marlinist Consulate on Capitol. This is being widely viewed as a sign of increased diplomatic tolerance from the Emperor.


* Superpower Systems Overrun by Thargoids
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Thargoid fleets have invaded the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems, placing over ten billion lives at risk.

Local security services in all three systems have reported overwhelming numbers of hostile Thargoid vessels. Several starports have been directly attacked with caustic enzyme weapons, and the combined death toll is already in the hundreds of thousands.

Didio, Novas and Sosong are members of the Alliance, Empire and Federation respectively. Three admirals have been selected to mount a defence: Henry Paul Atherton of the Imperial Navy, Maxton Price of the Federal Navy and Rachel Ziegler of the Alliance Defence Force.

However, it will be days before each can marshal sufficient forces. Therefore the factions Emperor's Grace, LTT 4772 Alliance Mandate and Union of Sosong Democrats have sent out emergency calls for assistance to all independent pilots.

With Aegis now officially disbanded, its fleet is being temporarily operated by Frontline Solutions. The combat logistics corporation has made the ships available with a volunteer pilot force, which will support the superpowers in systems invaded by Thargoid fleets. Sources indicate a more permanent solution is being sought, as Frontline Solutions CEO Imogen le Ray is believed to be resistant to a long-term commitment of her company's resources to the anti-xeno effort.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation are currently liaising with Salvation, whose unique weaponry has proved effective against Thargoid incursions of similar magnitude. As yet, Salvation has made no public statement.


* Rackham Consolidates in Beta Hydri
The Beta Hydri system has become the commercial and political headquarters of wealthy entrepreneur Zachary Rackham.

The Tau Ceti Journal reported that Rackham Capital Investments owns a majority of shares in the Beta Hydri Corporation, the system's controlling faction. As a member of its board of directors, Rackham has had a role in governing the system for many months.

At a press conference, a spokesperson for Rackham Capital Investments said:

« Mr Rackham was born on the planet Homeland, so he is enthusiastic about giving back to his former community. For example, building Rackham's Spire helped revive the construction industry in Los Pioneros. We have also invested in several local companies, such as the Luxe Somptueux hotel chain \u2013 now rebranded as Rackham's Rooms \u2013 and MacArthur Mining Ltd. »

Several newsfeeds asked if Rackham's political position in Beta Hydri paved the way for running as an independent candidate in next year's presidential election. However, the spokesperson declined to comment.

The Federal Times's coverage of the story included an observation by financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:

« As far as my research can tell, Zachary Rackham's citizenship documents have never been made public or independently verified. My guess is that Calico Zack wasn't born in the Federation at all, but hails from some anarchic backwater where piracy is a way of life. »


* Sirius Vows to Defend Alliance
Sirius Corporation has claimed that the recent Thargoid incursions prove the necessity of its strategic defence pact with the Alliance.

The Didio, Novas and Sosong systems are currently withstanding a coordinated attack from large numbers of Thargoid vessels. Independent pilots have rushed to their aid while the three superpowers prepare their respective fleet responses.

A press conference was held by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the liaison between the Alliance Defence Force and the Sirius Navy:

« This unexpected onslaught only underlines the Alliance's need for military support. The Thargoids can strike anywhere at any time, and Allied systems such as Didio are vulnerable. Only with Sirius Corporation's help can we ensure their safety. »

Journalists pointed out that the Council of Admirals had selected Admiral Rachel Ziegler to lead their anti-xeno taskforce instead of Admiral Glass, despite that being his specific area of expertise. He replied:

« Well, as you know, the pact is still within its trial period and hasn't yet been ratified by the Assembly. So there are limits to how involved Sirius Corporation can be at this stage. I'm sure my colleague will do a fine job while I focus on providing broader support to the Didio system, such as additional secondments to Salvation's fleet. »


* Kumo Crew Appoints New Council Leader
Archon Delaine has announced that pirate leader Callan Salamanca is the newest member of the Kumo Council's upper echelon.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling provided an overview for Vox Galactica:

« The Kumo Council was formed by Archon Delaine to delegate his control over the criminal syndicate. Each member has the title of corsair, and oversees a region or system within his territory. But Delaine's most trusted advisers, known as arch-corsairs, work with him on strategic goals. »

« The latest addition is the son of Gideon 'Soulless' Salamanca, one of the most infamous warlords in the Pegasi sector. Following Salamanca's unexpected death from a cardiac event, Delaine has elevated Callan to take his father's place on the council, despite the young man's reputation for impulsive behaviour. »

« Two others remain in the council's inner circle. Vidar Trask has been close to Delaine for many years and is known to be an expert administrator. Kay Volantyne was originally part of the Blue Viper Club dredger clan, before she negotiated its alliance with the Kumo Crew. »

« Delaine continues to style himself as the 'sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation', striving for an air of legitimacy. The Kumo Council reinforces this approach, but is often called upon to justify or deny their regent's brutal excesses. With rumours that Callan Salamanca is already misusing his newfound authority, this delicate balance might prove to be unsustainable. »


* Marlinist Refugees Migrate from Alliance
Over two million ex-Imperial citizens who sought sanctuary with the Alliance are now being repatriated to the Marlinist Colonies.

Ambassador Elijah Beck, head of the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations, announced:

« Political refugees from Imperial systems have been arriving since late 3306, following the Empire's crackdown on Marlinism. At the time they had no legal status or resources, and relied entirely upon the charity of local factions for their survival. »

« Our successful negotiations with the Marlinist Consulate have now led to a solution. The Assembly will fund safe passage to the Marlinist Colonies for all refugees in Allied space. Pending security checks, they will be granted full citizenship. »

The decision was welcomed by First Minister Octavia Volkov:

« Thanks to the Alliance's generosity, any Marlinists currently within their territory can now take advantage of free transportation to a colony system of their choice. There we will provide state support and work opportunities, to help them establish new permanent homes. »

« More than a million people who fled the Empire are still unaccounted for, having dispersed throughout the core systems. I call for them to contact us via the consulate, and join our growing republican society. »


* Sirius Initiative Plans Aid for Alliance
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has organised humanitarian support for the Didio system, which is under attack by Thargoid vessels.

The Alliance Defence Fleet is currently combating the Thargoid threat in Didio, under the command of Admiral Rachel Ziegler.

Admiral Nikolas Glass, who acts as a liaison between the megacorp and the Alliance Defence Force, provided details of the campaign:

« With the strategic defence pact yet to be ratified, the Council of Admirals has not approved the deployment of Sirius Navy ships as part of an Allied fleet. However, Sirius Corporation is keen to show its commitment to helping the Alliance, and will do so by supplying vital resources to the Didio system's besieged population. »

« Large quantities of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food cartridges are urgently required. These can be delivered to the megaship Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system, from where they will be delivered to Didio in military convoys. »

Sirius Corporation has been criticised for not providing similar support to the Novas and Sosong systems, which have also been invaded. A spokesperson for the megacorp stated that the strategic defence pact's trial applies exclusively to the Alliance. Any similar relationship with the Empire and Federation would require separate negotiations, though the spokesperson stressed that Li Yong-Rui has no interest in such talks at this time.

A joint operation between the superpowers is currently underway in Didio, Novas and Sosong to counter recent Thargoid invasions. This is to buy time for Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons to be constructed.


* Superpowers Employ Pilots to Hunt Thargoids
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Alliance, Empire and Federation are offering bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems.

Commodore Morag Halloran, who coordinates Salvation's military forces, broadcast this message on public channels:

« Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to expunge the latest Thargoid infestation. He estimates two more weeks before these devices become operational. Until that time, it is vital that we keep the Thargoids at bay to minimise civilian casualties. »

The anti-xeno taskforces of the Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy are cooperating on a joint operation to buy time for the superweapons to be completed. This includes rewarding independent pilots for defending the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems.

Commanders can hand in combat bonds for Thargoid kills until the 12th of May 3308 at these three locations: the megaship Plymouth Howl in the Ch'anjie system, Sturckow Orbital in the Lesheima system, and Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.

Each superpower has also deployed a capital ship to the invaded systems: the Allied megaship Salote Charm in Didio, the Majestic-class interdictor INV Succession in Novas, and the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Amphion in Sosong.

Jade Sanderlyn, a reporter for Vox Galactica, has been granted permission to interview the admirals in command of the taskforces. Her conversations with Henry Paul Atherton, Maxton Price and Rachel Ziegler are being broadcast by the capital ships and will be syndicated via newsfeeds.


* The Sanderlyn Interviews (Part One)
The journalist Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica was recently invited to conduct rare public interviews with admirals of the three superpowers.

This excerpt is from a conversation with Admiral Henry Paul Atherton of the Empire.

Jade Sanderlyn: This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. I am sitting with Admiral Henry Paul Atherton of the Imperial Navy. Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Admiral.

 Henry Paul Atherton: Oh, please. Call me Henry.

JS: I'd be delighted to. This is a very impressive ship, Henry.

HPA: Some might say Majestic. [laughs] Yes, the Succession is a wonderful vessel.

JS: How long have you commanded her?

HPA: Several years now. It has been an honour to have my name listed on the Succession's exemplary service record.

JS: You were promoted to admiral only three years ago. Does that change the personal dynamic with your crew at all?

HPA: Well, they salute a little faster, I suppose. Happily I enjoy a strong relationship with my officers, so they took the change fully in stride.

JS: Let's talk about Novas. I understand that the Imperial Navy has deployed a fleet here at Salvation's request.

HPA: That's correct.

JS: Emperor Arissa recently resumed her duties following\u2026 an extended absence from the throne. Having now surely been briefed on Salvation's work, does the Emperor endorse Salvation?

HPA: If the Emperor had objections, her navy would not be in Novas.

JS: What are your objectives in the system?

HPA: Well, in case it has gone unnoticed, there is a major Thargoid invasion occurring here. It is our duty to protect civilian populations and prevent the loss of strategic assets.

JS: I'm pleased that you mentioned civilian lives first. Does Salvation share this approach?

HPA: Almost certainly. Why else would he invest so much effort into his marvellous superweapon if not to protect people?

JS: Some have claimed that Salvation prioritises victory over safety.

HPA: Jade, dear: they are the same thing. The cost of war is human lives, and the Thargoids extract a heavy toll. Every invaded system. Every burning starport. Every ambushed convoy. Every ship lost to hyperspace. We have repeatedly driven the Thargoids back from our space, but the wretched things keep returning. That cost grows each day. Salvation's superweapon has proven effective at wiping Thargoids from entire systems at a stroke. If Salvation calls that victory while you and I call it saving lives, then I'm comfortable with the difference in perspective.

JS: Thank you for elaborating. Let's take a break. We'll be back after these messages.

The rest of this interview is available to pilots arriving at the INV Succession in the Novas system.


* The Sanderlyn Interviews (Part Two)
The journalist Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica was recently invited to conduct rare public interviews with admirals of the three superpowers.

This excerpt is from a conversation with Admiral Maxton Price of the Federation.

Jade Sanderlyn: My name is Jade Sanderlyn, reporting for Vox Galactica. I'm here with Admiral Maxton Price, onboard the FNS Amphion in the Sosong system. I was very impressed with the tour of the ship prior to our interview, Admiral.

Maxton Price: I can't say I'm surprised, Miss Sanderlyn. Is this your first time on a Farragut-class battle cruiser?

JS: Yes. It's one the reasons I was so excited that my interview request had been granted. The Amphion is just as impressive as I'd hoped.

MP: That's gracious of you to say. Of course, the Farragut-class vessels value performance over aesthetics. It's a lesson our Imperial friends would do well to learn one day.

JS: I take it, then, that you consider yourself a utilitarian?

MP: In military matters, what other philosophy is there? A sleek ship will turn heads and attract investors, but when something dangerous enters your space, most soldiers would choose a powerful response over a pretty one.

JS: Which brings us to the current conflict in this system. The Federal fleet has been asked to contain the Thargoid threat while Salvation prepares his anti-xeno superweapon.

MP: And I have no doubt that we will succeed. Federal military power is as strong as it's ever been. Funding provided by the Hudson administration over the past seven years has allowed us to expand and modernise our fleet. It's a pleasant time to be an admiral.

JS: I presume that you are in favour of Salvation's work.

MP: Wholeheartedly. His results speak volumes to a man like me. The anti-xeno superweapon has incredible range, a devastating impact on Thargoid craft, and is harmless to our own ships. What's not to like?

JS: Aside from independent studies by the engineer Ram Tah, we have very limited information about the weapon. We also know nothing about its long-term effects on human physiology. Do you think there is any risk to the public?

MP: Let me ask you a question, Miss Sanderlyn. Do you think this hypothetical health risk poses a greater danger to the general public than a Thargoid fleet crawling through a populated system?

JS: No, but surely the lack of transparency\u2026

MP: No, it does not. I've seen what the Thargoids are capable of. It's impressive, it's scary and it results in considerable loss of life if not dealt with quickly. Salvation has proven he can achieve significant victories for an entire system. Timid hand-wringing over the future is fine with me, once we've secured a future in which to do so.

JS: Let's take a break for a word from our sponsors. We'll be right back.

The rest of this interview is available to pilots arriving at the FNS Amphion in the Sosong system.


* The Sanderlyn Interviews (Part Three)
The journalist Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica was recently invited to conduct rare public interviews with admirals of the three superpowers.

This excerpt is from a conversation with Admiral Rachel Ziegler of the Alliance.

Jade Sanderlyn: This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. I am here with Admiral Rachel Ziegler of the Alliance. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you, Admiral.

 Rachel Ziegler: You're welcome.

JS: We're on board the Salote Charm, which is currently stationed in the Didio system. Two days ago, a large Thargoid force arrived here and began attacking human ships and ports. There are reports that Salvation has asked your fleet, and those of the other superpowers, to hold the Thargoid force at bay until the anti-xeno superweapon\u2026

RZ: Let me clarify your question before you finish it. My priority is the safety of the billions who call Didio home. We are not here to keep the Thargoid forces occupied. We are here to defeat them.

JS: Understood, Admiral. Salvation has asked for time to prepare his superweapon, though?

RZ: Yes, he has. But the Alliance does not operate with the assumption that Salvation will deliver on his promise.

JS: Do you support Salvation's methods? Critics have suggested he endangers lives by using a powerful weapon that has not been independently assessed by experts.

RZ: Whether I support or do not support Salvation is immaterial. The fact is that, on two previous occasions, the superweapon has eliminated Thargoid fleets from entire systems. Rejecting such a powerful device would be unwise. Still, I think the question of risk is wholly appropriate. Military and political figures alike must not become complacent or over-reliant on Salvation's technology. Particularly when we know so little about it.

JS: Is that ambiguity a concern for the Alliance?

RZ: It should be a concern for everybody. So far, Salvation has acted in our best interests. But a weapon that powerful would be considerably dangerous if recalibrated to damage human technology. Imagine what the NMLA could have done with such a device.

 JS: Terrible things, no doubt. But your fleet in Didio could be seen as a tacit endorsement of Salvation by Allied leadership, regardless of your personal views.

RZ: As I said, Salvation's results are highly impressive.

JS: Let's hope they remain so. We'll take a short break. Join us after these messages.

The rest of this interview is available to pilots arriving at the megaship Salote Charm in the Didio system.


* Thargoid Warpath May Threaten Marlinists
Voices in the Senate have argued that the Marlinist Colonies should have become an Imperial protectorate to shield them against the Thargoids.

Senator Arturo Durant was quoted by The Imperial Herald:

« The region containing the Marlinist Colonies sits relatively close to what is commonly regarded as Thargoid territory. A strike by the aliens would rapidly overwhelm the paltry security forces of a handful of under-developed systems. »

« Naturally we respect Her Majesty's decision to acknowledge their autonomy, but many feel that the Marlinists may regret the decision to sit outside our protective sphere. After all, these were once Imperial citizens. It's our duty to defend them, whether or not they grant us permission. »

First Minister Octavia Volkov published a response via The Marlin Standard:

« The proximity of the Thargoids is an ever-present concern, and it's true that we do lack a dedicated navy. But many authorised militias such as the Dark Wolf Marlinists have fought courageously to defend our people, and will do so again should the Thargoids turn their attention our way. »

« I remind the senator that we have not only retained control of the original colonies, but also expanded into over two dozen neighbouring systems. Marlin Duval's dream of forming an interstellar republic is finally flourishing, after centuries of being repressed within the Empire. »


* An Interview with Zachary Rackham
Sol Today hosted an interview with the multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham, who is rumoured to be moving into politics.

From his villa at Lake Rackham, overlooking Homeland's famous Singing Geysers, the entrepreneur spoke at length on various topics.

On the rise of his business empire:

« The hard-working folk at Rackham Capital Investments have done me proud in recent years. We're currently holding financial talks to acquire a major starport company, so watch this space! »

On his role with the Beta Hydri Corporation:

« It's a privilege to support my people in Beta Hydri, by helping to run their government. Things are already running smoother after I streamlined a few departments. »

On suggestions that he will take part in the Federal presidential election:

« I'm deeply flattered by calls to stand as an independent candidate. But really, an ordinary guy like me as president? I suppose it indicates that people are looking for something different to what Hudson and Winters offer. »

On Bryanna Blanco's claims that he was once a pirate:

« Ah, you have to admire Ms Blanco's tenacity! But 'Calico Zack' sounds like a character from an Olav Redcourt novel, doesn't he? I should thank her for making me look a lot more impressive than I ever was. »


* Allied System Receives Vital Resources
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has helped provide commodities to sustain the Didio system during the ongoing Thargoid assault.

Pilots transported multiple shipments of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food cartridges to the megaship Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system. These were then redirected to Didio and distributed wherever they were most urgently needed.

The campaign was orchestrated by Admiral Nikolas Glass, who announced:

« By replenishing key supplies during this time of great crisis, Sirius Corporation has again shown its dedication to the Alliance's military efforts. This will undoubtedly pave the way for the strategic defence pact to be accepted by the Assembly once the trial period has completed. »

Sirius Corporation has confirmed that all pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect payment from Chariot of Rhea in Leesti.

In related news, the superpowers are continuing to reward independent ships for destroying Thargoid vessels in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems. Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons are expected to be operational one week from today.


* Thargoid Research Project Requires Meta-Alloys
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Commanders have been asked to collect meta-alloys from Thargoid barnacles as part of a wider xenological study.

The research project is being orchestrated by Professor Ishmael Palin, one of the most prominent experts in Thargoid technology:

« With escalating Thargoid activity in the core systems, it is increasingly important that we learn as much as possible about this species. Only through scientific study can we better comprehend their biomechanical nature and, where possible, enhance our defences against it. »

« The initial phase requires fresh samples of meta-alloys, the unique material used in the construction of Thargoid vessels. These can be harvested from barnacles that the Thargoids have seeded on selected planets. »

Pilots can deliver meta-alloys to the starport James Sneddon in the Morten-Marte system. As part of the Federal Reclamation Co's support for this initiative, the station's market also offers an increased price for any Thargoid tissue samples.

In addition to credit payments for all those delivering meta-alloys, class 4A, 5A and 6A corrosion resistant cargo racks will be available to selected contributors. The 5A and 6A versions have been exclusively manufactured for this project, and are not commercially available at present.

Professor Palin stated that possessing these cargo racks will be of great benefit in the project's planned second phase, scheduled to occur in the next few weeks.


* Marlinist Colonies Gain Starports
Two new starports have been added to Marlinist systems, following a successful delivery initiative last month.

The use of pre-built infrastructures and mass-produced components has allowed the orbital stations to be assembled rapidly. The starport names and locations are Fairfax Legacy in the Hyades Sector SU-C a14-1 system, and Ackwada Monument in the Hyades Sector LX-T c3-30 system.

The Marlinist Parliament welcomed the new starports, stating that they « will lay strong foundations for increased commerce with the interstellar community ».

As a result of a recent diplomatic arrangement, two million Marlinist refugees have been offered transport from the Alliance to the colony systems. They are being processed and granted citizenship at the new starports.

A campaign to rename the two existing starports, Stillman Hub and Tilman Point, was discouraged by Sirius Corporation. These stations were constructed when the megacorp first established the colonies in 3306, as a way to defuse tensions between the Empire and the Federation.

However, Sirius Corporation did not object to new designations for the original eight Marlinist systems. These are expected to become official in the coming weeks.


* Rackham Achieves Trillionaire Status
The personal fortune of entrepreneur Zachary Rackham has now surpassed one trillion credits, due to a new corporate acquisition.

A report in The Tau Ceti Journal highlighted the achievement:

« Rackham Capital Investments now officially owns the company Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, which constructs Orbis starports. The business deal had been in the pipeline for years with little sign of progress, but was unexpectedly agreed by both parties in the last few days. »

« Susannah Haynes, CEO of the now-renamed Rackham Spaceframes, welcomed the arrangement. She remarked that 'improved financial stability can only benefit our efficiency at manufacturing orbital habitats'. »

« Analysts estimate that the total value of Mr Rackham's estate is now approximately 1,012,000,000,000 credits. This makes him one of a handful of private citizens in the Federation who can claim to be trillionaires. »

The Federal Times featured a response from the journalist Bryanna Blanco:

« I cannot question the legality of the Kavanagh Spaceframes purchase. But the timing is suspicious, following Rackham's recent self-hype about running for president. Whatever he did to push this deal through, the publicity will be worth it. Political supporters and corporate investors will surely flock to his side now that he has become the Federal equivalent of royalty. »


* Archon Delaine Faces Pirate Rebellion
A power struggle is raging within the Kumo Crew following a coordinated effort to overthrow the syndicate's leader, Archon Delaine.

The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed delivered this exclusive report:

« What at first seemed to be merely another attempt to assassinate Delaine turned out to be a far greater threat. Simultaneous attacks across the organisation revealed that this was actually the first strike in a full-blown coup. »

« The rebellion is being led by Arch-Corsair Vidar Trask, a senior member of the Kumo Council. He has declared that the syndicate is stagnating under Delaine's 'tired brand of barbarism', and that new leadership will bring greater glories and riches. »

« Fierce combat has ignited in the Kumo Crew's key areas as both sides battle for resources. Trask's loyalists are being aided by a motley collection of pirate gangs as well as thousands of unidentified fighters, suggesting that he has hired mercenaries to bolster his forces. »

« Archon Delaine, whose guards barely managed to shield him from the assassins, has ordered that the insurrection must be stamped out at any cost. He also vowed an explicitly violent revenge upon Vidar Trask, who has been one of his closest aides for many years. »


* Salvation Triggers Superweapon Victory
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The invading Thargoid forces in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems have been completely repelled by Salvation.

Vox Galactica journalist Jade Sanderlyn published this account:

« We've received confirmation from Commodore Morag Halloran that three anti-xeno superweapons were activated in Didio, Novas and Sosong. This caused the Thargoid fleets in all three systems to immediately withdraw into hyperspace. »

« It seems that the Thargoids have no defence against the Guardian-derived superweapon, which generates an electromagnetic pulse to disrupt their biomechanical technology. »

« Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces have been keeping the Thargoids at bay for the last two weeks. Admirals Ziegler, Price and Atherton sent messages of congratulation to Salvation, who seems set to receive additional resources to improve superweapon production. For better or worse, it appears Salvation now plays a crucial role in humanity's war against the Thargoids. »

The superpowers also offered rewards to independent pilots for contributing to the systems' defences. Commanders can redeem Thargoid combat bonds at Plymouth Howl in the Ch'anjie system, Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system, and Sturckow Orbital in the Lesheima system.


* Thargoid Research Project Phase One Completed
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Professor Ishmael Palin has received multiple shipments of Thargoid meta-alloys for xenological study.

From Abel Laboratory, his workshop in the Arque system, Professor Palin made the following announcement:

« I am deeply grateful to all those who collected meta-alloys from barnacle sites. Analysing these samples will help us learn more about the biomechanical technology currently employed by the Thargoid fleets. »

« I am planning the second phase of this project, which has the combined assistance of the Alliance, Empire and Federation. Despite the horror of the recent attacks, we must seize every chance to increase our scientific knowledge. »

Professor Palin has authorised payment for all pilots who took part in the initiative. This includes awarding class 4A, 5A and 6A corrosion resistant cargo racks to those who made the greatest contributions.

The rewards can be collected at the starport James Sneddon in the Morten-Marte system. In addition, the Federal Reclamation Co will continue to offer high prices for Thargoid tissue samples sold via the station's market.


* Supply Rare Goods for Rackham Celebration
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The entrepreneur Zachary Rackham has asked for deliveries of rare items to Edmondson High in the Beta Hydri system.

At a press conference on the planet Homeland, Mr Rackham announced:

« It's not every day that a humble businessman like me celebrates becoming a trillionaire! So I'm holding a week-long party in the upper floors of Rackham's Spire. To make sure my guests are entertained, I'll need to keep my stocks of Apa Vietii from Upaniklis, Gerasian Gueuze Beer from Geras, Pantaa Prayer Sticks from George Pantazis, Uszaian Tree Grubs from Uszaa and Anduliga Fire Works from Anduliga high throughout the entire week. »

« I've also arranged for pilots to receive temporary permits to the Beta Hydri system, which will last until the 2nd of June. Anything to make life easier for my trader friends! »

Mr Rackham faced criticism for hosting a celebration at a time when so many have died in recent Thargoid attacks. In response, he claimed he had « a duty to boost public morale by filling the news with happier stories ».

Financial reporter Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:

« The guest list for this party includes politicians, media magnates, publicity gurus, and many others who would prove useful if you were running a presidential campaign. Should Rackham get enough of them on his side \u2013 presumably by sparing no expense on their comfort and entertainment \u2013 I think he'll officially set his sights on the Federation's top job. »


* Dredger Clan Visits the Golconda
The Artificers Clan dredger has entered the Upaniklis system, where the generation ship Golconda currently resides.

The Golconda, when it was discovered in 3305, was still inhabited with the descendants of its original crew who left Sol in the 22nd century. They accepted the Federation's help to abandon the ancient generation ship and resettle on the Forester's Choice outpost, where their unique culture would remain undisturbed.

The Artificers Clan is a nomadic community living aboard a Dredger-class bulk cruiser, an old design that refuels by scooping raw materials and salvage. Little is known about this particular tribe, which rarely enters inhabited systems.

The dredger's arrival was initially reported by independent pilots. Commander Javi Alvarado  gave a statement to Vox Galactica:

« I regularly make trade runs to Forester's Choice. I've made a few friends there, but the Golcondans are still very cautious with outsiders. This rush to bulk-buy their Apa Vietii for Rackham's party has caught them by surprise! »

« Anyway, when the Artificers first appeared, the Golcondans asked me to find out what they wanted. I flew out to the dredger, but most of my hails got no reply. Only once did I get a burst of some rapid, densely verbose language. From what I could make out, they seem to be interested in the Golconda itself, but they didn't explain further. »


* Pirate Rebels Coup Attempt Fails
An insurrection led by Arch-Corsair Vidar Trask has failed to gain control of the Kumo Crew syndicate.

Vox Galactica featured a report by freelance correspondent Karleen Troy:

« As might be expected, it's hard to obtain official data when conflict breaks out within a criminal organisation. But all the information I've gathered points to the same conclusion: Vidar Trask's coup attempt has failed. »

« What is surprising, however, is how close he initially came to dethroning Archon Delaine. The Kumo Crew were almost overwhelmed by the sheer number of fighters following Trask's banner. I'm told that nearly half of the rebelling forces have yet to be identified, and are suspected to be mercenaries. »

« A second mystery is that Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, another senior member of the Kumo Council, has been declared missing. The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed believes that she was killed by Trask personally. The newest inner circle member, Callan Salamanca, is leading Delaine's counter-attack against the insurrectionists. »

« Most of the surviving rebels have now retreated to HIP 10792 and are attempting to drive out the Kumo Council faction in that system. Eyewitness reports regarding the ongoing firefights suggest that Delaine is in no mood to forgive his would-be usurpers. »


* Rackham's Lavish Celebration Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A party held by newly confirmed trillionaire Zachary Rackham has concluded, with attendees claiming it was an 'incredible' event.

The week-long event took place in the upper storeys of the Rackham's Spire building on the planet Homeland. This required regular supplies of the luxury items Apa Vietii, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Pantaa Prayer Sticks, Uszaian Tree Grubs and Anduliga Fire Works.

A spokesperson for Rackham Capital Investments thanked pilots for these deliveries, and confirmed that payment could be collected at Edmondson High in the Beta Hydri system. The spokesperson remarked that Mr Rackham himself was unable to make a personal appearance due to 'fatigue'.

The Federal Times published this piece by financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:

« First-hand accounts from some of the partygoers suggest this was more like a no-expense-spared holiday. Each attendee was assigned an Achilles Corporation PA-961 serving robot as a personal butler, constantly attending to their every whim. An impressive range of beverages, cuisine and various legal stimulants were available. Those who wished to stay overnight were provided with luxurious suites near the peak of Rackham's Spire, offering fantastic views of the picturesque landscape. »

« There were exclusive live shows from top performers, including steeldub band Gr@wl!x and popular singer Caspar Karma. Exotic entertainers from the Lucinda Ninespice Agency provided both public and private entertainment. And everyone departed with a goodie bag containing limited edition Duradrives, colonies of Altairian Skin, and gambling credit chips for the new Rackham's Casino down below in Los Pioneros. »

« The guestlist included PR specialist Anya Blackriver, Sol Today's owner Neive McFarlane, Beta Hydri Corporation's entire board of directors, senior management from half a dozen Federal banks, and no less than eight independent, Liberal and Republican congressmen. »

« How many of these tried to convince Rackham that running for president was a mistake, and how many offered their support in hopes of future rewards? I'm sure the old pirate will pursue whichever route offers the greatest opportunity for new treasure. »


* Archon Delaine Seeks to Destroy Pirate Rebels
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has engaged in open warfare on the pirate insurrectionists gathered in the HIP 10792 system.

A recent coup attempt led by Arch-Corsair Vidar Trask, formerly one of the senior members of the Kumo Council, has failed. His forces were unable to eliminate Delaine and take control of the criminal organisation.

The rebels' vessels have concentrated in HIP 10792. Trask is commanding a coalition of loyalists, independent pirate gangs and as-yet unidentified mercenaries, collectively calling themselves the Trask Death Corsairs.

Despite suffering from some visible wounds as a result of the assassination attempt, Archon Delaine broadcast this message:

« Trask has betrayed all of us, and for that I want him crushed! I will pay well to wipe out every single traitor who fights in his name. »

The Kumo Council faction will reward all independent pilots supporting its operation against the Trask Death Corsairs in the HIP 10792 system, which is being orchestrated from Crimson Exchange.


* Mystery in Upaniklis
A dredger clan is continuing to examine the abandoned generation ship Golconda in the Upaniklis system.

The Golconda was placed in orbit around Upaniklis B 3 in 3305 when its inhabitants migrated to the nearby outpost Forester's Choice. Over the past week there have been reports of smaller craft travelling between the Artificers Clan dredger and the Golconda, but the nomadic tribe has not responded to attempts to communicate.

Commander Javi Alvarado, a regular visitor to the system, submitted his observations to Vox Galactica:

« I was convinced that these scavengers were breaking down the Golconda into scrap to feed to their dredger. Or maybe taking over the whole ship to use as a new home. But I haven't seen any signs of structural damage yet, and it doesn't look like the Artificers have accessed its habitation areas either. So what are they up to? »

« Things are a little weird in Forester's Choice right now. It doesn't seem anywhere near as busy, and many concourse vendors have closed down. There's almost a kind of religious hush. For centuries their entire existence relied upon the Golconda, and its presence nearby was reassuring. I think seeing outsiders interfere with it has affected them deeply. »

The Federal Diplomatic Corp published an official reminder that Forester's Choice has partner status with the Federation, adding: « As a micro-society that evolved in isolation, the Golcondan people are legally protected against cultural contamination. We will continue to monitor the Artificer Clan's activity in the Upaniklis system. »


* Salvation: 'War's End Within Reach'
The anonymous scientist Salvation has made a statement following his latest success against the Thargoids.

The message was broadcast across all public channels:

« This is Salvation. The deployment of my anti-xeno superweapons in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems was highly effective, just as I anticipated. Billions of lives were undoubtedly saved as a result. »

« Due to support from the Alliance, Empire and Federation, we have made a major breakthrough in utilising Guardian-based technology. Construction of the next generation of superweapons has already begun. These will allow us to deliver a truly overwhelming strike against the Thargoid species. »

« The end of the war is finally within reach. Those who hold faith in my work will be vindicated, and humanity can at last close the chapter on this existential threat. »

Commodore Morag Halloran confirmed that Taurus Mining Ventures, Salvation's partner organisation, had received a boost in resources from all three superpowers. This included seconded naval personnel, megaship supplies and advanced engineering equipment.

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have stated they are now fully committed to working with Salvation on anti-xeno operations. Representatives from the Assembly, Congress and Senate expressed confidence that there would soon be decisive developments in the conflict with the Thargoids.


* Piratical Dredger Clan Departs
The Blue Viper Club dredger clan has unexpectedly severed ties with the Kumo Crew, which is currently battling an attempted rebellion.

No explanations or itinerary were provided when the nomadic tribe's dredger jumped from the Pegasi Sector PN-T c3-14 system to an unknown destination.

The Blue Viper Club formed a partnership with the Kumo Crew syndicate in July 3307, when it provided a new narcotic crop that later became known as onionhead gamma strain.

The Pegasi Sentinel published the following exclusive:

« We have obtained proof that Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne is still alive, despite rumours that she had been murdered by Vidar Trask. Our undercover reporter recorded Volantyne and her personal retinue boarding a shuttle at Kumo City starport, which docked with the Blue Viper Club's dredger a few hours before its departure. »

« Volantyne was born on that vessel, and acted as the primary liaison between the spacefaring clan and the Kumo Crew. It seems that she has now abandoned her position to rejoin her people, instead of taking part in the fight against Trask's followers. »

« This raises a disturbing question: were Trask and Volantyne working together to depose Archon Delaine? Last October they both attended a secret event held by the Jokers' Deck gambling circle, famed for permitting stakes reaching billions of credits. Did their winnings provide the financial backing for a joint coup? »


* Kumo Crew Crushes Rebellion
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Forces involved in an attempted coup on Archon Delaine's syndicate have been soundly defeated in the HIP 10792 system.

Vidar Trask, formerly an arch-corsair in the Kumo Crew syndicate, was declared dead when his private vessel was destroyed during the conflict. The few surviving ships in the Trask Death Corsairs have now abandoned his cause.

Reports from The Pegasi Sentinel and Vox Galactica newsfeeds have shed more light on the insurrection. Over the past few years, Trask secretly gathered followers while acting as Archon Delaine's trusted advisor. Funded by successful gambling at Jokers' Deck events, he bought the loyalty of many independent criminal groups to bolster his forces.

It has also been revealed that Trask's previously unidentified mercenaries were members of the Blue Viper Club dredger clan. This suggests that his partner in the coup attempt was indeed Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, who originally hailed from the nomadic tribe. She was last seen returning to the dredger before it jumped to an unknown destination.

Archon Delaine, who is still recovering from last week's assassination attempt, proclaimed:

« I will hunt down and slaughter every single one of Volantyne's treacherous clan for their betrayal of my trust. That rusting hulk will find no refuge in this galaxy! »

Pilots who supported the Kumo Council faction can now collect rewards from Crimson Exchange in HIP 10792.


* Derelict Generation Ship Undergoes Repairs
The Artificers Clan has begun to retrofit the generation ship Golconda into a fully operational modern vessel.

Jonathon Forester, former captain of the vacated 22nd-century craft, provided a statement to Vox Galactica:

« When the dredger clan first arrived in the Upaniklis system, we feared they had come to salvage the Golconda. Instead, to our surprise, they've initiated engineering work on it: reinforcing the ship's structural integrity, repairing damaged components, and installing modern engines and navigational systems. Yet the decks where our community previously lived remains untouched. »

« The Artificers didn't request permission to do this, which upset many of us. But today we received a message expressing a strange, child-like excitement at finding what they called a 'dead-hulk', and their determination to 'revive' it for us. With their incredible skills, it's possible that the Golconda could become spaceworthy again within weeks. »

« This has prompted a huge debate among my people. Should we return to our old home? Some have grown accustomed to the benefits of living at this outpost. Others believe we should resume journeying between the stars, as our ancestors did for centuries. »

« Many are looking to me for leadership, and I must admit to finding such a decision hard. I thought the Golconda was our history, but perhaps it still holds our future. »


* Rackham Announces Presidential Candidacy
The trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham has officially confirmed that he will stand as a candidate in the 3309 Federal election.

Mr Rackham finally stated his intentions following several weeks of speculation. At a press conference, he said:

« I know what you're all thinking. That guy as president? Isn't he just a common businessman, who used to survive on scraps by trading trinkets in a rusty old Sidewinder? »

« But despite my humble origins, many good people have convinced me that my experience with running corporations would prove useful to the Federation. I feel like everyone's tired of the same empty words from the two big political parties. It's time to hear from the little guy! »

Mr Rackham added that it will take several weeks to prepare his manifesto and campaign team. It is unknown whether he intends to form a new political party or stand as an independent candidate.

There has been no comment from President Hudson or Shadow President Winters. However, several congressmen remarked that the media attention accompanying Mr Rackham's efforts might attract more public interest in next year's presidential race. Only 65% of eligible voters took part in the last election in 3300.

The Tau Ceti Journal noted that the value of shares in Rackham Capital Investments has soared to an all-time high, making many investors extremely wealthy overnight.


* New Discovery Links Azimuth to INRA
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

An abandoned outpost in the DG Canum Venaticorum system could reveal the true identity of the anonymous figure Salvation.

Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, made a public announcement:

« An untraceable source pointed me to the DG Canum Venaticorum system with the question: Who is Salvation? A unique detail caught my attention, so I requested verification from pilots who had supported Aegis. We found a previously undiscovered research outpost once controlled by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm. »

« The site contains logs which directly connect Azimuth Biochemicals to INRA's development of the mycoid virus. As is now known, this bioweapon was used covertly against the Thargoids and drove them away from human space for decades. »

« Most significantly, I believe these logs may finally reveal Salvation's real name and background. I urge the superpowers to halt their collaboration with Salvation while this new data is verified. »

INRA was a clandestine anti-xeno organisation formed in 3125 by the Empire and Federation. Although its mycoid bioweapon contributed hugely to the end of the first Thargoid war in 3151, INRA's activities have since been denounced by the superpowers as illegal and unethical.

Azimuth Biochemicals was a pharmaceutical corporation secretly involved in xenological research and weapons development. Aegis has warned that Azimuth may still be active in some form, as suggested by the Project Seraph logs in HIP 22460.

Neither Salvation nor his partners at Taurus Mining Ventures have yet responded to Professor Tesreau's claims.


* The Golconda Resurrection
With the generation ship Golconda being repaired by the Artificers Clan, its former population are considering resuming their journey.

Commander Javi Alvarado, a local trader who befriended the Golcondans, offered this insight for Vox Galactica:

« Following a prompt from the Artificers Clan, I transported Captain Forester and other community leaders from Forester's Choice to the Golconda. They were visibly awed at the changes made to their ancient home, with modern interface panels and machinery expertly entwined with thousand-year-old technology. »

« The newly installed frame shift drive was powered up, which brought Forester close to tears. We also visited the habitation rings, now sustained by updated environmental systems but otherwise unchanged. »

« There were Artificers Clan members bustling back and forth. Each wore grime-stained overalls, criss-crossed with belts and bandoliers dangling with tools, and diagnostic scanners of some kind covering their eyes. They chattered to each other in a rapid dialect that was hard to follow, as they performed engineering work on whatever they could lay their hands on. »

« The chieftain explained to Captain Forester that the clan retrofitted the Golconda mainly because 'tech-love' was their 'life-duty'. But the clan also asked for supplies of fresh food for their dredger, which Forester agreed to provide. »

« As we flew back to the outpost, I could tell that most of the Golcondans were deeply affected. I can't blame them \u2013 the only world many of them knew for decades has been transformed. The leaders spoke of an unexpected opportunity to resume their old way of life, and questioned whether a stationary existence honours their ancestors' dream. I get the feeling that change is in the wind. »


* The Plot to Depose Archon Delaine
Further information has emerged regarding Vidar Trask's failed attempt to take control of the Kumo Crew syndicate.

The latest findings were reported by The Pegasi Sentinel:

« The few survivors from Trask's shattered army have revealed that over a thousand fighters were supplied by the Blue Viper Club dredger clan. Kay Volantyne, one of its leaders, is now confirmed to have masterminded the coup alongside Trask. »

« Their motivations were as different as their backgrounds. Trask rose to power beside Archon Delaine but became frustrated under his rule, believing that he could reorganise the Kumo Crew along more efficient lines. Volantyne aimed to provide her nomadic tribe with permanent homes, to be financed by trafficking onionhead gamma strain and protected by the syndicate's might. »

« We have also learned that the standard of living on the Blue Viper Club dredger has markedly improved in recent months. This was in accordance with the terms of the alliance that Volantyne brokered between the clan and the Kumo Crew. »

« According to engineers at Kumo City starport, the dredger's modernised hyperdrive enables it to make jumps more frequently and over greater distances. This means it could now be almost anywhere within a several hundred light year radius, which may frustrate Delaine's vow to hunt down Volantyne and exact revenge for her betrayal. »


* Relaunching the Golconda
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Traders and combat pilots are required in the Upaniklis system to assist the Golconda in resuming its voyage.

The ancient generation ship, which originated from Earth in the 22nd century, has been retrofitted by the Artificers Clan into a functional modern vessel. The majority of its former population have decided to leave the outpost Forester's Choice and return to their traditional nomadic lifestyle.

Captain Jonathon Forester, leader of the Golconda Union, announced:

« In 3305 the galactic community provided us with the chance to end our original journey, so it will be fitting if they can help us start a new chapter among the stars. The Golconda now has a frame shift drive that requires tritium fuel, and shipments of medical diagnostic equipment and power generators are also needed. »

Upaniklis Vision Incorporated has agreed to organise the initiative. Pilots are asked to deliver all commodities to Fozard Port, from where they will be transferred aboard the Golconda.

Local security forces warned that pirates may attempt to hijack incoming shipments or take control of the Golconda itself. As a defensive measure, Upaniklis Vision Incorporated has offered bounties on all wanted ships in the system.

According to the Federal Diplomatic Corp, these events do not violate the legislation that protects isolated societies from cultural contamination. It added: « Partnership status with the Federation has been extended to the Golconda and continues to apply to Forester's Choice outpost. »


* Aegis: 'Arrest Salvation for Murder'
Claims that Salvation was once a senior member of Azimuth Biochemicals who worked for INRA have led to a public outcry.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling reported on these developments for Vox Galactica:

« Information recently uncovered in the DG Canum Venaticorum system has been presented by Professor Alba Tesreau. It suggests that Salvation's real name is Dr Caleb Wycherley, former vice-president of research at Azimuth Biochemicals. According to Wycherley's personal logs, his team contributed to the development of the controversial mycoid bioweapon deployed by INRA during the First Thargoid War. »

« Wycherley's logs also provide evidence that he gained the nickname of 'The Witch'. This figure has been implicated in the murderous attack on the Alexandria megaship in June 3307 and in Project Seraph recordings found in the HIP 26176 and HIP 22460 systems. »

« Former Aegis leadership has demanded that Salvation be arrested and questioned over his involvement in these events, and that superpower fleet support for Salvation's work be suspended until such questions have been answered. »

Supporters of Salvation have dismissed the latest logs as fake, pointing out that Dr Wycherley would now be over 200 years old and that the mention of 'salvation' is coincidental. But outrage remains high over the unethical activities of both Azimuth and INRA, and Salvation's growing influence over anti-Thargoid operations has been cast in a new light.

« The Alliance, Empire and Federation have all responded with noncommittal statements that the accusation will be investigated, » said Sterling. « However, since Salvation's unique superweapons now form the cornerstone of their anti-xeno strategy, his arrest would be a major political and military inconvenience. »


* Alliance-Sirius Pact Enters Approval Stage
The probationary period for the proposed anti-xeno partnership between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation has now ended.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made this public statement:

« Documentation for the strategic defence pact has been submitted to the Assembly for debate and amendment. Council members will vote by the end of June to decide whether or not it should be ratified. »

« In the last three months, Sirius Corporation has successfully increased security for Allied interests in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas. It also did a splendid job arranging for crucial supplies to be delivered to the Didio system during the Thargoid invasion. »

« The Council of Admirals does not wish to rely exclusively on Salvation to protect Allied systems, and I concur with their assessment. Combining our defence force with Sirius's resources will be a huge step toward forming an Alliance Navy, thereby increasing our anti-Thargoid fleet capabilities on a par with the Empire and Federation. »

Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon's political rival, also made a statement:

« In my view, Sirius Corporation remains an untrustworthy partner and has exerted a disruptive influence on the Alliance. I continue to oppose the strategic defence pact, and urge my fellow council members to prevent it being adopted as policy. »


* Thargoid Research Project Phase Two Begins
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Professor Ishmael Palin has requested deliveries of Thargoid artefacts to the Arque system for scientific study.

The first phase of the project took place last month and focused on meta-alloys. In a public announcement, Professor Palin outlined the second phase:

« My ongoing analysis of the Thargoids' biomechanical technology has reached a point where fresh material is needed. Specifically, I require large supplies of Thargoid probes, resin and sensors. »

« I appreciate that there are risks involved in transporting such dangerous alien artefacts. Hopefully, the corrosion resistant cargo racks that were provided following this project's initial phase will prove useful. »

« As well as payment in credits, I am pleased to offer Grade 5 engineered Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Packages as an additional reward. »

Pilots are asked to deliver Thargoid probes, Thargoid resin and Thargoid sensors to Baird Gateway on the planet Arque 4 E.


* Golconda Receives Vital Supplies
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Shipments delivered to the Upaniklis system have enabled the Golconda generation ship to resume its millennia-long voyage.

Tritium, medical diagnostic equipment and power generators were needed to finalise the retrofit of the ancient vessel. Bounties were placed on all wanted ships in the system to protect traders from pirates targeting the flow of traffic to the Golconda.

A statement was provided by Captain Jonathon Forester:

« The Golconda has now achieved full operational status, and for the first time is capable of faster than light travel. I offer my deepest gratitude to all those who made this possible. It will be my honour to once again lead my people on our journey among the stars. »

The majority of the original population have begun to migrate back to the generation ship, which nurtured their isolated micro-civilisation for over a millennium. A few thousand Golcondans have elected to remain at Forester's Choice outpost, under the guidance of the ship's former custodian Erin Grey.

Itsuko Harada, CEO of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated, announced:

« When the Golconda first arrived in our space, we were pleased to play a part in rescuing its people. I am likewise overjoyed that we could aid its historic rebirth. Rewards for all pilots who made deliveries, and those who defended them against criminals, are now available at Fozard Port. »

The Golconda's transformation was achieved thanks to the advanced engineering skills of the Artificers Clan, who performed repairs and updates at great speed. The clan's dredger has now left the Upaniklis system, having been provided fresh food supplies by the Golconda Union.


* Project Seraph Victim Seeks Revenge
The location of an INRA base in the DG Canum Venaticorum system was revealed by a survivor of the notorious Project Seraph.

Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, initially received the tip-off from an anonymous source but has now provided clarification:

« Further communication with my source has revealed that she was once a 'candidate' of Project Seraph, a now-abandoned operation run by Azimuth Biochemicals several years ago. At the Oaken Point facility in the HIP 26176 system, scientists attempted to directly interface with Thargoid scout vessels by grafting neural and physiological implants into living subjects. »

« Most of these horrific experiments ended in failure or death, but the subject classified as D-2 escaped from Oaken Point by stowing away on a trader's ship. Since then she has used her inside knowledge to investigate Azimuth, confirming Aegis's belief that the corporation is still active. »

« D-2 asked me to make the following message public: 'Tell the Witch that I remember everything. I want him to know that the truth came from me.' »

The INRA base's logs suggest that Salvation's real name is Dr Caleb Wycherley, Azimuth Biochemicals's vice-president of research at the time of recording. If D-2's accusation is true, it would mean that Wycherley has survived for over two centuries and was conducting unauthorised xenological experiments under the pseudonym 'The Witch'.

Many supporters of Salvation believe that the Project Seraph logs were fabricated by Aegis to undermine their rival's anti-xeno operations. Neither Salvation nor his partners, Taurus Mining Ventures, have yet made an official statement.


* Alliance Divided over Anti-Xeno Pact
The proposed strategic defence partnership with Sirius Corporation is being hotly debated within the Alliance Assembly.

Vanya Driscoll, political journalist with The Alliance Tribune, reported on the situation:

« Sirius Corporation's offer to provide support against the Thargoids has caused considerable disruption this year. There was a conflict and push for independence in the Reorte system, with a Sirius Navy representative joining the Council of Admirals. »

« A three-month trial period ended with some achievements, including an increased military presence in the Coalsack and Witch Head colonies and logistical support of the recent Alliance Defence Force deployment to Didio. But it seems not enough was done to sway the majority of opponents. »

« Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is gambling that he has earned enough political capital to have the strategic defence pact ratified. Many government figures welcome the prospect of increased military strength. Mahon's suggestion that this might result in an expanded Alliance was especially compelling. »

« Councillor Nakato Kaine is taking the opposite view, successfully tapping into widespread concerns over Sirius Corporation's motives. She argues that the megacorp has not proven capable of defending Allied systems against Thargoid attack, despite the terms of the trial period preventing Sirius from deploying its fleet to active Allied engagements. »

« Council members are flocking to support either Mahon or Kaine, although dozens remain undecided. It's clear that both sides will soon strive to sway public opinion, in order to influence the Assembly's deciding vote at the end of this month. »


* Salvation and the Superpowers
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have responded coolly to accusations that Salvation has hidden links to Azimuth Biochemicals and INRA.

Vox Galactica published a report from political correspondent Conrad Sterling:

« Salvation has always been a contentious figure, and the logs found in the DG Canum Venaticorum system have polarised public opinion further. Some are enraged that Salvation may have history with INRA or be responsible for the loss of the Alexandria. Others believe Aegis's claims to be false, a desperate attempt to save themselves. But how have the superpowers reacted? »

« The Empire is taking a pragmatic view, with Senator Denton Patreus focusing on the strategic objective of defeating the Thargoids. As he bluntly told the Senate: 'Nothing in the Imperial armoury comes close to matching the anti-xeno superweapon's devastating capabilities.' »

« In the Federation, Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori has revived his investigation into Salvation and is hoping to authenticate the INRA logs. But other Federal leaders have adopted a 'wait and see' approach, refusing to be drawn on the controversy. »

« A broader range of reactions can be heard from the Alliance, albeit with little change in policy. Admiral Rachel Ziegler acknowledged that the accusations must be taken seriously, but added: 'With the Sirius Corporation defence pact still under debate, and the Alliance lacking a proper naval force, we must continue to utilise all military options available to us.' »


* Alliance-Sirius Military Pact to be Decided
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Di Jian system is hosting competing campaigns as the Alliance Assembly votes on the strategic defence pact.

The Assembly is evenly split over formalising military ties with Sirius Corporation to enhance defensive options against the Thargoids, with a decision expected at the end of June. In advance of the vote, both pro-pact and anti-Sirius councillors are attempting to sway colleagues to their cause by securing a sizeable resource package for the Alliance Defence Force.

Pro-pact councillors have established their initiative in Di Jian from the Sirius megaship Kumiho Sky, and are asking for shipments of computer components, reinforced mounting plates and synthetic reagents. These councillors have heavily promoted the need for enhanced fleet support in the face of increasing Thargoid activity. Noted engineer Marco Qwent recently confirmed his support for an Allied anti-xeno pact with Sirius.

The anti-Sirius lobby has requested deliveries of the same commodities to Preuss Terminal in the Di Jian system. The system's controlling faction, Sol's Salutis Aeternum, is overseeing contributions. Engineers Uma Laszlo and Bill Turner have both expressed a hope that the anti-xeno pact with Sirius is denied.

To encourage support from pilots, each campaign is offering extra incentives. The majority of contributors to the Kumiho Sky campaign will receive a pre-engineered high capacity AX fixed missile launcher, among other rewards, courtesy of Sirius Corporation.

Sol's Salutis Aeternum is instead offering a stock Alliance Chieftain to a limited number of Preuss Terminal campaign contributors. Other rewards are available for contributors outside this number.


* Xenological Project Receives Thargoid Artefacts
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A range of alien objects have been delivered to the Arque system for Professor Ishmael Palin's study of the Thargoids.

The conclusion of the project was announced by Professor Palin:

« I am highly impressed with the number of Thargoid probes, resin and sensors that were delivered to Abel Laboratory. Collecting and transporting these items can be a hazardous task, so I deeply appreciate the effort made by pilots to obtain them. »

« It is becoming increasingly urgent to improve our understanding of the Thargoids' biomechanical technology. There is no sign that hostilities are about to end, so the need to produce defences has become paramount. Only through ensuring our research focuses on up-to-date samples can we be sure that we are working as efficiently as possible. »

Contributors can now collect their rewards from Baird Gateway in the Arque system. This includes Grade 5 engineered Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Packages for eligible contributors.


* A Renewed Journey for the Golconda
The generation ship Golconda has departed from the Upaniklis system with much of its former population on board.

Three years ago, the Golcondans abandoned their ship and resettled at the Forester's Choice outpost in Upaniklis. Approximately 60% of these 70,000 people have now elected to resume their itinerant lifestyle aboard the vessel, which was recently upgraded with modern megaship technology by the Artificers Clan.

The Federation has made assurances that the Golconda is under its protection, and is equipped with comms systems to summon aid if needed. The Forester's Choice outpost remains operational and will continue to export Apa Vietti, a unique alcoholic spirit.

Shortly before the Golconda made its first jump into hyperspace, Vox Galactica published a statement from Commander Javi Alvarado:

« The last few weeks have been a bittersweet experience for me, watching these people prepare to return to their old home. My plan was to keep making trade runs to the outpost, but when Captain Forester asked me to join them on their voyage, I agreed without hesitation. It's hardwired into Golcondan culture to distrust outsiders, so I know what a rare honour this invitation is. »

« The Golconda can now leap rather than crawl between the stars, and the whole galaxy is its horizon. For the first time in my piloting career, I have no idea what my destination is. But at least I'll be travelling in the company of born explorers. »


* Azimuth Resurgent
Salvation has announced that his partner organisation Taurus Mining Ventures is a modern incarnation of Azimuth Biochemicals.

The revelation came via a public statement across all media channels:

« This is Salvation. In light of recent speculation, we are rebranding Taurus Mining Ventures as Azimuth Biotech. My intent is to prove that Azimuth has no further need to conceal its operations. »

« Two centuries ago, Azimuth's pioneers first acquired evidence of the alien creatures now referred to as Thargoids. My research division focused exclusively on studying this life form and preparing for the inevitable inter-species conflict. When Azimuth Biochemicals was commercially overtaken by Pharmasapien over a century ago, I ensured key assets and personnel were removed from company records prior to the acquisition. We continued our research in secret, free from shareholders and corporate espionage. »

« Since then, my team has led multiple projects to develop necessary advancements for the inevitable war. Our work with INRA on the mycoid virus was one early success. More recently, locating the Proteus in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 provided us with a key breakthrough in weaponising Guardian technology. »

« My anti-xeno superweapon has already saved billions of lives. Azimuth Biotech is currently developing the next generation of this weapon, with which I intend to permanently cripple the Thargoid war machine. »

« Caleb Wycherley is no more, but his accomplishments laid the foundations for the man I have become. A man whose life goal has always been to save humanity from extinction. »


* Superpowers Stand with Azimuth
The Alliance, Empire and Federation will continue collaborating with Salvation and Azimuth Biotech on anti-xeno operations.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling reviewed the latest developments for Vox Galactica:

« We now know the truth: Azimuth not only survived, but was responsible for many controversial activities. It contributed to the mycoid virus's development, coordinated with Black Flight and oversaw Project Seraph. Now, this notorious organisation enjoys the trust of all three superpowers to eliminate the Thargoid threat. »

« Vocal members of the Assembly, Congress and Senate have called for everyone at Azimuth Biotech \u2013 formerly Taurus Mining Ventures \u2013 to be arrested as criminals. Professor Alba Tesreau has demanded justice for the crew of the Alexandria, which was sabotaged by Azimuth to obtain its cargo of Guardian artefacts. »

« But Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders have all deferred to their militaries to determine a course of action until the current war's end. Their perspective can be summed up by Admiral Maxton Price's comment: 'Without Salvation's superweapon, we will be locked in conflict with the Thargoids forever.' »

« Many still claim that the INRA outpost at DG Canum Venaticorum was faked by Aegis loyalists. Others noted that Salvation did not confirm that he is Caleb Wycherley, and is potentially a far younger man building upon his predecessor's research. »

« The reality is that the momentum of Salvation's campaign is now too strong to be diverted. As is often the case during wartime, legality and morality have been set aside to focus on achieving victory. Azimuth has done more than just survive: it has triumphed. »


* Azimuth: A Historical Perspective (Part One)
Beginning a multi-part overview of historical events surrounding Azimuth Biochemicals and its connection to the mysterious Salvation.

On the 29th of October 3306, an abandoned megaship named the Adamastor arrived in the Chukchan system, after travelling at sublight speeds for nearly 200 years. At the time, no one could have foreseen the wide-ranging consequences that would arise from unlocking the secrets of this ghost ship.

Investigations revealed that it had been owned by a little-known and long-defunct corporation called Azimuth Biochemicals. The derelict's journey was traced to the previously unexplored Coalsack Nebula, where the Adamastor had collected the survivors of a planetary survey team from the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.

Back in 3111, these geologists had encountered something terrifying and completely unknown: the first recorded instance of contact with the Thargoids. According to team leader Professor Carver, whose final log was discovered on HIP 69200 1 B, a recovered alien artefact caused equipment malfunctions and delusions among the crew. The damaged Adamastor was abandoned, to finally return home on autopilot two centuries later.

Further exploration of the Coalsack Nebula uncovered nothing more, but did lead to the detection of new barnacle sites. The Alliance wasted no time in harvesting these for meta alloys, followed by a Sirius Corporation project to terraform ammonia worlds. A resurgence of attacks from Thargoid vessels followed, suggesting that the alien species was as territorial as ever.

In April 3307, the Adamastor began receiving a long-range encrypted signal. A decryption key for this was provided by an anonymous source who identified himself only as 'Salvation'. Tracking the signal led to the wreck of the Hesperus, the Adamastor's sister ship. This had disappeared in 3113 and was now drifting in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system.

The distress call had been triggered by a dredger occupied by the nomadic Scriveners Clan, who had salvaged the Hesperus's data drives. Messages leaked from the dredger revealed how the Hesperus had been taken over by sleeper agents from Pharmasapien, the corporate rivals of Azimuth Biochemicals. This resulted in the deaths of all except a scientific team, who had escaped aboard a secondary craft.

Two months later, the enigmatic Salvation asked pilots to track down the Hesperus's signal beacons to find those missing Azimuth crew members. The secondary craft, named Proteus, was subsequently discovered on a moon in the Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 system. Its crew had transformed it into a research facility, to study relics from a nearby ancient battleground between the Guardian and Thargoid races.

The security officer's log told of Azimuth's real purpose: locate non-human technology and weaponise it for the military market. The scientists had conducted dangerous experiments on Guardian crystals, accidentally triggering a radiation surge which wiped them all out.

It seemed that Azimuth's story ended there, nearly 200 years ago. But the fate of the Proteus would have enormous repercussions for the future of the galaxy.


* Azimuth: A Historical Perspective (Part Two)
A summary of key events around the rise and fall of the tri-superpower organisation Aegis.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation created Aegis in 3303 to lead xenological research and coordinate defensive actions against the Thargoids. With fears that the alien species might one day overwhelm human-controlled space, Aegis's role was to spearhead the resistance against a common enemy.

There were concerns that Aegis might adopt the same unethical practices as its notorious predecessor INRA, which had been formed back in 3125 during the First Thargoid War. But the new agency was welcomed by most, providing intelligence on Thargoid activity as well as advanced weapons.

Since capital ships were vulnerable to the Thargoid shutdown field, Aegis soon had no choice but to rely heavily on independent pilots to perform ship-to-ship combat. And despite its effectiveness at coordinating defence, it was criticised for having no strategy to actually defeat the alien threat.

By 3306, Aegis already showed signs of decline. Its Eagle Eye detection network had ceased to provide warnings about Thargoid attacks, and there were no new developments in anti-xeno weaponry. The rise of the NMLA had altered the political landscape, with funding for Aegis being redirected toward countering the terrorists and preparing for possible Federal-Imperial war.

In March 3307, the Galactic Summit failed to ratify the Sirius Treaty, which would have united superpowers, corporations and independent systems against the Thargoids. Instead, Aegis was directed to undertake new research into the Guardians. Their extinct civilisation was thought to hold the key to outmatching the Thargoids' biomechanical technology.

A successful initiative in May 3307 resulted in enormous quantities of Guardian artefacts being delivered to the Aegis megaship Alexandria. Thargoid vessels were drawn to this concentration of technology created by their ancient enemy, and pursued the Alexandria from system to system. When the megaship did not emerge from a hyperspace jump, it was assumed to have been intercepted and destroyed.

An independent board of inquiry was established to investigate the loss of the Alexandria. So thorough was this investigation that most of Aegis's activities were suspended, and many leading figures forced to resign. Public confidence in the agency was low, with a general sense that it was no longer fit for purpose.

In November 3307, Aegis was brought further into disrepute when its chief military liaison went rogue. Admiral Aden Tanner led an unauthorised assault against Hind Mine in the T Tauri system, the headquarters of Salvation's corporate ally Taurus Mining Ventures. Tanner was convinced that Salvation's activities deliberately provoked the Thargoids and that the starport contained evidence of this. His actions would result in failure and court martial, accelerating Aegis's fall from grace.

The Baumann Report, which published the inquiry's findings in January 3308, exposed endemic weaknesses including negligence, poor management, and the treatment of pilots as disposable mercenaries. The casualties resulting from the Alexandria disaster and the Hind Mine attack were the final nails in the agency's coffin.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation announced that Aegis would be replaced by devolved anti-xeno taskforces. Its support megaships, still active during Thargoid incursions, were crewed by volunteers until the combat logistics corporation Frontline Solutions agreed to operate them.

Even after the true fate of the Alexandria was discovered, along with data supporting Admiral Tanner's suspicions, the collapse of Aegis was by now irreversible. For in recent months, Salvation had achieved impressive results on a scale that no military power could hope to match.


* Azimuth: A Historical Perspective (Part Four)
A look at the rivalry between Aegis and Salvation during the escalating war against the Thargoids.

Salvation's success in purging the Thargoid presence from the Cornsar system had many repercussions, not least from the aliens themselves. Several inhabited nebulas were suddenly overrun with Thargoid vessels, leading some to believe they were reacting aggressively to the Guardian-based nature of the anti-xeno superweapon.

Aegis's hands were tied by the ongoing public inquiry, but its chief military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner was convinced that the superweapon was designed to attract Thargoids as well as repel them. Claiming that evidence for this could be found at Hind Mine in the T Tauri system, he commanded the megaship Musashi to launch an assault.

This was a battle that Taurus Mining Ventures won with much support from independent pilots, showing how much faith was now placed in Salvation. Tanner was court martialled and the captured Musashi became the flagship of Salvation's growing forces. Commodore Morag Halloran, formerly of the Alliance Defence Force, took command and became his military coordinator.

By December 3307, the Alliance, Empire and Federation had officially acknowledged that Salvation possessed the technology required to defeat the Thargoids. This assumption was then put to the test when the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems suffered simultaneous full-scale invasions.

Once again the Thargoids were routed following the detonation of three newly constructed superweapons, repeating Salvation's success at Cornsar. His triumphant proclamations now verged on the messianic « I urge the peoples of the galaxy to unite behind my crusade. Aegis is finished. I am the only remaining defence for humanity. I am Salvation. »

By this point, public opinion toward Salvation was generally positive. Volunteers flocked to Taurus Mining Ventures to offer support, with naval crews from the superpowers defecting to take part in battling the Thargoids. Secondment to Salvation's forces soon became officially authorised, showing an increasing acceptance of the anonymous scientist's methods and results.

January 3308 saw a number of developments. Admiral Tanner's court martial was interrupted by a statement from the renowned scientist Ram Tah, confirming the non-human origins of Salvation's superweapon. Ram Tah theorised that it was based on a Guardian device found by Azimuth Biochemicals scientists at the Proteus site, which generated an electromagnetic pulse to disrupt the Thargoids' biomechanical vessels.

But this justification of Tanner's concerns was not enough to prevent the inevitable fall of Aegis. The Baumann Report delivered a damning indictment of the agency's operations, concluding that it should be shut down. The three superpowers began using their own militaries to replace Aegis with separate anti-xeno taskforces.

A more surprising event that month was the discovery of debris from the missing megaship Alexandria, scattered across the planetary rings of Wregoe TC-X b29-0 AB 2 A. Captain Morales's report revealed that the ship had emerged from hyperspace off course due to sabotage, before being raided by a quasi-military force which hijacked its cargo of Guardian artefacts. The surviving crew's attempt to restart the damaged hyperdrive was the cause of the Alexandria's destruction.

Morales also mentioned that the raiders were obeying orders from someone named 'the Witch'. This detail was seized upon by Aegis's remaining leaders, who matched it to abandoned research facilities found in August 3307 within the HIP 22460 and HIP 26176 systems. These were the sites of the mysterious Project Seraph, an attempt to install human pilots into a captured Thargoid scout. Both the Witch and Azimuth were referenced in its surviving logs.

Aegis's warning was clear Azimuth Biochemicals, which was supposedly liquidated two centuries ago, had survived to the present day.


* Azimuth A Historical Perspective (Part Three)
An overview of how Aegis was impacted by the rise of Salvation as a competing anti-xeno force.

« For now I cannot provide you with my credentials. Suffice to say that I am a man of science, unconnected with modern politics. I am recruiting agents to investigate the work undertaken by Azimuth Biochemicals two hundred years ago, which I believe to be of enormous scientific importance. Much has been lost in that time, but our dedication will allow us to rewrite history. »

This was how the anonymous figure known only as Salvation introduced himself to Pilots' Federation members in April 3307. Faceless and voiceless, he remains unseen to the present day. His messages characterised him as a dedicated scientist, one with enormous confidence in achieving his goal to destroy the Thargoids and « save all of humanity ».

It was clear that Salvation possessed detailed knowledge about Azimuth Biochemicals, without which the Hesperus would not have been discovered. He began recruiting independent pilots to undertake missions via the intermediary of Taurus Mining Ventures, a corporation based in the remote T Tauri system.

After locating the Proteus in June 3307, Salvation claimed exclusive rights to exploit the ancient Guardian-Thargoid battleground on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a. This was contested by Aegis, but their initiative to gather Guardian artefacts from the site was eclipsed by Taurus Mining Ventures's campaign. In a short time, Salvation successfully emerged as a rival to Aegis, claiming that the tri-superpower agency could not be trusted.

This was reinforced after the tragic loss of the Alexandria megaship. Due to its cargo of Guardian artefacts, Thargoids had relentlessly pursued the megaship before it vanished in hyperspace. An independent inquiry into the disaster ordered Aegis's operations to be suspended, leaving an absence that Salvation was keen to exploit.

In September 3307, Salvation warned of an impending Thargoid attack in the Cornsar system, apparently detected by his version of Eagle Eye. Aegis and local factions dismissed this as highly unlikely, but nevertheless Thargoid vessels did swarm into the system.

Salvation again reached out to pilots and asked them to transport vital equipment from a Taurus Mining Ventures megaship to Cornsar, for a prototype weapon that he was constructing. A counter-initiative took place by Commanders who distrusted Salvation or supported Aegis, illustrating that each now had their supporters among the galactic community.

Four days later, the Thargoid invasion force unexpectedly vanished from Cornsar. Most withdrew into hyperspace, but crashed alien vessels remained on some planetary bodies. Salvation revealed he had developed an anti-xeno superweapon, capable of eliminating the Thargoid presence from an entire star system. « I have achieved what Aegis could not \u2013 an effective deterrent against the alien threat. »

The nature of this incredible new weapon remained unclear, but evidence of Guardian technology later found in Cornsar raised a disturbing possibility. Did Salvation really detect the approaching Thargoid fleet Or did he deliberately attract the Thargoids to Cornsar by stockpiling huge quantities of Guardian artefacts \u2013 as happened on the Alexandria \u2013 in order to test his prototype superweapon.

As a Vox Galactica report put it « Time will tell if Salvation's ambition to replace Aegis is a noble goal, or if we are replacing the devil we know with a darker demon. »


* Azimuth A Historical Perspective (Part Five)
The concluding article in this series examines events leading to the resurrection of Azimuth and Salvation's plans for the future.

During February and March 3308, Aegis suffered a slow death as its operations were shut down by the superpowers. Its leaders continued calling for its reinstatement, not just to battle the Thargoids but also to oppose Azimuth Biochemicals. They claimed that this sinister corporation was still performing unlicensed xenological research and was responsible for thousands of deaths.

Meanwhile, the number of Thargoid incursions was increasing, perhaps in response to Salvation's Guardian-based superweapon. This culminated in a simultaneous invasion of the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems in April 3308. These were major population centres for the Alliance, Empire and Federation respectively, with over ten billion lives at risk.

Salvation and the superpower militaries responded in concert. Allied, Imperial and Federal capital ships were deployed to coordinate system defences, and also host the construction of three new superweapons. Interviews with the admirals in charge of the anti-xeno taskforces provided an insight into how much they now relied on Salvation.

The superweapons were successfully detonated in all three systems, but this time there were no wreckages left behind. It was unclear if these particular weapons were less effective, or if the Thargoids had anticipated their use and retreated before their vessels could be disrupted.

This was nevertheless hailed as another victory for Salvation. He announced that he was working on the next generation of the devices, which would « deliver a truly overwhelming strike against the Thargoid species ». Increased amounts of personnel, supplies and equipment were provided to Taurus Mining Ventures to hasten development of the superweapon.

In May 3308 came a shocking revelation. Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, received a tip-off leading to an abandoned outpost in the DG Canum Venaticorum system. This turned out to be a previously undiscovered base for INRA, the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm, which was formed to combat the Thargoids during the 32nd and 33rd centuries.

The base provided evidence that INRA had contracted Azimuth Biochemicals to aid development of the mycoid virus. This was a highly controversial bioweapon used in 3151 to infect the aliens' mothership, and which helped bring about the end of the First Thargoid War.

Logs recorded by Dr Caleb Wycherley, the corporation's vice-president of research, explained how he gained the nickname 'the Witch' after being half-blinded by a live Thargoid specimen. He then vowed that under his guidance, Azimuth would devote itself to the destruction of the Thargoids « If I must be humanity's salvation, then so be it. »

The former leaders of Aegis claimed that this verified their theory Salvation and 'the Witch' were the same person, and Azimuth had been operating in the shadows for decades. Professor Tesreau later revealed that the tip-off came from Subject D-2, the only survivor of the Project Seraph experiments to create a human test pilot for Thargoid ships.

Some believed Aegis had fabricated these logs, since Dr Wycherley would now be over 200 years old. But although Salvation did not overtly confirm his true identity, Aegis's suspicions were validated when Taurus Mining Ventures rebranded itself as Azimuth Biotech. Salvation described how Azimuth's research division had survived as an independent organisation under his control, focused exclusively on Thargoid research and preparing for inter-species conflict.

There was a public outcry that the man claiming to be humanity's saviour was also responsible for the mycoid bioweapon, Project Seraph, the attack on the Alexandria, and other illegal or unethical activities. And yet there was little reaction from the Alliance, Empire or Federation, whose militaries were now fully committed to working with Salvation to defeat the Thargoids.

In the past week, there have been signs that Azimuth Biotech is mobilising its forces and preparing for a large-scale operation of some kind. This may well tie in with Salvation's promise to unveil a more powerful type of anti-xeno superweapon. We may soon learn if Azimuth can repeat history and deliver the decisive blow to end to the Second Thargoid War.


* 'Operation Wych Hunt' Opposes Azimuth Biotech
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A coalition of independent Commanders has been formed to destabilise Salvation's anti-xeno organisation.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation are providing military backing to Azimuth Biotech \u2013 formerly Taurus Mining Ventures \u2013 to end the Thargoid threat. Many members of the Pilots' Federation have also declared their support, but some have organised a resistance movement.

To undermine Azimuth Biotech's presence in several systems, a series of civil actions and combat strikes are being coordinated under the banner 'Operation Wych Hunt'. This refers to evidence that suggests Salvation's real name is Dr Caleb Wycherley, also referred to as 'the Witch' in several sources.

The Commanders are directly protesting against Salvation, claiming he is responsible for numerous illegal activities that resulted in multiple deaths. These include developing the mycoid bioweapon for INRA, Project Seraph's inhumane experiments to create human interfaces to Thargoid ships, and the destruction of the Alexandria with the loss of 4,000 crewmembers. As summarised in their mission statement: 'We do not support a mass murderer. Salvation, we can save ourselves.'

Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, spoke publicly in support of the operation: « The superpowers have been seduced by the promises of a remorseless criminal. But as these courageous pilots prove, not everyone believes that the end justifies the means. »


* Urgent Request for Supplies in HIP 22460
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Medical and military commodities are needed to support the cross-superpower operation in the HIP 22460 system.

Commodore Morag Halloran, who is coordinating for Azimuth Biotech aboard the Bright Sentinel megaship, outlined the requirements:

« The Proteus Wave is designed to attract the bulk of the Thargoid fleet before destroying them. We are making preparations to defend Salvation from the alien vessels until the superweapon is ready. »

« Azimuth Biotech is offering generous payment for shipments of advanced medicines, basic medicines and reactive armour. These can be delivered to the Heart of Taurus megaship in HIP 22460. »

« Specially tailored ship liveries are available as additional rewards, in gratitude to those loyal Commanders who are dedicated to Salvation's cause of defeating the Thargoids. »

The anti-xeno taskforces of the Alliance, Empire and Federation are also preparing to engage Thargoid forces in and around HIP 22460. Capital ships have been running combat drills and practising naval manoeuvres. As yet, there is no indication when the anticipated Thargoid fleet may arrive.


* Salvation Prepares 'Final Thargoid Battlefield'
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The HIP 22460 system will be the stage for a decisive strike against the Thargoids by Azimuth Biotech and the superpowers.

The following message was broadcast across all public channels:

« This is Salvation. Construction of the Proteus Wave has officially commenced. This version of my anti-xeno superweapon has been designed to bring absolute victory against our adversaries. »

« HIP 22460 will serve as the final battlefield in the Thargoid war. As with previous superweapons, we anticipate that the Guardian-based technology incorporated within the Proteus Wave will once again attract the Thargoids. However, this time it will eradicate the alien threat not just from the system, but from the entire galaxy. »

« Everyone who wishes to see this hostile species defeated once and for all should view this project as a call to arms. This is not a time for politics or debate. It is an opportunity to secure humanity's continued survival. »

Azimuth Biotech megaships have entered the HIP 22460 system. Commodore Morag Halloran is coordinating the operation aboard the Bright Sentinel. The Heart of Taurus will serve as a delivery point for incoming resources. Two other megaships, Musashi and Glorious Prospect, are in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system to provide further logistical support.

Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy forces have also taken up positions in the HIP 22460 system. These ships have been modified for anti-xeno combat, as they expect to face Thargoid vessels in greater numbers than ever previously encountered. Military sources confirmed that although the ships' experimental weaponry is being deployed somewhat prematurely, it should still prove effective.


* Leaders Respond to Azimuth Initiative
The anti-xeno operation in HIP 22460 involving Azimuth Biotech and the superpowers has drawn comments from prominent political figures.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval: « I agree with Senator Patreus that supporting Azimuth's proposal remains our most practical course of action. However, alternative options for tackling the Thargoid threat are required. »

Princess Aisling Duval: « Salvation is clearly a master of self-promotion and public manipulation. I only hope that the Empire does not regret associating with this distasteful individual. »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon: « Our military presence in HIP 22460, coupled with the strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation, shows that the long-term security of Allied systems remains our priority. »

Councillor Nakato Kaine: « Two ruthless corporations with disreputable histories, and the Alliance is now collaborating with both. This a deeply regrettable chapter in our history. »

President Zachary Hudson: « I have every confidence in the Federal Navy to protect Salvation while the Proteus Wave is prepared. This is a long-overdue reprisal against an intractable and relentless enemy. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters: « Azimuth's superweapon is effective, I'll admit. But I'm unhappy with relying on this clandestine organisation, rather than an accountable anti-xeno agency. »

CEO Li Yong-Rui: « Sirius Corporation is observing activities in HIP 22460 with great interest. I am keen to explore cooperation with Azimuth Biotech on developing new products using Proteus Wave technology. »

Simguru Pranav Antal: « The advanced electromagnetic sciences developed by the Guardians over a million years ago remain poorly understood, even to Utopia's keenest minds. The safety and effectiveness of Salvation's device cannot be guaranteed. »


* Far God Cult Condemns Salvation
Azimuth Biotech's operation in the HIP 22460 system has been publicly denounced by the Thargoid-worshipping fringe religion.

A video message from a hooded young woman aboard the Testament, the cult's missionary vessel, was transmitted directly to the newsfeed Vox Galactica:

« This plan to entrap and destroy the heralds of the Far God must cease immediately. As the newly appointed First Apostle of the True Chapters, I beseech those in authority not to support Salvation's evil crusade. To slaughter these holy beings is a monstrous act of deicide. »

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading authority on the enigmatic sect, commented:

« It is extremely unusual for Far God believers to make any kind of announcement or acknowledge current events. They accept their own deaths with equanimity, believing as they do that all life will be extinguished when the Far God emerges from hyperspace. But they are clearly incensed by Salvation's intention to eliminate the Thargoid fleet, viewing it as a blasphemous attack against their deity. »

« We cannot identify the messenger, although her Imperial accent is a surprise considering the cult has been outlawed in the Empire. 'First Apostle' is an unexpected new rank among their leaderless hierarchy, and suggests she has been elevated to spokesperson status. 'True Chapters' is likewise a departure from their usual sequential numbering, raising the possibility that this is a sub-sect branching off from the orthodox faith. »


* Guardian Artefacts Needed to Power Superweapon
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech urgently requires deliveries of Guardian artefacts to HIP 22460 as vital components of the Proteus Wave.

Salvation issued an official request to the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces, which was then shared via public channels:

« We have now begun assembly of the Proteus Wave. Our existing stockpile of Guardian material was sufficient to begin construction, but we must now establish a supply line capable of delivering the quantity needed to finish the weapon. »

Azimuth Biotech has established an initiative to encourage independent pilots to supply the Bright Sentinel megaship with Guardian commodities. Azimuth are also offering additional ship liveries to contributors.

Pilots can deliver any combination of Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns to the Bright Sentinel megaship in the HIP 22460 system.


* Federation Targets Narcotics Syndicate
The Federal Intelligence Agency has launched a multi-system crackdown against the organised crime network known as Red Family.

Synchronised raids are currently taking place in over a dozen systems across Federal space. Multiple ships, properties and manufacturing plants connected to Red Family's illegal operations are being seized.

FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake provided a statement to The Federal Times:

« For decades the Red Family cartel has trafficked colossal quantities of dangerous drugs to our citizens, leaving a trail of death and misery behind them. The FIA dealt a severe blow to the syndicate in 3305, but its kingpin Oberon Church escaped justice and remains one of the most wanted criminals in the Federation. »

« This current operation was only possible thanks to the Proactive Detection Bureau. Our algorithms intercepted key messages that identified Red Family's allies within local security forces and legal businesses. »

« Field agents are now making mass arrests, despite armed resistance at many locations. This time we will locate Church and take him into custody, which will cause his organisation to crumble. »

The Proactive Detection Bureau monitors all communications within the Federation to identify illegal activity and prevent terrorism. It was established in 3307 when new public surveillance laws were passed in the wake of large-scale attacks by the NMLA.


* HIP 22460 Receives Vital Supplies
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Medical and military commodities have been delivered to the HIP 22460 system in support of the anti-xeno operation.

Commodore Morag Halloran expressed gratitude that so many Commanders took part in the initiative. She indicated that payment was now available from the megaship Heart of Taurus. This includes tailored ship liveries for those Commanders who made the greatest contributions.

Azimuth Biotech has requested that pilots continue supporting the operation by obtaining Guardian artefacts, which will form part of the Proteus Wave's construction process. These can be delivered to the Bright Sentinel megaship.

The shipments of advanced medicines, basic medicines and reactive armour will be distributed by Azimuth Biotech to the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces within the system.

Experimental anti-xeno weaponry has been installed on the three taskforce flagships: the Alliance megaship Oath of Tyndareus, the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Fortitude, and the Majestic-class interdictor INV Audacious Dream. Both the Federal and Imperial Navies intend to reinforce their presence in HIP 22460 at the appropriate time.


* The Salvation Stratagem
As the superpowers establish their fleets in the HIP 22460 system, Azimuth Biotech prepares to deliver a decisive blow against the Thargoids.

A segment from Salvation's briefing to the anti-xeno taskforce admirals was shared by Azimuth:

« The Proteus Wave relies on power sources and components of Guardian origin, which will inevitably draw the Thargoids to HIP 22460. As we know, their hostile reaction to stockpiles of Guardian artefacts is instinctive. They have no defence against the weaponry of their ancient enemies, other than to launch pre-emptive strikes to prevent it being deployed. »

« Therefore, the Bright Sentinel must be protected as a priority while delivered artefacts are processed for transport to the Proteus Wave site, with independent pilots who support our endeavour aiding these efforts. I cannot stress enough how vital it is to keep the enemy at bay during this phase of the plan. »

« The Proteus Wave will be constructed on the surface of HIP 22460 10b. Its core mechanism will be calibrated to interface with one of the extant Thargoid structures present on the moon. The structure will amplify the Proteus Wave's electromagnetic pulse to permanently shut down every Thargoid vessel within range. »

« Providing your combined forces can keep the Thargoid vessels occupied, the finished superweapon will ensure humanity's final victory against the aliens. There will be no need for further superweapons when the Thargoid threat has been extinguished once and for all. »


* Thargoids Launch Attack in HIP 22460
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The HIP 22460 system has been invaded by large numbers of Thargoid vessels, with several multi-craft conflicts already reported.

An alert was broadcast by Commodore Morag Halloran, military coordinator for Azimuth Biotech:

« As Salvation predicted, the Thargoids have detected the large-scale concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Bright Sentinel. Thargoid interceptors and scouts are now swarming throughout HIP 22460. »

« The Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces have engaged the enemy. But it is crucial that their efforts are supplemented by as many additional ships as we can muster. All available independent pilots and AX squadrons are requested to take part in counter-offensives against the Thargoids. »

« It is also important to protect traders who are entering the system to deliver Guardian artefacts to the Bright Sentinel. The construction of the Proteus Wave relies on these vital components, and supply routes must not be interrupted by Thargoid strikes. »

The Alliance megaship Oath of Tyndareus, the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Fortitude, and the Majestic-class interdictor INV Audacious Dream are coordinating the tactical deployment of the superpowers' taskforces in HIP 22460.


* Red Family Kingpin Eludes the FIA
Oberon Church, founder of the crime syndicate Red Family, has managed to avoid capture by the Federal Intelligence Agency.

The Federal Times's crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported on the latest developments:

« In many ways, the FIA's operation against Red Family can be considered a success. Coordinated raids and arrests have seized most of the organisation's assets, including colossal amounts of illegal narcotics and weapons. »

« But Oberon Church has lived up to his self-styled image as 'the man of smoke', forever drifting through the fingers of those who try to grasp him. And until this notorious drug lord is finally apprehended, the agency cannot relent in its work. »

« Proactive Detection Bureau analysts are working to decrypt communications found on captured data drives. They believe these include coordinates where the surviving syndicate members are gathering to protect their leader. »

« Several FIA agents have told me that the opportunity to take Church captive is narrowing. They fear that unless the PDB can pinpoint Red Family's bolthole soon, he will once again escape justice. »


* Guardian Artefact Initiative Enters Second Phase
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has repeated its call for Guardian artefacts to be delivered to the HIP 22460 system.

Military coordinator Commodore Morag Halloran announced the details:

« Over the last week, many Commanders have scoured Guardian sites to collect artefacts and transport them to HIP 22460. We are grateful for their efforts, and payment is now available at the Bright Sentinel. »

« The Proteus Wave, currently being constructed aboard the megaship, requires increasing quantities of Guardian-based technology. Azimuth Biotech has confirmed the artefact acquisition initiative will continue for a second week and would like more pilots to take part. »

« Passage through the HIP 22460 system has become hazardous, with Thargoid vessels present in large numbers. The Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces are striving to protect traders, as are independent AX fighters and squadrons. However, as the concentration of artefacts increases, it's expected that the Thargoid presence will intensify. Pilots should remain on high alert while in the system. »

Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns can all be delivered to the Bright Sentinel megaship, which remains in stationary orbit above HIP 22460 10b.


* The Battle of HIP 22460
Vox Galactica has published an on-site account from the HIP 22460 system, where a coalition fleet is engaged in combat with the Thargoids.

« This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. I've been in HIP 22460 over the past two weeks, and during this time the system has been transformed into a ferocious battleground. »

« Naval and independent craft are fighting side by side against the biomechanical nightmares that are Thargoid vessels. Many brave pilots have lost their lives to the aliens' firepower, several of whom I spoke to only hours before. The official casualty numbers are climbing rapidly. But so far the coalition is holding the line. »

« The Bright Sentinel is at the eye of the storm, aboard which high concentrations of Guardian devices are being prepared for integration with the Proteus Wave device on HIP 22460 10b. We know little about this superweapon's properties, considering its origins stem from the technology of a long-extinct civilisation. Perhaps only Salvation can claim such an understanding. But he is certainly not willing to share his unique knowledge, since it has placed all three superpowers at his beck and call. »

« Despite the constant danger, most personnel I've spoken to are optimistic. There is a sense of comradeship, of humanity working together against a common enemy. But among them are those who view Salvation as untrustworthy at best, and a mass murderer at worst. Some pilots have even mounted a resistance campaign against Azimuth, convinced that it is the cause of the Thargoids' aggression rather than the solution. »

« This mirrors the results of a recent study by Orion University into public sentiment towards Salvation's grand plan. The campaign in HIP 22460 enjoys general social network support from users fatigued by this years-long war, particularly following Salvation's claims of complete victory. Others remain sceptical of Salvation, citing concerns over the Proteus Wave's future as well as historical crimes committed by Azimuth personnel. A small demographic, recently given a voice by popular ICE creator Joy Senne, has suggested that Salvation's influence has actively prevented efforts to communicate with the Thargoids, dashing hopes of a diplomatic solution to the conflict. »

« Could HIP 22460 really be the final battle of the Second Thargoid War? Many combat pilots here are convinced that Salvation can achieve this, and are willing to die for his cause. Right now, we can only wait and hope that their continued sacrifices are worthwhile. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Support Federal Strike Against Crime Syndicate
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Federation has offered bounties to hunt down all surviving Red Family ships in the Andowatye system.

Executive Agent Faisal Sacranie of the Federal Intelligence Agency released this statement:

« Information provided by the Proactive Detection Bureau revealed that the notorious Oberon Church has gathered his remaining followers in Andowatye. Our mission to take down the narcotics syndicate is not complete until its kingpin has been arrested and charged for his long list of crimes. »

« The FIA has authorised hiring independent pilots to act as auxiliaries for this operation. We are working closely with the United Andowatye Democrats, which has placed bounties on all wanted ships in this system. »

« It is crucial that our agents locate Oberon Church before he departs from the system. If we cannot eliminate his defenders in time, he may once again escape justice and re-establish his drugs empire from the shadows. We have a duty to all Federal citizens to prevent this from happening. »

The United Andowatye Democrats has confirmed that contributing pilots can redeem bounty vouchers at Bosch Station in the Andowatye system.


* Pilots Urged to Defend Proteus Wave Project
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

As the Thargoid presence increases in the HIP 22460 system, Azimuth Biotech and the superpowers call for reinforcements.

An urgent bulletin was transmitted from Commodore Morag Halloran aboard the Bright Sentinel:

« A series of actions by 'Operation Wych Hunt' saboteurs have resulted in delays to Azimuth Biotech's supply infrastructure. As a result of these traitorous acts, we have been forced to amend the construction timetable for the Proteus Wave. »

« Salvation informs me that it will be approximately two more weeks until the weapon is fully assembled. This delay increases the Proteus Wave's exposure to Thargoid intervention, potentially undermining the project. But we remain convinced that the majority of pilots are committed to ensuring a human victory. »

« After discussions with Admiral Atherton, Admiral Price and Admiral Ziegler, the coalition has agreed to provide funding for increased defences in HIP 22460. For the next two weeks, independent pilots can claim reimbursement for the hazardous task of engaging the Thargoids. »

« Thargoid combat bonds can be handed in at the Musashi megaship in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system. The most dedicated Commanders by contribution will be rewarded with Salvation's pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannons. »


* Azimuth's Plan Elicits Further Reactions
Prominent figures on the political stage have commented on Salvation's anti-xeno operation in the HIP 22460 system. Key points from each are collated below.

Archon Delaine: « My opinion on the Thargoids remains the same: burn them all! As I stated at the Galactic Summit, the Kumo nation stands ready to help wipe out these alien scum. »

Yuri Grom: « I trust Salvation as little as I trust the Federation. What guarantee do we have that this Proteus Wave will not be turned against human targets, once the Thargoids are dealt with? »

Senator Zemina Torval: « Azimuth Biotech has emerged as a strategically significant corporation. I've advised the Imperial Senate to establish long-term commercial links that are mutually beneficial. »

Hadrian Augustus Duval: « The Thargoids are a genuine threat. Yet I hope that our military collaboration with the Alliance and the Federation is a temporary measure only. The Empire must develop the strength to stand alone. »

First Minister Octavia Volkov: « Thargoid attack is an ever-present danger for the Marlinist Colonies. We are observing events closely. Personally I do not view Azimuth as a trustworthy ally. »

Ambassador Jasmina Halsey: « I'm pleased to see the Federation working closely with the Alliance, but disappointed that it is limited to anti-xeno matters. Whatever happens in HIP 22460, we should grasp this opportunity to increase diplomatic as well as military cooperation. »


* The Xenocide Debate
As construction proceeds on Salvation's Proteus Wave, there is widespread dispute on the issue of eliminating the Thargoids.

An article by Heimar Borichev, deputy editor of The Sovereign newsfeed, has divided public opinion:

« Salvation's latest superweapon is designed to attract and then destroy members of the species we've named 'Thargoids'. If successful, it would wipe them from the core systems entirely. But there are a number of questions that nobody seems to be asking, including this: do we have the right to take such action? »

« What's that, you say? The Thargoids are the aggressors, out to destroy humanity? Or are they just defending historical territory from our expanding presence? Remember, they were navigating space a million years before we were. If a new species suddenly emerged on our worlds and began strip-mining our lands, how would we react? »

« Now, I'm not suggesting we should pledge ourselves to the Far God cult and start praying to Thargoids. But how much of the considerable military budget spent on this interspecies war could have been saved by a simple conversation? Has anyone genuinely attempted to communicate with them? If we'd been more focused on diplomacy instead of extermination, we might have found a way to parley with the Thargoids by now. How many lives could have been saved if our two races had exchanged a few words? »

« I maintain there is no justification for xenocide. This whole war is as manufactured as our name for these beings. Ask yourself why the superpowers would like you to believe they're fighting monsters who can't be reasoned with. Ask yourself how this benefits the politicians, the corporations, weapons manufacturers, security forces. Ask yourself who the real monsters are. »


* Azimuth's Final Call for Guardian Artefacts
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The campaign to deliver Guardian artefacts to Azimuth Biotech in the HIP 22460 system has reached its third phase.

Commodore Morag Halloran outlined the final stage of the initiative:

« We have received an impressive number of Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns at the Bright Sentinel over the past two weeks. Thanks to this supply, construction of the Proteus Wave has progressed satisfactorily. »

« However, Salvation has requested that further shipments of artefacts are sourced from Guardian sites. There can be no shortfall of these vital components, and the superweapon will make use of every one we can provide. »

« We have projected a substantial increase in the number of Thargoid vessels within HIP 22460, as they react to the increased concentration of technology created by their ancient enemies. AX fighters and squadrons are asked to continue engaging the enemy's forces to provide safe passage for incoming transports. »

Pilots who previously contributed to this initiative can collect rewards from the Bright Sentinel megaship in HIP 22460, which is continuing to accept new shipments of Guardian artefacts.


* Proteus Wave Approaches Completion
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

New Federal and Imperial capital ships have arrived in HIP 22460 as Azimuth Biotech's operation nears its conclusion.

The following message was provided to all newsfeeds for public broadcast:

« This is Salvation. The Proteus Wave's core mechanism will be fully constructed one week from today. We will then begin integration with the surface site on HIP 22460 10b, using designs of mine which are unique to the superweapon's operation. »

« As anticipated, the Thargoid presence in the HIP 22460 system has escalated considerably. Providing the sufficient majority of their fleet is within range of the Proteus Wave, the casualties will be devastating enough to drive the Thargoids out of the core systems forever. »

« I urge all superpower-affiliated and independent ships to hold the line. Only through determination and sacrifice will we finish our crucial work. »

In HIP 22460, the Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have each deployed additional capital ships as the conflict has grown in scale and ferocity. These huge vessels are directing large-scale firepower against the Thargoids.

Independent pilots are also being incentivised to destroy the alien vessels, with opportunities to obtain Salvation's pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannons. Thargoid combat bonds can be redeemed at the Musashi in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system.

Azimuth Biotech's campaign for Guardian artefacts, which form the most vital components of the Proteus Wave, is now in its final phase. Deliveries can be made to the Bright Sentinel megaship in HIP 22460 until Tuesday the 26th of July.


* Criminals Crushed by Federal Campaign
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A Federal operation in the Andowatye system has finally brought down the Red Family crime syndicate.

Executive Agent Faisal Sacranie of the Federal Intelligence Agency announced the successful conclusion:

« I am pleased to confirm that FIA agents were able to capture Oberon Church, the so-called 'man of smoke', as well as his surviving lieutenants. With its kingpin's arrest and most remaining forces destroyed, the Red Family organisation no longer exists as a functional crime organisation. »

« On behalf of the FIA, I am grateful to all pilots who helped eliminate these felons. The United Andowatye Democrats  will redeem bounty vouchers for all contributors at Bosch Station in the Andowatye system. »

Vice President Jerome Archer gave a statement to The Federal Times:

« One of the Federation's most notorious organised crime networks has been eradicated, largely due to vital information obtained by the Proactive Detection Bureau. Its ability to unearth enemies of the Federation and bring them to justice remains unparalleled. »

The Proactive Detection Bureau was created when Vice President Archer successfully passed public surveillance legislation in 3307. Political commentators have theorised that Archer's presidential campaign next year will stress the PDB's role in high-profile victories such as the defeat of Jupiter's Wrath and Red Family.


* The View from the Front Line
Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn has broadcast an update on the conflict taking place in the HIP 22460 system.

« The fierce fighting in HIP 22460 has intensified over the past week. Swarms of Thargoid vessels can be encountered throughout the system, cutting down any ill-prepared ships within range. The combined human forces are battling furiously to diminish the alien fleet. »

« A total of seven capital ships, all armed with experimental weaponry, are now providing support for AX squadrons. I've been mesmerised by the intense volleys of energy beams that flash from these gigantic craft, seeking out the dark-hulled Thargoids as they swoop and spin with an eerie grace. Distance offers these sights a strange beauty, a distraction from the ugly fact that many lives are lost with each skirmish. »

« It appears the Alliance's military pact with Sirius Corporation is starting to gain traction. The megaship El Centinela Cadejo recently arrived in Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 from Arimpox, providing logistical support for the Alliance Defence Force in HIP 22460. My military contacts inform me that Azimuth Biotech had sought to restrict Sirius Corporation vessels from participating in the Proteus Wave campaign, perhaps fearful of corporate espionage. Li Yong-Rui would approve of the rather deliberate choice to move El Centinela Cadejo to the same system as Azimuth's Musashi and Glorious Prospect megaships. »

« Meanwhile, the hellish situation in HIP 22460 rages on. I've reported from several battlefields, but this one is something of an endurance test. Every day I watch squadrons deploy to a conflict, and every day watch them return with fewer vessels. All I can do is hope that this carnage will eventually lead to something worthwhile. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Azimuth Condemns 'Alien-Loving' Resistance
As its anti-xeno initiative in HIP 22460 continues, Azimuth Biotech has been deliberately targeted by protestors in other systems.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, made a public broadcast from the corporation's headquarters at Hind Mine starport:

« Azimuth Biotech is dedicated to the vision of Salvation, whose expertise will soon quash the Thargoid blight once and for all. The Alliance, Empire and Federation have put aside their differences to turn this ambition into a reality. But a fractious minority are determined to prevent this, giving the Thargoids a window of opportunity to avoid their fate. »

« Almost immediately after our corporate rebrand from Taurus Mining Ventures, Azimuth came under attack. A rabble of buccaneers and political agitators forcibly expelled our assets from the Merope and Qarato systems. Only by extreme and costly means were we able to retain Hind Mine, as the mob rampaged through the once-peaceful T Tauri system. »

« Their appalling acts have not only endangered Azimuth Biotech's long-term financial growth, but also delayed the manufacture of the Proteus Wave in HIP 22460. Perhaps 'Operation Wych Hunt' is made up of deranged Far God cultists, since they seem hell-bent on sabotaging humanity's greatest defence against the Thargoids. »

« Naturally, Azimuth Biotech has petitioned the relevant authorities to take appropriate action. We are also reaching out to any independent pilots who supported Salvation's past projects. To these loyal to his cause, I implore you to defend our noble enterprise. Show these alien-loving traitors that they are on the wrong side of history. »


* Guardian Artefact Campaign Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The third phase of an initiative to acquire Guardian artefacts for the Proteus Wave has ended successfully.

Commodore Morag Halloran, Azimuth Biotech's military coordinator, announced:

« Salvation has asked me to extend his sincere thanks to all pilots for exploring ancient Guardian sites and transporting their discoveries to the Bright Sentinel in HIP 22460. The quantity of artefacts delivered over the past three weeks has surpassed our targets. »

« The most recent shipments are now being ferried down to the surface of HIP 22460 10b. The Proteus Wave's core mechanism is mere days away from being fully assembled. Calibration tests will then begin within the Thargoid structure, which will vastly amplify the superweapon's disruptive frequencies. »

« It is now mission critical to defend the project. The Thargoids appear frenzied by the system's concentration of Guardian technology, which is drawing their vessels in ever-greater numbers. I am liaising closely with the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces, but we require even more volunteers to provide tactical support to their capital ships. »

With the delivery initiative concluded, contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from the Bright Sentinel megaship in the HIP 22460 system.


* Tesreau Highlights Azimuth's 'Inhumanity'
A counter-statement regarding Azimuth Biotech has been published by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis.

« The recent declaration by Director Torben Rademaker paints a false picture of those pilots who are actively working against Azimuth Biotech. He frames them as criminals and alien sympathisers, betraying humanity to the Thargoids. This could not be any further from the truth. It is Azimuth's own inhumanity that they are fighting against. »

« It's unsurprising that Salvation's focus is now on HIP 22460, given this system has long been part of Azimuth's sinister legacy. On planet 7c is the abandoned settlement Fort Asch, where unlicensed scientists performed monstrous experiments to link human minds with Thargoid vessels. We know from Project Seraph's sole survivor, known as Subject D-2, how brutal the results were. »

« Alongside the Bright Sentinel above planet 10b is the Overlook, a derelict megaship drifting within a caustic cloud of debris. Some may have assumed it is the scene of a recent Thargoid attack, but in fact it once served as the headquarters of Black Flight. This secretive organisation arranged strike teams to suppress evidence of the Thargoids from the general public. Azimuth's collaboration with Black Flight helped it establish a monopoly on xenological research. »

« For the past two centuries, Azimuth has ruthlessly sought to obtain and weaponise alien technology. The crew of the Alexandria were sacrificed in order to steal Guardian material for its superweapon. Now that same genocidal device, paid for with the blood of thousands, is being hailed as a 'noble enterprise'. »

« Caleb Wycherley has reinvented himself as Salvation, but his modern persona cannot conceal his malignant nature. Those who Rademaker accused of betrayal are in fact driven by conscience and a sense of justice. I call upon the leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation to follow their example, and withdraw support for this nefarious organisation. »


* Thargoid Salvage Operation Requires Resources
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has called for commodities to be delivered to the Glorious Prospect in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, outlined the new initiative:

« Once the Proteus Wave has eliminated the Thargoids, the second phase of our corporate strategy will commence. As per our agreement with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, Azimuth Biotech is licensed to collect limited quantities of any remaining non-human material in the HIP 22460 system. The powerless Thargoid vessels will be taken to specialised laboratories for examination, and the subsequent results shared with the superpowers' military intelligence divisions. »

« Unfortunately, Azimuth has experienced significant losses in several systems, as a result of actions taken by 'Operation Wych Hunt' saboteurs. This has prevented us from setting up research labs and analytical equipment, delaying our xeno-retrieval programme considerably. »

« To counteract this setback, we require shipments of HN shock mounts, micro controllers and radiation baffles. The Glorious Prospect megaship stands ready in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system to receive these deliveries. »

As well as credit payments, Azimuth Biotech has agreed to make pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons available as an additional reward for pilots who transport the greatest volume of commodities.


* Superweapon Construction Completed
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Work on the Proteus Wave in the HIP 22460 system has concluded, according to an announcement from Azimuth Biotech.

« This is Salvation. The core mechanism of the Proteus Wave is now fully assembled. Under my guidance, specialists are performing checks at the selected site on HIP 22460 10 b. Additional power capacitors are also being installed to improve energy transfer management. »

« Over the next few days, the Proteus Wave will be calibrated within one of the Thargoid structures, the unique properties of which will greatly amplify the weapon's signal. This breakthrough was only made possible due to decades of xenological research conducted by Azimuth, alongside pioneering theories on cross-species interfaces. »

« Commodore Halloran reports that even greater numbers of Thargoid vessels have arrived within the Proteus Wave's effective range. But it is now absolutely critical that they are prevented from approaching the planet. At all costs, the superweapon must be protected until it is ready for activation. »

The Allied, Federal and Imperial anti-xeno taskforces continue to engage Thargoid forces within the HIP 22460 system. Volunteers are still urgently needed to support their capital ships and take part in defending the Proteus Wave project. The Musashi, an Azimuth megaship in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system, will redeem all Thargoid combat bonds.


* Superpowers Commit to Salvation
The leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation have publicly confirmed their support for Azimuth Biotech's anti-xeno operation in HIP 22460.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon reiterated his position during an interview with the Old Worlds Gazette:

« It is our duty to protect the peoples of the Alliance. Since we currently lack a dedicated naval fleet, we must rely on partnerships with key military providers. With Salvation's advanced weaponry and Sirius Corporation's large-scale logistical might, Allied worlds have never been safer from Thargoid attack. »

The Imperial Senate discussed Professor Alba Tesreau's accusations of criminality against Azimuth Biotech, to which Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval responded:

« Professor Tesreau remains a respected member of the Achenar Research Council, but a single viewpoint cannot eclipse the strategic significance of the Proteus Wave project. Our military experts are confident that, should the weapon deliver on the promises Salvation has made, the Thargoid threat will be diminished. A review of the situation will then be conducted. »

During a promotional tour of marine training centres in the Eta Cassiopeiae system, President Zachary Hudson told reporters:

« Director Rademaker is absolutely correct: those who deliberately sabotage Azimuth Biotech's operations are only helping the Thargoids, which is tantamount to treason. The Federation's citizens have the right to live without fear of alien invasion, and Salvation's ingenuity will help us preserve that right. »

One Allied megaship, three Farragut-class battle cruisers and three Majestic-class interdictors are currently deployed in the HIP 22460 system to defend the Proteus Wave against the Thargoids.


* Resources Supplied to Xeno-Retrieval Programme
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A delivery campaign in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system has provided vital commodities to Azimuth Biotech.

The technical materials will enable Azimuth to analyse the salvaged wreckages of Thargoid vessels, following the activation of the Proteus Wave in the HIP 22460 system.

Captain Maxim Lagunov, commanding officer of the Glorious Prospect megaship, delivered a statement to conclude the initiative:

« Over the last week, I have been pleased to witness so many ships arriving at the Glorious Prospect in response to Director Rademaker's request. Our cargo holds are now well stocked with HN shock mounts, micro controllers, neofabric insulation and radiation baffles. My crew are already arranging for these to be distributed to Azimuth's xenological research centres. »

« Pilots who signed up to this campaign can now collect credit payments. We also have a limited stock of pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons, which have been ferried across from our sister ship Bright Sentinel, and these will be awarded to the most dedicated contributors. »

The Glorious Prospect will remain in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system alongside the Musashi, which is offering anti-xeno weaponry and redeeming Thargoid combat bonds. Two other Azimuth megaships, Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus, are in the nearby HIP 22460 system where the Proteus Wave project is approaching readiness.


* Azimuth Divides Media Opinion
Editorial pieces published by newsfeeds across the core systems illustrate a range of viewpoints on current events in HIP 22460.

Eye on Achenar: « There is no doubt that the real threat to our Empire will arise once the Thargoids are gone. That's when Federal aggression will undoubtedly resume, fuelled by centuries of envy at our glorious splendour. »

Citizens' Chronicle: « Some may have mocked Princess Aisling Duval for describing Salvation as 'a master of self-promotion and public manipulation'. But her political instincts are astute, and we believe she is right to warn us against this dangerous man. »

Sol Today: « We can all see what will happen as soon as the Thargoids have been dealt with. The Imperials will declare war against our democracy, seeking to enforce their totalitarian regime upon freedom-loving Federal citizens. »

Federal Free Press: « The government's focus on Salvation means that vital domestic issues are being ignored. Our economy is still geared toward military spending rather than helping those families and communites who rely on state support. »

Old Worlds Gazette: « Cooperating with Sirius Corporation to harvest meta-alloys in the Coalsack Nebula was the primary cause of increased hostility from the Thargoids. Is the Alliance responsible for providing the conditions that allowed Salvation to obtain such power? »

The Tau Ceti Journal: « Senior figures in the business sector are concerned that Azimuth Biotech, despite some recent market uncertainty, has the potential to become the most influential corporation with all three superpowers. Its success in the HIP 22460 system could reshape the financial markets considerably. »

The Empirical: « Ram Tah has published theoretical papers on the Guardian technology derived from the Proteus experiments. However, he admits that full comprehension of the superweapon's construction requires scientific data held exclusively by Salvation. »


* Azimuth Claims 'Thargoid Doomsday' Imminent
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon is now complete and final preparations are underway in the HIP 22460 system.

Commodore Morag Halloran, Azimuth Biotech's military coordinator, broadcast this announcement from the Bright Sentinel megaship:

« Salvation has confirmed that the Proteus Wave core mechanism is fully active. Calibration inside the Thargoid structure on the surface of HIP 22460 10b has successfully concluded. Power sources derived from Guardian designs are building to the required levels, and a final series of safety checks are currently underway. »

« Upon detonation, the energy pulse generated by the Proteus Wave will cause catastrophic disruption to all Thargoid biomechanical technology within range. Every alien vessel in HIP 22460 will immediately cease to function. Salvation predicts that the wide-ranging impact of the superweapon will drive all Thargoids out of the core systems. In practical terms, tomorrow will be their doomsday. »

« This is the culmination of years of research, coupled with Salvation's revolutionary technology. The project could not have been realised without the military support of the Alliance, Empire and Federation. Azimuth is also grateful to those pilots who delivered vital materials and risked their lives to hold back the Thargoid fleet. Take pride in the knowledge that your courage and dedication will help bring an end to the Second Thargoid War. »

The superpowers' anti-xeno taskforces have sent out urgent calls for emergency support to prevent Thargoid forces from attacking the Proteus Wave site in these critical final hours.


* Contact Lost after Proteus Wave Fired
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Communication with all ships in the HIP 22460 system has unexpectedly terminated, following the Proteus Wave's activation.

As intended, the energy pulse from Salvation's Guardian-based superweapon disabled all Thargoids in the system. This was followed by a second pulse of similar intensity from an undetermined source, which rendered the Bright Sentinel megaship powerless. The Thargoid vessels displayed signs of returning to life, after which all comms channels fell silent.

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have verified that they are no longer receiving signals from their capital ships. Azimuth Biotech has been unable to contact the Bright Sentinel or Heart of Taurus. There has been no word from Salvation or any Azimuth personnel within the system.

Some newsfeeds have begun publishing eyewitness reports from independent pilots, claiming that the Thargoids have resumed attacking all human ships. These statements have not been independently verified.

However, the superpowers are insisting on caution until the status of the Thargoid fleet can be ascertained. They have advised that non-military ships should avoid entering the HIP 22460 system until further notice.


* Thargoids Conquer HIP 22460
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Proteus Wave's failure has resulted in Thargoid forces overwhelming the coalition fleet in HIP 22460.

Independent and military observers have confirmed that although Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon was activated as scheduled, it had only a temporary effect on the Thargoids. Soon afterwards, human ships in the system found themselves without power following a second unknown energy pulse and were rapidly targeted by hostile Thargoid vessels.

Vox Galactica announced that the reporter Jade Sanderlyn was able to jettison her escape pod before her drifting craft was destroyed. She delivered this summary:

« It didn't work. The Proteus Wave didn't work. I saw its energies ripple out from the planet, I felt it, we all did. The Thargoids reeled and went dark, but only briefly. Then something else occurred, a noise which shook our bodies, screeching through our skulls. Something alien. »

« Suddenly all systems went down: engines, comms, everything. All the flashing beams of capital ship weapons fire disappeared. Every human ship in our vicinity went dead, leaving us floating through space. »

« I watched through the canopy as the Thargoids swarmed everywhere, more than I'd ever seen before. The Bright Sentinel was their first target, and they unleashed a blazing barrage against it. Nobody on board could have survived. »

The superpowers have announced that HIP 22460 is off-limits to civilian traffic, and should now be considered Thargoid territory. The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have each begun compiling official lists of every military ship deployed to the system which remains unaccounted for.

Azimuth Biotech likewise issued a statement confirming that both the Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus megaships have been destroyed, with all Proteus Wave project engineers missing and presumed dead. No information on the status of Salvation has yet been offered by the corporation.


* The Silent Aftermath
The Thargoid victory in the HIP 22460 system has raised many questions which neither Azimuth Biotech nor the superpowers have officially responded to.

Ernesto Rios, field correspondent for Vox Galactica, published a report summarising the latest developments:

« Two days have passed since the massacre in HIP 22460, which left many thousands dead. There have been no updates from the Alliance Defence Force or the Federal or Imperial navies. All press outlets have banned their journalists from entering the system, due to the extreme risk of Thargoid attack. We still lack specifics as to why the Proteus Wave failed. As the echoes of these horrific events fade, the authorities' silence is deafening. »

« Azimuth Biotech's surviving megaships, the Glorious Prospect and the Musashi, remain in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system alongside Sirius Corporation's vessel El Centinela Cadejo. These are accepting a steady trickle of survivors from HIP 22460, whose escape pods or ships survived long enough to regain power before the Thargoid onslaught reached them. Medical personnel have refused press access to medical bays, preventing interviews with eye-witnesses. »

« Without any formal statement from Azimuth, and with Salvation's status still unknown, we can only speculate on what happened in HIP 22460. The Thargoids' method of resisting the Proteus Wave's energy pulse remains unexplained, and their subsequent dominance of the system has caused widespread unease. Rather than ending the Second Thargoid War, Salvation may have escalated it to terrifying heights. »

Heimar Borichev, deputy editor of The Sovereign, also commented on the situation:

« Obviously this is a great tragedy, and we must honour those who lost their lives. But essentially, the Thargoids have just defended themselves from the xenocide we sought to inflict upon them. Can we really justify our moral outrage at this species, for protecting themselves against our weapon of mass destruction? Could all of this have been avoided? »


* Fleets Withdraw from Thargoid-Controlled System
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have confirmed that the remains of their anti-xeno taskforces have fully retreated from the HIP 22460 system.

Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori declared: « The Thargoids are now heavily entrenched in HIP 22460. Federal search and rescue teams are attempting to locate survivors, but our window of opportunity is closing as the enemy forces increase in number. »

A similar statement came from Senator Denton Patreus, who admitted « The aliens have successfully established a stronghold within human-occupied space. » The Imperial Navy has been instructed to prioritise evacuating its own ships and crew.

The Alliance Assembly and the Council of Admirals have been engaged in emergency discussions with representatives from Sirius Corporation. Early indications suggest a restructuring of anti-xeno operations is underway.

Across the core systems, public fears of a mass Thargoid invasion are running high. Planetary security forces are on alert, with every spacegoing military preparing for the possibility of fighting Thargoid vessels. Many public figures have expressed their concerns, including Aegis's former head of research Professor Alba Tesreau:

« I am utterly horrified by events in HIP 22460. Many of us feared that Azimuth's experiments would lead to catastrophe, but the widespread loss of life is still a sickening shock. Salvation critically underestimated the Thargoids' ability to adapt, a failure rooted in his perception of them as purely reactive creatures. »

« This tragedy is worsened by the fractured responses of the superpowers, which are reluctant to continue sharing information with external organisations. Without a dedicated research effort, we cannot analyse the Thargoid technology used in HIP 22460 or formulate a suitable defence. »


* Rumours Arise of New Alien Artefacts
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Anecdotal reports suggest that a previously unknown non-human object has been discovered by independent pilots.

No details about where or how the object was obtained have been established at this time. What little information exists has been provided by individual members of the Pilots' Federation.

One of these sources is a public message posted by Commander Marcus Mercer via an Interstellar Common Experience (ICE) network:

« I recently met up with an old friend of mine. Let's call her Digger. Years ago we'd team up to excavate Guardian and Thargoid artefacts. Sold them and split the profits. She mentioned having an 'unusual find' in her ship's cargo hold, and invited me onboard to check it out. »

« Standing there bathed in its light from the other side of the window, I knew this was something alien. But it wasn't just another dusty relic from millennia ago. This looked newer, alive and glowing, giving off a vibration that made me feel queasy. »

« Commander Kralone was the first to discover these objects, apparently. Digger said she'd worked out how to get hold of one and would tell me how \u2013 for a price. I joked that if Aegis was still around, it would have paid big credits for the thing. Digger suddenly stopped talking and gave me this look. Then she kicked me off her ship and was out of the docking bay before I'd even cleared the hangar! »

« I know that Digger spends a lot of her time investigating Thargoid stuff planet-side. So I'm going to visit a few and see what turns up. There's got to be more of those things out there, and if they end up being worth something, then I want my share. »


* Alliance-Sirius Pact Accelerated
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong-Rui have issued a joint statement regarding territorial defence against the Thargoids.

« The recent tragedy in HIP 22460 has underscored the crucial importance of the strategic defence pact. As the likelihood of increased Thargoid aggression rises, Allied systems can be assured that we are making rapid changes to withstand this potential threat. »

« Admiral Nikolas Glass will now coordinate all anti-xeno military operations. His first priority is to update the existing infrastructure of the Alliance Defence Force, allowing member system fleets to form according to mission parameters. This will bring greater flexibility and allow the ADF to direct forces to anywhere Thargoid incursions occur. »

« Allied worlds are calling out for greater defences, and the absence of a dedicated Alliance Navy has never been felt so keenly. But the Assembly is willing to approve greater military spending, and Sirius Corporation stands ready to put the defence pact into practice. »

In related news, the Council of Admirals officially verified that the Oath of Tyndareus was lost with all hands during the Thargoid counter-attack in the HIP 22460 system. The megaship's crew have been posthumously honoured in a public ceremony.


* Far God Cult Praises Alien Victory
A breakaway sect of the Thargoid-worshipping fringe religion is apparently celebrating the massacre of human forces in the HIP 22460 system.

A message was broadcast from the Testament megaship by the anonymous woman known only as the First Apostle of the True Chapters:

« We rejoice in the Far God's triumph! Those who tried to desecrate the dark angels have paid the price. The Far God is calling to us from the higher dimensions, and Its manifestation is closer than ever before. It is coming. »

There has been widespread outrage at Far God believers for their joyous reaction to the many thousands of deaths in HIP 22460. Some political and military leaders have even called for the 'alien-loving traitors' to be arrested as enemy agents. However, there is no evidence that they have any actual relationship with the Thargoid species other than idolisation.

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented:

« Despite its unusual belief system, and notwithstanding the poor taste of the First Apostle's remarks, we should support the evolution of the Far God cult toward a more structured framework. We must also remember that it is a lawful institution, and only establishes hive-chapels in systems with legislation that protects religious liberty. »

Authorities in several of those systems have stated that local Far God chapters are experiencing a surge in recruitment. Anecdotal reports suggest that these newest members are convinced the Second Thargoid War is already lost, and that humanity's extinction is as inevitable as the cult has always claimed.


* Mysteries of the Thargoids
Professor Ishmael Palin, the foremost authority on the Thargoids, has authored a short article for the scientific journal The Empirical.

« Recent events have once again brought a focus on the alien species we call Thargoids. I have witnessed governments, militaries and public figures characterise them as a mindless destructive force, akin to a swarm of locusts. I feel it is important to underscore how much is absent from our understanding. »

« Despite many decades of research, the Thargoid civilisation remains totally alien. We still have almost no true understanding of their language, society, culture or objectives. Non-violent interactions with their spacecraft in recent years have provided little insight, other than their commitment to patrolling and harvesting meta-alloy sources. Of course, their willingness to fight is one of the few traits we definitely share. »

« As yet we have almost no knowledge of their hierarchy, beyond broad assumptions that they follow the functional roles of known insect species. Due to the biomechanical nature of their constructs, we are even uncertain about the dividing line between individual beings and their vessels. If living Thargoids have ever been studied, as is rumoured, then it is by clandestine means, concealed from the scientific community. »

« While Thargoids frequently drag ships out of hyperspace to be scanned, not all of these incidents result in an attack. Their hostile reaction to Guardian artefacts may be something like a genetic memory, hard-coded into their technologies. Even the Thargoids' perception of time could be very different to ours. What we think of as an ancient war might be recent or ongoing from their viewpoint. »

« However, in HIP 22460 we witnessed something new: an active countermeasure to the Proteus Wave. This suggests that their perception of humanity has changed. We are no longer troublesome scavengers claiming the scraps left behind by higher life forms. Instead, we have sought to decimate their numbers again, just as with the Mycoid virus centuries ago. I believe we now have the Thargoids' full attention. »

« Our future relationship with the Thargoids is uncertain. But I'm keen to offer the reminder that we are dealing with a species of enormous intelligence and complexity, not a horde of voracious animals. We must strive to learn more about them, and hope they have the capacity to view us as something other than an enemy. »


* Palin and Ram Tah Seek Unclassified Relics
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Two engineers who specialise in studying alien technology have requested deliveries of a newly discovered artefact.

Professor Ishmael Palin explained the details:

« These 'unclassified relics' \u2013 as they are currently known \u2013 are Guardian in origin. Traditionally such artefacts trigger a hostile reaction from any Thargoid technology introduced to it. But our preliminary studies show a molecular realignment of the artefact's crystalline structure, resulting in something that emits both Guardian and Thargoid energy signatures. »

« This came to my attention only recently, unusual electromagnetic fields appeared on my sensors as CMDR Hurix approached Abel Laboratory while carrying one of these objects. I am now offering reimbursement to any pilots who can provide more relics for further study. »

Ram Tah provided a similar statement:

« This is an exciting development in the field of xenological research. For the very first time, Guardian and Thargoid systems have interacted to synthesise a new material. Initial data suggests this is now a consistent process whenever a Guardian relic interfaces with a Thargoid surface site. The first relic I saw was gratefully received from CMDR Demlagor's team several days ago. »

« What is their purpose? Have we accidentally unlocked some transformative function that was always present? Or have the Thargoids reconsidered their technological adaptation in response to recent events in the HIP 22460 system? With the help of contributing pilots, my shared research project with Professor Palin may furnish us with answers. »

Unclassified relics can be delivered to Professor Palin at Abel Laboratory in the Arque system, or to Ram Tah at Phoenix Base in the Meene system.


* A Day of Remembrance for HIP 22460
President Zachary Hudson has announced that today is a Federal day of remembrance for those lost in HIP 22460 on August 9th.

In a public address, the president formally acknowledged the recent tragedy:

« The Battle of HIP 22460 is a dark day in our interstellar nation's history. The crews of the FNS Bombardier, FNS Fortitude and FNS Varian Scott gave their lives with dignity and honour, as did many other courageous individuals. They will never be forgotten for as long as the Federation endures. »

« We recognise this massacre of defenceless crew for what it was: the latest example of unrelenting hostility by our Thargoid enemy. Another event which leads me to believe no peace can be brokered with that species. I promise, under no uncertain terms, that the loss of over fifty thousand naval personnel will be avenged. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters provided a statement to The Federal Times:

« I wholeheartedly support the creation of this day of remembrance. But we are not entirely blameless in causing the disaster. If not for an ill-considered commitment of Federal Navy resources to Salvation's banner, this misguided project might never have been realised. »

« I might add that President Hudson fails to explain precisely how we will enact revenge upon the Thargoids. Now that we appear to lack further superweapon technology, our conventional forces will be severely challenged if the conflict escalates. »


* 'Thargoid Roar' Claim Draws Speculation
An independent journalist has suggested that some survivors of the Battle of HIP 22460 heard a strange alien sound of unknown origin.

Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse published his theories via the Rewired network:

« Only a handful of crewmembers rescued from HIP 22460 managed to give garbled first-hand accounts before being placed under military quarantine. Naturally, most talked about how those damn bugs wiped out almost everyone. But a few mentioned something bizarre heard shortly after the Thargoid counter-attack. »

« These witnesses described it in various ways: 'ghastly', 'overwhelming', 'monstrous' to name a few. Jade Sanderlyn, Vox Galactica's hotshot reporter, said it was 'a noise which shook our bodies, screeching through our skulls'. Now, there are no audio recordings in the public domain to share, but there's definitely a pattern if you study the reports closely. »

« Both ship and suit audio systems interpret all sorts of electromagnetic emissions from Thargoid vessels. This would have to be a far more powerful cry to cut through the chaos across multiple ships. Could it have been a roar of defiance, aimed at us? Or was it aimed somewhere else? »

« And before anyone accuses me of stirring up trouble like usual: no, I haven't technically heard the alleged sound myself. Full disclosure. But someone has to speak up for those who insist it happened. I wasn't in HIP 22460 and neither were most of you. Got it? »

« Here's where it gets interesting, though. The Federal Navy responded to my request for details by stating all HIP 22460 data was classified. The Imperial Navy refused to acknowledge me at all. The Alliance Defence Force said it was 'likely a symptom of collective trauma or hysteria'. So the obvious question is: what are they all hiding? »

« Congressional hopeful Dalton Chase, governor of Andavandul 1, is one of the few people in a position of stellar authority talking openly about HIP 22460. Chase recently argued that people have a right to know everything that happened. Other broadcasters like Heimar Borichev, Kit Fowler and Joy Senne are also not accepting the silence. We'll continue demanding answers from those who are supposedly protecting us. »


* Report from HIP 22460: 'Salvation is Dead'
It has been confirmed that Salvation, figurehead of Azimuth Biotech and creator of the Proteus Wave, was killed on board the Bright Sentinel.

A segment of a transmission by an independent rescue team within HIP 22460 was shared with Vox Galactica by an anonymous source. The team was reporting back to the Musashi megaship, which has now returned to the T Tauri system.

« Captain Qadir, this is Drummond. You're not paying us well enough to be in this hellhole. There are Thargoids everywhere we turn. But we've found out what you wanted to know. It's not good news. »

« We finally managed to get close to the wreck of the Bright Sentinel, near where the bridge used to be. Bodies were drifting among the twisted metal, but fewer than we expected. We identified some of the command crew, including Commodore Halloran. But even before we got a positive ID scan, I recognised Dr Wycherley immediately. Nobody else could possibly look so old. »

« He was still in his command chair, surrounded by shattered fragments of cybernetic implants, his portable medical sensors dormant. Despite his shredded and broken body, his eyes were frozen open. I reached out to close them, but a Thargoid interceptor suddenly warped in and we had to race back to our ship. »

« I'm uploading all our data now, but I'm sorry to report that our primary target was not recoverable. Salvation is dead. »

Azimuth Biotech has confirmed that it employed freelance specialists to locate any surviving personnel from the Proteus Wave project, and that their findings were believed to be accurate. No further statement has yet been made.


* Megaship Materials Boost Alliance Defence Force
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Sirius Corporation has gathered resources in the Leesti system to help improve the Alliance's anti-xeno defences.

The campaign's conclusion was announced by Captain Delfina Dominguez, commanding officer of the Chariot of Rhea megaship:

« Many pilots docked with us over the past week to deliver shipments of energy grid assemblies, magnetic emitter coils, power transfer buses and titanium. On behalf of Sirius Corporation and the Allied Defence Force, I thank you for such encouraging support. »

« I am informed that these will be sufficient to outfit 2 sentry megaships, each armed with experimental AX weaponry. These will be placed in key systems across the Alliance, ready to respond to potential Thargoid incursions. »

« Admiral Glass has outlined his long-term plans to senior officers in the Sirius Navy. It's clear that these are exciting times for the Alliance Defence Force. If the Thargoids come, we will be better prepared to repel them. »

The Council of Admirals has stated that the new megaships are expected to become operational by September 15th.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect payment from the Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system.


* Retrial Requested for Admiral Tanner
The Federal Attorney's Office has called for the conviction of former admiral Aden Tanner to be reviewed in light of events in HIP 22460.

Following a distinguished career in the Federal Navy, Tanner served as the chief military liaison for Aegis. In November 3307, while in command of the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi, he attempted to take control of Hind Mine starport. He believed it held evidence that Salvation intentionally attracted the Thargoids to the Cornsar system in order to test his superweapon.

Tanner's attack failed and the Musashi was overtaken, largely due to superior numbers of independent pilots supporting the former Taurus Mining Ventures, now Azimuth Biotech. He was court martialled, dishonourably discharged, and found guilty of mutiny and unlawful military action. But his sentencing was postponed by request of Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who considered Tanner's intel to be crucial to his own investigation into Salvation.

The Federal Times published this statement from Senior Attorney Fiona Logan:

« It is now a proven fact that the Guardian-based nature of the Proteus Wave was intended to attract the Thargoid fleet to HIP 22460. Component analysis by Ram Tah has verified that its forerunner superweapons were almost certainly designed to do likewise. »

« This substantiates Tanner's allegation that Salvation deliberately invited Thargoid incursions in inhabited systems. Furthermore, Salvation originally claimed that his anti-xeno detection network alerted him to the aliens' approach, but there is no evidence that this network exists. »

The Federal Navy Criminal Court confirmed that a formal application for a judiciary review was received. A special panel has been convened to reassess Tanner's case.


* Fears Rise of Thargoid Expansion
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Ships travelling in the vicinity of HIP 22460 have reported so-called 'hyperdiction' incidents at increased distances from the Thargoid-controlled system.

Pilots have filed similar reports about encounters in V0402 Aurigae, HR 1490, Synuefe SA-C b33-2 and several other systems. The number of ships being pulled from hyperspace and scanned by Thargoid vessels \u2013 or in some cases attacked immediately - has substantially increased.

Admiral Maxton Price issued a statement on behalf of the Federal Navy:

« Our initial analysis suggested that, having eliminated the Proteus Wave, the Thargoids would extend their forces out from the HIP 22460 system. Unfortunately, those predictions have proved correct. New data indicates that they are using that system as a base of operations to expand into the sector. »

« Historically, hyperdiction events did not always result in conflict. But the recent spate of direct attacks proves that the Thargoids' aggression toward humanity has reached new levels. All civilian traffic should exercise extreme caution while travelling within the Pleiades region. »

Professor Alba Tesreau published an alternative viewpoint:

« What we interpret as a military expansion may instead be an attempt to reclaim territory. The Pleiades Nebula has long had a considerable Thargoid presence, with many planets containing barnacle sites where their vessels harvest meta-alloys. It seems logical that they would use their increased numbers in HIP 22460 to reassert their claim on the region. »


* A New Chapter for Azimuth
Azimuth Biotech has outlined plans for the corporation's future following the confirmation of Salvation's death.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, submitted a statement to public newsfeeds:

« The loss of Salvation, formerly known as Caleb Wycherley, is a sad day for our organisation. We will remember his sacrifice on humanity's behalf, but recognise this as a chance to forge a fresh path towards the future. »

« Azimuth Biotech is now under new management, with myself as its acting CEO. We have lost a great deal of expertise and personnel, but our decades of xenological research will serve a vital purpose in the war against the Thargoids. »

« Unfortunately, due to a misguided campaign by radicalised saboteurs, many of our official facilities have been illegally snatched from our control. Yet plans are already underway to rebuild our corporate infrastructure. Of our surviving megaships, the Musashi has returned to our headquarters in the T Tauri system, while the Glorious Prospect has jumped to the LHS 157 system to establish a resource-gathering initiative. »

« I can assure our former clients in the Alliance, Empire and Federation that Azimuth Biotech is beginning a new chapter in its long and successful history. »


* Supply Mined Materials to Azimuth Biotech
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has called on mining vessels to deliver raw materials to the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 157 system.

The campaign was launched by the corporation's acting CEO, Torben Rademaker:

« Our mission to continue developing anti-xeno technologies is currently hampered by a lack of resources to establish new facilities. Azimuth's investment in the Proteus Wave project and related infrastructure was considerable. Meanwhile, the reckless actions of anarchists and political extremists have inhibited our recovery. »

« Generous credit payments are being offered for supplies of the following mined metals: cobalt, gallite and osmium. These can be delivered to the Glorious Prospect in the LHS 157 system. »

« With a suitably reinforced corporate infrastructure, Azimuth can regain its status as the premier organisation for xenological research in the core systems. Dedicated supporters will be granted access to the Mbooni system, should they not already have it. »

In recent weeks, Azimuth Biotech was forced to withdraw from the Maia, Merope and Qarato systems following a coordinated campaign by an organised group opposing Salvation. Currently the corporation maintains a single facility in Mbooni as well as Hind Mine starport in the T Tauri system.


* Empire Shifts Anti-Xeno Strategy
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has made a public announcement for the first time since the Battle of HIP 22460.

In an address before the Senate, which was broadcast on all Imperial networks, she stated:

« Our endeavour in the HIP 22460 system was a noble one, born from our duty to defend Imperial citizens against the Thargoid threat. We honour the crews of the INV Audacious Dream, INV Illustrious Fortune and INV Paramount, as well as other auxiliaries and volunteers who fought against overwhelming odds. Their names will be remembered. »

« The disastrous outcome from the so-called coalition provides direction for our future. It is clear to me that the Empire must learn to trust its own military strength once again. Joint operations with the Alliance and Federation, and our reliance upon Salvation's superweapon, were strategic errors that we cannot afford to repeat. »

« Henceforth, all inter-superpower projects will cease. I have commanded the Imperial Navy to focus exclusively on protecting the Empire's borders against our enemies, regardless of their origin. Resources and finances allocated to external suppliers will be redirected internally, to corporations of Imperial origin. Our scientists and manufacturers will provide the means to shield our territory against Thargoid invasion. »

« To the people of the Empire: be assured that your safety is my highest priority. As your Emperor, I vow that we will endure as the strongest civilisation in history. »


* Remarkable 'Lost Planet' Rediscovered
The location of the first green gas giant ever recorded was a mystery for years, but it has now been found by a community of explorers.

Commander Kelly Eldridge initially made the discovery on the 23rd of May 3301, noting that it was « the strangest gas giant I've seen so far ». The vivid green bands in the planet's atmosphere made it unique to explorers at the time, and these types of gas giant are still extremely rare. The unusual colouration is believed to be caused by free-floating radioplankton that absorb planetary radiation.

Unfortunately, astrographic data of the system was not retained by Eldridge, so its precise location was lost. But in early 3308, Commander Richard Fluiraniz M began gathering enthusiasts for the 'At The Eldritch Gate' expedition, to collectively search for the missing planet.

The mission involved analysing constellation patterns and interstellar gas clouds in the only available image taken by Eldridge. Pilots also retraced her path by tracking neutron stars with her discovery tag, which involved multiple ships sweeping across an enormous area within the Perseus Crags region.

A match for the green gas giant was eventually made on the 16th of August by Commander Orange!, who identified it as the seventh planet in the Shaulai DL-P d5-274 system. With the system name supplied, Universal Cartographics then verified that it was indeed the original submitted by Eldridge.

Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics, gave a public tribute to the expedition:

« For over seven years, astronomers have been unable to officially catalogue the very first green gas giant. Through hard work and perseverance it has finally been found, and the full story of Shaulai DL-P d5-274 7 can be recorded for posterity. We are indebted to the Independent Explorers Association and everyone who took part in this historic achievement. »


* Unexplained 'Flare' Detected in Deep Space
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Reports from independent explorers indicate that an unusual visual phenomenon has appeared in deep space.

A distant point of light, described as a reddish-orange flare with faint radial patterns, has been observed close to the Barnard's Loop nebula. It is thought to have appeared only recently. Universal Cartographics has confirmed that the location of this 'flare' does not match any previously catalogued stellar body or star.

Early attempts to verify these reports have noted a strange response when the same region of space is observed through a full spectrum system scanner (FSS). No definitive target can be isolated, but claims of a faint background noise generated by FSS audio converters have been asserted.

Commander Eva Llewellyn, speaking to Vox Galactica, remarked:

« I'm used to the FSS making all sorts of strange noises, but listening to this thing \u2013 comet, solar flare, whatever it is \u2013 gives me goosebumps. Something feels off, all right. The scanner tells me there's nothing there, nothing to focus on. Can't say I agree. Still, smarter people than me will figure out the truth of it all, I guess. »

At present, it is unknown if this is a naturally occurring stellar event. Pilots are attempting to gather more data, but as yet no authority or scientific body has provided any official analysis of the phenomenon.


* Experts Speculate on Thargoid Behaviour
The Thargoids' resistance to the Proteus Wave in HIP 22460 has prompted discussion among academics in the field of xenology.

Professor Shamus Madigan of Olympus Village University published a paper in the scientific journal The Empirical, which included this extract:

« The Thargoids newly observed defence against a man-made superweapon, and their subsequent aggression, suggests a direct response to our tactics. Not only have they upgraded their technology, but also their behaviour has altered. Humanity is now a problem that must be dealt with. »

The Imperial Science Academy's director of xenological studies, Ivano Colombera, responded to a press query with:

« My hypothesis is that the Thargoids' ability to disrupt Guardian technology was first conceived millions of years ago during the Guardian/Thargoid conflict, and only now have they sought to redeploy it against our hybrid modules. Nevertheless, my division has been ordered to focus on developing practical countermeasures. »

Dr Jeong-Hui Shin, a senior member of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, outlined her viewpoint via the Rewired network:

« We should not assume that the Thargoids have consciously adapted to us, or even register us as an intelligent life-form. We may be no more than parasites to them. Perhaps their vessels are responding like biomechanical 'antibodies', automatically fighting against a particularly virulent strain of human infection in HIP 22460. »


* 'Xeno-Peace' Discussions Gain Momentum
Public debate around the Battle of HIP 22460 has seen the emergence of a grassroots movement that promotes communication with the Thargoids.

As militaries prepare for a protracted anti-xeno conflict, this alternative viewpoint has gained traction on social channels in multiple systems. Proponents believe that their governments should focus on finding ways to open a dialogue with the Thargoid species, and end hostilities using diplomatic means.

On Interstellar Communal Experience (ICE) platforms, some influential names have amplified the xeno-peace concept. In a recent ICE-cast, leading caster Joy Senne openly discussed the topic with her viewers:

« How do you end a war? Is it by fighting harder, building bigger weapons, wiping out everyone you can? No! Well, sometimes, I guess. But I guess Salvation blew that one, right? We shouldn't just accept what our leaders are telling us \u2013 that the only way to end the Thargoid war is through military action. »

« So if you want peace, you learn to talk to the other side and find common ground. That's why I'm fascinated by this Thargoid Advocacy Project, which is promoting ways to resolve this terrible situation through non-violent means. Millions of people have already signed up. What do you all think? »

The movement has received minor coverage in most newsfeeds. However, The Sovereign, which reports on events in independent systems, has dedicated several segments to the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Deputy editor Heimar Borichev regularly discusses the topic in his editorials:

« Pro-peacers are being ridiculed for wanting to talk to the aliens rather than shoot them. The experts claim it's a waste of research trying to communicate with Thargoids. But better facts are out there. Listen to what Professor Tesreau has always said between the lines. Seek out theories that weren't approved by your governments. Make up your own mind. »

In the Federation, a spokesperson for the Proactive Detection Bureau remarked:

« An increase in pro-xeno sentiment has been flagged by our algorithms, since such messages often include markers for potentially antisocial behaviour. There is currently no evidence that this is anything other than a countercultural social phenomenon, but our operatives are monitoring the situation. »


* Mahon Rebukes Imperial Isolationism
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has spoken out against Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's decree to suspend inter-superpower cooperation.

At a meeting of the Alliance Assembly, Mahon said:

« This hasty decision from Emperor Arissa will have dangerous repercussions for the core systems as a whole, not just those within the Empire. Now that the Thargoids have become more hostile than ever before, humanity should be uniting against this common enemy. »

« Let us not forget: the coalition of anti-xeno taskforces in HIP 22460 performed their duties admirably, despite the tragic conclusion. That degree of military coordination could and should be sustained, to a far broader scale. »

« The Sirius Treaty, which I proposed at the Galactic Summit in 3307, would have established anti-xeno operations as a cross-superpower priority. I can only imagine how much better prepared we would now be to combat the Thargoids. But there is still scope for governments and organisations to work more closely, as exemplified by our strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation. »

The Alliance, Federation and Marlinist Colonies have reported that the Empire is methodically closing down all collaborative projects. However, official diplomatic representation in non-Imperial territories has been maintained.


* Successful Mining Campaign Sustains Azimuth
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A range of mined materials have been delivered to the LHS 157 system to help Azimuth Biotech create new facilities.

Captain Maxim Lagunov, in command of the Glorious Prospect megaship, announced:

« This is the second time in recent weeks that our cargo bays have been stocked with vital supplies to sustain Azimuth's future. These shipments of cobalt, gallite and osmium will be distributed to our manufacturing teams, and we hope to construct new permanent facilities in good time. »

« Torben Rademaker has authorised us to release funds to all pilots who mined and delivered these materials. This initiative has played a major role in helping to rebuild the corporation and continue our important work. »

« The Glorious Prospect will remain in the LHS 157 system for now. Pilots who have contributed to this initiative will shortly receive a Mbooni system permit, providing individual contribution targets were met. »

With the destruction of the Bright Sentinel, the Prospect's Deep outpost in Mbooni is currently the only supplier of Salvation's pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannon, Guardian plasma charger and Guardian shard cannon.


* Thargoids Turn Attention to Inhabited Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Swarms of Thargoid vessels have invaded the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems in an apparently coordinated attack.

Vox Galactica published this report by field correspondent Ernesto Rios:

« Since the Thargoids conquered HIP 22460 a month ago, their presence has gradually expanded in all directions. But these are the first inhabited systems to be invaded since the Proteus Wave incident, threatening a combined population of over seven million people. »

« The governing factions of these systems \u2013 Sirius Inc, SI Terraforming and Tekkeitjal Public Corporation, respectively \u2013 are expected to host defensive operations against the Thargoids. None are aligned to any superpower, and so have no formal navy to support these efforts. »

« As yet, none of the starports in 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit or Tekkeitjal have been directly attacked. Civilians have been instructed to remain calm but many are evacuating, fearful of the stations suffering caustic enzyme bombardment. »

« This is a notable difference from previous Thargoid incursions, and has led some military figures to theorise on the alien's new strategic objectives. »

Defensive operations are being orchestrated from the starports Bennington's Rest, Samuda Terminal and Riemann Colony. Thargoid combat bonds can be handed in at these locations for increased credit rewards.


* Federation Monitors Pro-Xeno Activity
The Federal Intelligence Agency has warned of heightened interest in the Far God cult and groups considered sympathetic to the Thargoids.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the Proactive Detection Bureau, delivered a public statement:

« We have confirmed a significant increase in communications between local chapters of the Far God religious order, which includes the sharing of unverified xenological data. The Thargoids' victory in HIP 22460 seems to have caused unprecedented excitement among the cultists. At present, there is no evidence that they pose any danger to the public. However, we are concerned by a recent increase in citizens abandoning their conventional lifestyles to join the cult. »

« We have also noted the rising popularity of a civil movement that advocates diplomatic relations with the Thargoids. This rhetoric is being promoted by several high-profile media figures. There is currently no known connection between these 'xeno-peace' supporters and the Far God cult, but both groups are being closely observed for potential criminality. »

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, the leading academic authority on the Far God faith, submitted his observations to The Federal Times:

« Recent events in HIP 22460 have galvanised the cultists, but also seem to have triggered an element of discord among some. Worshippers are abandoning the orthodox hive-chapels and pledging themselves to the True Chapters sect, where the First Apostle is being hailed as a holy messenger of the Far God. My contacts inform me that the Testament megaship has despatched scouts to locate a more permanent home, likely to accommodate a wave of new converts. »


* Patreus Highlights Thargoid Tactics
Senator Denton Patreus, fleet admiral of the Imperial Navy, has discussed the Empire's new priorities following the Battle of HIP 22460.

During an exclusive interview with the Eye on Achenar newsfeed, Patreus said:

« Her Majesty the Emperor has decreed that our military priority is to defend systems within the Empire. The Imperial Navy's production and training facilities have increased their efforts to redress the loss of three Majestic-class interdictors, along with tens of thousands of naval crew. »

« I've conducted my own tactical analysis of what took place in the HIP 22460 system. Salvation's interest in the area with historic Thargoid ruins was no coincidence, I feel. He was something of a showman, and planning a final victory in the aliens' own territory fits what we know of his ambition. »

« The Thargoids attacked human fleets with ferocious intent, but the fact they never assaulted the Proteus Wave site strikes me as remarkable. Even when considering the stout resistance, we offered. There is saying among military strategists: Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. »

« In hindsight, it seems possible that the Thargoids allowed the Proteus Wave to be installed at their surface site, with the foreknowledge that they could turn the superweapon against us. Perhaps Salvation unknowingly constructed his own execution chamber. »

« I'm convinced that we face an alien intelligence with a strategic competence to match any human opponent. The Empire cannot underestimate this enemy ever again. »


* Xeno-Peace Activists: 'We Are The Invaders'
The xeno-peace movement, which calls for communication with the Thargoids, has sought to rationalise the latest incursions.

Despite ongoing conflicts in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems, Thargoid aggression has been attributed to defensive measures. Reports by journalists in those systems, which have focused on the increasingly aggressive Thargoid craft, have been labelled 'propaganda' endorsed by major media corporations.

The 'Thargoid Advocacy Project' - a label which many supporters of the movement use in calls to action - believes that the authorities must commit to establishing a dialogue with the aliens. Timothy Culver, a prominent activist for the xeno-peace cause, provided a statement to The Sovereign:

« The Thargoids did not invade our space. We invaded theirs. Entire nebulas and other regions have been inhabited by them for over a million years, but our leaders arrogantly assume these regions are human conquests. Thargoid defensive acts were countered by destroying countless numbers of their vessels, stealing their meta-alloy resources, and a recent attempt to inflict widespread slaughter upon their fleet. »

« These latest incidents are reprisals for the Proteus Wave, a weapon of mass destruction built within one of the Thargoids' own surface sites. This was the second such attempt to massacre vast numbers of Thargoids, the first being the mycoid bioweapon used less than two centuries ago. Such acts of revenge are common in humanity's own military past. »

« The Thargoids are responding via the only language our leaders understand: warfare. It's time that we spoke a new language. Let's start talking to our neighbours instead of aiming our weapons at them. »


* 'Thargoid Roar' Leaked to Public
Classified audio-visual footage from the Battle of HIP 22460 has been anonymously submitted to several mainstream newsfeeds.

The Alliance Tribune, The Federal Times, The Imperial Herald, The Sovereign and Vox Galactica all received databanks salvaged from various wreckages in the HIP 22460 system. Most were obtained from naval vessels, along with a handful recovered from independent ship's logs.

Superpower-based newsfeeds elected not to publish any information related to their own militaries, citing security guidelines. But enough material has reached the public domain to portray the sequence of events of August 9th: the activation of the Proteus Wave, the Thargoid counter-attack, and the subsequent destruction of huge numbers of ships.

These files include audio recordings of a broadcast of unknown origin that occurred throughout HIP 22460. They match previously unverified descriptions of a so-called 'Thargoid roar', something that has been discussed by independent journalist Flint Lafosse and Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn.

Several interpretations of this unearthly sound have been offered. Professor Shamus Madigan believed it to be « residual electromagnetic radiation from the Thargoids' energy pulse on HIP 22460 10b ». Dr Jeong-Hui Shin theorised that it was « a burst of frenzied communication to \u2013 or from \u2013 some distant location ». Meanwhile, the First Apostle of the True Chapters claimed: « The voice of the Far God calls to the faithful. The manifestation has begun. »

Coupled with the Thargoid expansion from HIP 22460 and their recent invasion of three inhabited systems, this new revelation has fuelled public anxiety over the Thargoid threat. Members of the Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have reassured their citizens that there is no need for panic. It is believed that several intelligence agencies have opened investigations into the source of the leak, the content of which is believed to have been classified by military departments.

Anti-Thargoid operations are continuing in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems. The Federation has submitted several Farragut-class battle cruisers to help repel Thargoid forces. Local factions organising the defensive efforts have called for independent pilots to join the fight.


* The Judgement of Admiral Tanner
A special tribunal of the Federal Navy Criminal Court has deliberated the case of former admiral Aden Tanner and made a final decision.

The following press release was released to all Federal newsfeeds:

« This tribunal has scrutinised the latest evidence supplied by the Federal Attorney's Office. We find that the analysis of Salvation's superweapons does indeed substantiate Mr Tanner's allegation that they were designed to provoke a hostile response from the Thargoids. Azimuth Biotech has been unable to verify that its claimed 'anti-xeno detection network' exists, explaining that most of Salvation's advanced designs were not widely shared within the corporation. »

« Nevertheless, regardless of motive or moral justification, Mr Tanner directly disobeyed orders when the Musashi staged an assault on Hind Mine in the T Tauri system. It is therefore our judgement that the court martial verdict on the 12th of January stands. The request for a retrial has been denied. Having been convicted of mutiny and unlawful military action, he remains dishonourably discharged and has been stripped of his rank and honours. »

« We do acknowledge the ethical argument that the Proteus Wave would not have been constructed, and many lives may have been saved, if the Musashi had gained access to Hind Mine starport. In light of this context to the case, Mr Tanner's sentence has been commuted to time served, and he is free to leave Federal custody. However, he is permanently barred from entering civil or military service. »


* Far God Cult Under Federal Scrutiny
The Order of the Far God is facing an official investigation and increased public maltreatment within the Federation.

Freelance journalist Alexei Keel published a special report via Vox Galactica:

« The Thargoid-worshipping cult has always been a controversial faith on Federal worlds. But it is currently causing a civil backlash of the sort not seen since 3304. »

« A recent expos\u00e9 by the Federal Free Press proves that naval intelligence operatives are investigating all chapters of the cult established in Federal space. Allegedly, there are suspicions that cultists may be undertaking acts of espionage to sabotage anti-xeno operations. »

« As more details of the Battle of HIP 22460 become public knowledge, the pacifistic cultists have become an easy target for ordinary people seeking some kind of revenge against overtly pro-Thargoid ideologies. Although security forces claim to be responding to these vigilante attacks, widespread prejudice means that local police rarely act when such crimes are reported. »

Antipathy to the religion has increased to the point where prominent figures in the Federal government are calling for it be outlawed. As Secretary of State Lana Berkovich put it: « Humanity is at war with the Thargoids. To allow an army of crazed alien sympathisers within our society is to invite disaster. »

All of this has driven thousands of worshippers to abandon their hive-chapels and join the more radical True Chapters sect. Welcoming the new converts, the First Apostle proclaimed: « We must defend our faith and ourselves, so we may witness the Far God's manifestation with our own eyes. »

The exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov has remarked on this as « a fundamental shift from the fatalism of their conventional beliefs ». Keel raises the question in his report: what happens if Far God cultists stop tolerating these hostile acts and start fighting for survival?


* Aisling Criticises Imperial Policy
Princess Aisling Duval has challenged the Empire's shift in priority towards reduced interaction with other superpowers.

During an interview with the Citizens' Chronicle newsfeed, she remarked:

« It's obvious that the Imperial Navy is deeply embarrassed by its commitment to Salvation, and is as good as paralyzed without his superweapon technology. The Emperor is now attempting to save face by severing all collaborative projects with the Alliance and Federation. Frankly, I think this is short-sighted and self-defeating. »

« Our naval crews in HIP 22460 died as heroes, of course, but we should not ignore that they were acting in coalition with Allied and Federal taskforces. This tragedy affected all of us, and we do not honour the dead by pretending otherwise. All of us with the ability to help, no matter our allegiance, must do more to support the families of everyone lost in that appalling catastrophe, while recognising the likelihood of further casualties of war. »

Hadrian Augustus Duval publicly disagreed with his cousin's viewpoint, as quoted by Paresa News Network:

« Despite my respect for Princess Aisling, I must admit that Emperor Arissa has my support in this matter \u2013 something I never believed I would ever say. My position has always been that our Empire is weakened by relying on external forces of any kind. So it's gratifying to see the wisdom of this policy finally being acknowledged. »


* Demands for Azimuth to Face Justice
There are widespread calls to bring criminal charges against Azimuth Biotech for its role in the massacre in the HIP 22460 system.

Rhiannon Grady, director of the civil rights organisation Advocacy, told the media:

« Azimuth Biotech planned the operation in HIP 22460, with the Proteus Wave's failure leading directly to the slaughter of well over a hundred thousand naval personnel and combat pilots by Thargoids. Salvation's death does not absolve his corporation of its culpability. We believe that charges of wilful endangerment and accessory to mass murder should be made, and those responsible be should be brought before a court of law. »

Other citizens' groups have made similar claims, with some calling for the superpowers' leaders to resign or stand trial for supporting Salvation. These demands were given legal weight by a recent ruling from the Federal Navy Criminal Court in the case of Aden Tanner, which acknowledged that preventing the construction of the Proteus Wave may have saved many lives.

Torben Rademaker, acting CEO of Azimuth Biotech, gave this statement in response:

« Media outlets and uninformed laymen often refer to the 'failure' of the Proteus Wave. The truth is that it worked precisely as intended, by shutting down all Thargoid vessels in HIP 22460. Unfortunately, Dr Wycherley did not anticipate that the aliens had developed a technology to recalibrate his superweapon to affect human ships. »

« I must make this clear: one man's regrettable miscalculation does not reflect on Azimuth Biotech as a whole. Our organisation has pioneered xenological research for decades, and we have many dedicated experts in different fields. We must accept that weapons development comes with risks. But there is no such thing as failure in scientific endeavour. »


* Aisling Requests Rare Items to Fund Charity
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A fundraiser hosted by Princess Aisling aims to finance a support network for Imperial citizens affected by Thargoid aggression.

The Citizens' Relief Trust has been established in the Cemiess system, prompted by the loss of thousands of military personnel during the Battle of HIP 22460. She announced:

« While the Empire is focused on increasing its military strength, we must not forget the human cost of ongoing conflict with the Thargoids. Those who died in battle will be honoured by assisting the families and dependants left to mourn them. The Citizens' Relief Trust plans to establish support centres to ensure their financial and emotional needs are met. »

« To raise funding, I have requested deliveries of Eshu Umbrellas, Xihe Biomorphic Companions and Chateau De Aegaeon. These luxury commodities will be auctioned or sold at a special gala I plan to host for Imperial nobility, with all proceeds used to establish this network. Wine and fish is also requested to serve to our distinguished guests. »

« Although we cannot help those bereaved families who live beyond the Empire's borders, I hope that the Citizens' Relief Trust inspires the creation of similar charities elsewhere. »

Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to Mackenzie Relay starport in the Cemiess system, with planned rewards including luxury vessel paint jobs. At special request from Princess Aisling, Lavigny's Legion has been tasked with accepting shipments and protecting those who are transporting these valuable cargos. Combat bonds will be reimbursed for all wanted ships that are destroyed in the system.


* Alliance-Sirius Pact Prepares New Taskforce
The anti-xeno strategic defence pact between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation has been fully ratified as a legally binding treaty.

The Assembly voted to approve the agreement at the end of June, following months of debate. The decision was influenced by the outcome of two competing initiatives to procure resource packages for the Alliance Defence Force (ADF).

Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Council of Admirals, delivered this statement:

« Now that the legalities have been addressed, a demonstration of the defence pact's potential is long overdue. I am very pleased to announce that a new anti-xeno taskforce is being assembled under the name Operation Tyndareus, in honour of the megaship lost in HIP 22460. »

« A tactical combination of ADF ships and Sirius Corporation's resources will deliver a devastating counterstrike at the next opportunity. This will demonstrate that our unified forces can repel Thargoid attackers and defend Allied space. »

Shortly before this announcement, an editorial in the Old Worlds Gazette remarked: « So far, Sirius has not fired a single shot in this war. Do they plan to save us by offering the Thargoids special discounts? » Other critics agreed that the defence pact looked increasingly like an administrative exercise rather than a military strategy.

Councillor Hildegard Dressler, who represents the Leesti system, told The Alliance Tribune:

« I know that the prime minister shares the public's frustration with the slow process of bureaucratic approval. He has called upon Sirius Corporation to fast-track its plans urgently, and Operation Tyndareus will be the result. »


* Deep Space 'Anomalies' Generate Discussion
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Inexplicable visual phenomena located in deep space have caused extensive speculation and media interest.

There is no official terminology for the signals but they are referred to by many names, most popular of which is 'the anomalies'. Appearing as a bright flare with spiralling radial arms, they emit electromagnetic feedback that can be detected using full spectrum system (FSS) scanners.

The first anomaly was discovered beyond the permit-locked Col 70 sector, with additional signals now observed. Multiple calculations have verified that the objects are moving, supposedly at faster-than-light speeds. Various estimates as to their trajectory have been made, but the great distances involved defy accurate measurement.

The appearance of the anomalies so soon after the Battle of HIP 22460 has led many to assume that they are somehow related to the Thargoids. These fears have been exacerbated by the claims of the Far God cult that this is a sign of their deity's imminent arrival, but early analysis has yielded no evidence that the anomaly is Thargoid in origin.

The engineer Kit Fowler collated several ideas during his End Times broadcast:

« The anomaly could be some form of hyperspace distortion generated by an exceptionally large object heading our way. Or maybe the Thargoids have built a dimensional portal, through which their fleets can attack anywhere. Perhaps they've fired a colossal system-destroying weapon at Sol, as an act of revenge against humanity for the Proteus Wave. We've got to prepare for the very worst, people! »

However, Professor Elizabeth Perez of Orion University quickly dismissed these theories:

« Such outlandish notions illustrate how people draw imaginary patterns between unconnected events. Scientific progress has not stopped us inventing human-centric explanations for natural phenomena, especially when experiencing feelings of guilt or paranoia. »


* Federal Crackdown on Thargoid Worshippers
The Federal government has declared the Order of the Far God to be a potential enemy of the state.

The following press statement was delivered from the White House on Mars:

« The Federal Navy Intelligence Office has uncovered sufficient cause for concern to suspect the Far God cult of treason. They are believed to be responsible for leaking classified audiovisual data from the HIP 22460 system, while sharing other sensitive Thargoid-related material internally. Due to this, the risk that they will frustrate anti-xeno operations is deemed considerable. »

« President Hudson has therefore ordered military units to take control of all hive-chapels in Federal systems. Their inhabitants will be placed in detention facilities and subject to questioning. »

In related news, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has sponsored a resolution petitioning Congress to make the Order of the Far God illegal. She has cited constitutional amendments that prevent citizens from providing aid and comfort to an enemy of the state.

The civil rights organisation Advocacy, the Galactic Interfaith Commune and the Spiritual Freedom Movement have all condemned these actions. However, political opinion polls suggest that a majority of voters are in favour of banning the Far God cult in the Federation.

Shadow President Felicia Winters issued the following response:

« I understand there are concerns regarding a Thargoid-based religious order, especially at this time. But there must be concrete evidence supporting these allegations before we treat our own citizens as enemies. It seems to me that Hudson's administration is desperate to appear 'tough on Thargoids' after the debacle in HIP 22460, and has found an easy scapegoat to generate popular support. »


* Tesreau Announces Bid to Reform Aegis
A media forum is being arranged that will officially propose reinstating the tri-superpower anti-xeno agency.

The event is being organised by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research for Aegis. She delivered a statement to all newsfeeds:

« As the war against the Thargoids intensifies, the need for centralised xenological research is more vital than ever. This press conference will put forward a case to convince leaders in the Alliance, Empire and Federation to review their decision to dismantle Aegis. »

« The Baumann Report highlighted many of Aegis's limitations, and we do not intend to ignore these. Improvements to several departments would have to be made. But the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism Unit proved that cross-superpower collaboration can be efficient, flexible and effective. Aegis could be restructured along similar lines to prevent repeating its past mistakes. »

Invitations to the conference have been sent to key political figures. Allied Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran has agreed to attend. Federal Ambassador Jasmina Halsey has offered her support, but no members of Congress have responded publicly. The Imperial Senate acknowledged Professor Tesreau, but formally stated that the Empire has no interest in further cooperation with the other superpowers at this time.

The three-day forum is scheduled to begin on Monday 3rd October in New Apollo City on the planet Biggs Colony.


* Thargoids Retreat from Three Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The conflicts in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems have ended with the withdrawal of Thargoid vessels.

All three systems reported the simultaneous arrival of Thargoid forces on the 12th of September, following an expansion of their presence from HIP 22460. Unlike many previous incursions, however, no starports came under direct attack.

Large numbers of independent pilots volunteered to defend the systems' populations. Commanders BL1P, EmulatedPenguin and Klemyr, in particular, distinguished themselves in battle against the Thargoids, setting an example among many skilled pilots and AX squadrons that took part.

The Federal Navy also sent several Farragut-class battle cruisers, each outfitted with specialist AX weaponry, to directly engage the Thargoids. These have now been redeployed, with Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori claiming: « The overwhelming firepower of the Federation's capital ships proved more than a match for our alien foe. »

However, other sources claimed that the Thargoid fleets were not completely spent and instead made a tactical withdrawal. Several witnesses, interviewed by Vox Galactica field reporters, claim to have observed large numbers of undamaged Thargoid vessels departing into hyperspace.

The formally organised defence operations have already concluded, but contributing pilots can still collect their rewards from Bennington's Rest in the 42 n Persei system, Samuda Terminal in the Chun Pindit system, and Riemann Colony in the Tekkeitjal system.


* Federal Forces Target the True Chapters
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Conflict has erupted in Popontia as the Federation seeks to apprehend True Chapters cultists of the Far God cult.

The Workers of Popontia Free, which is sympathetic to the sect's right to practise its religion, was outfitting the Dedicant megaship for the chapter's use. Federal ships have been deployed in the Popontia system with the intention of detaining all cultists and seizing the megaship.

Governor Nadia Machado, representing Popontia Incorporated, declared:

« By order of President Hudson, all Thargoid worshippers are under suspicion of espionage and abetting our alien enemies. The True Chapters group is ordered to surrender for lawful questioning. »

Popontia Incorporated has been tasked with overseeing this mission. Payment has been authorised for Federal auxiliaries and independent pilots willing to pledge their support in subduing True Chapters supporters.

From the Testament megaship, the First Apostle of the True Chapters delivered a broadcast across public channels:

« The Dedicant will be a new home for us to await the Far God's arrival. We are prepared to die to defend this holy calling. Our recognised patrons in the Workers of Popontia Free will fight to protect us and reward those who aid our cause. »

These unprecedented hostilities were commented on by Dr Alfred Ulyanov, an academic authority on the Order of the Far God:

« This is the first time that members of this faith have not calmly accepted their own fate. According to my research, the First Apostle preaches that the Far God will transform her followers upon Its manifestation, allowing them to survive while the rest of humanity is extinguished. This has evidently motivated True Chapters adherents to abandon their wholly passive stance. »

Both campaigns are being orchestrated by contacts in the system's primary starport, Ryman Market.


* Delivery Campaign Helps Fund Imperial Charity
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

An initiative in the Cemiess system has procured sufficient rare items to ensure a successful Citizens' Relief Trust gala.

The new charitable organisation will establish support centres for the relatives of Imperial citizens who have died as a result of Thargoid aggression. The trust's patron, Princess Aisling Duval, made a declaration via public media:

« The quantity of Eshu Umbrellas, Xihe Biomorphic Companions and Chateau De Aegaeon that we received have gladdened my heart. I am already preparing invitations for a splendid charity gala at my palace on Emerald, where these luxuries will be auctioned to raise capital for the Citizens' Relief Trust. »

« I offer my personal thanks to everyone who took part in this campaign. Your efforts will directly honour those who paid the ultimate price in this horrific conflict with the Thargoids. »

Shipments of wine and fish were also provided, and will be served to the expected attendees and related entourages.

A public statement was also made by Senator Denton Patreus:

« It is Imperial Navy protocol to provide financial support to the families of all officers, crew and support staff whose lives are lost in the performance of their duties. Nevertheless, we all appreciate Her Highness's public spirit, and I'm pleased to see just how much the noble houses are prepared to sacrifice to assist the citizenry. »

Contributing pilots can now collect payment for their deliveries at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system. Luxury vessel paint jobs will be made available to qualifying pilots soon. Lavigny's Legion has confirmed that it will also reimburse combat bonds.


* FSS Upgrade to Track Anomalous Signals
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Full spectrum system (FSS) scanners are being updated with the aim of discovering the nature of the interstellar anomalies.

Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics, gave this statement to the press:

« The scientific community remains fascinated by the phenomena that we have classified as 'rogue signal sources'. At present we can calculate their approximate direction and velocity, but otherwise they remain a mystery. We have therefore worked with several corporations to enhance the ability of ships to analyse the signals. »

« Engineers from Auger Vision, Jick Nackson Enterprises, Long Embedded Systems, LURP Ship Systems and other specialist companies collaborated to improve the long-range detection capabilities of FSS scanners. Their collaborative efforts produced a firmware upgrade that is designed to isolate these unique electromagnetic emissions. »

« By agreement with every ship manufacturer, Universal Cartographics has rolled out this free update to all FSS scanners. Our hope is that with more pilots targeting the rogue signal sources, we can triangulate their positions more accurately and, perhaps, determine their composition. »

The objects continue to travel at faster-than-light speeds between distant systems, defying all attempts to intercept them. Their appearance does not match any naturally occurring stellar bodies known to science.


* Militaries Prepare for Further Thargoid Strikes
The prospect of more systems being invaded by Thargoids has placed the Alliance, Empire and Federation on high alert.

Ernesto Rios, field correspondent for Vox Galactica, summarised the situation:

« Following the Battle of HIP 22460, there was anticipation that the Thargoids would expand into neighbouring regions. Swarms of hostile vessels did indeed arrive in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems, although \u2013 in a notable change to their former tactics \u2013 no starports suffered a direct attack. »

« The Federal Navy quickly responded by deploying Farragut-class battle cruisers. President Zachary Hudson proclaimed that these successfully drove out the invaders, but many observers suspect that the Thargoids' withdrawal when the fighting remained fierce was intentional. »

« In the Empire, Senator Denton Patreus considered these events 'an indication that the Thargoids are probing humanity's defensive capabilities'. But details of the Imperial Navy's anti-xeno strategy remained confidential, a sign of the Empire shift away from military coordination with other superpowers. »

« The Alliance has claimed to be in a position of readiness. Admiral Nikolas Glass reported: 'Operation Tyndareus, backed by Sirius Corporation, is now active. The Alliance Defence Force is ready to deploy anti-xeno taskforces, should the Thargoids dare to launch an assault within Allied space.' Meanwhile, critics of the strategic defence pact have observed that only two megaships currently possess AX weaponry, casting doubt over the ADF's effectiveness. »

« Elsewhere, many independent systems are doing whatever they can to bolster their local security forces. Too many worlds are acutely aware that should Thargoid fleets darken their skies, they would be forced to rely on mercenaries and independent pilots for protection. »

« Popular opinion on continued military actions against Thargoid vessels remains primarily favourable, but the 'xeno-peace' discussion continues to grow. In the Aiabiko system, leading ICE personality Joy Senne has released a 'beacon drop' package in an effort to promote the idea of peace to independent pilots. Ships scanning the beacon will receive a xeno-affirmative ship nameplate set and decal - paid for by Senne - along with clips of a recent discussion with Sovereign Times anchor Heimar Borichev about the so-called 'Thargoid Advocacy Project'. »


* Making the Case for Aegis
A three-day symposium has begun that will outline proposals to reform Aegis, the tri-superpower anti-xeno agency.

The event is taking place at the national conference centre in New Apollo City on the planet Biggs Colony. It has been organised by Professor Alba Tesreau, Aegis's former head of research. In her opening address to attendees, she said:

« In the aftermath of HIP 22460's failure to end the war, humanity remains locked in this fight against the Thargoids. I believe that we have become hyper-focused on military action, meaning we may never truly understand this species. Aegis's collaborative nature was ideally suited for such work, but internal and external pressures resulted in its closure. I am officially declaring my aim to convince the Alliance, Empire and Federation to reverse that closure. »

Detailed plans to reform the organisation were presented by other former members of Aegis including Carter Armstrong, Dr Mia Valencourt and Yazhu Xing. Several issues highlighted by the Baumann Report, including mismanagement and low morale, were openly addressed. The audience was shown evidence that the loss of the Alexandria megaship, originally seen as an example of Aegis's negligence, was due to sabotage and hijacking by Azimuth Biotech agents.

The hosts were also asked about the xeno-peace movement and the popular audio package released last week by ICE-caster Joy Senne. Professor Tesreau stated:

« Neither I nor any former Aegis staff are involved with the Thargoid Advocacy Project or any similar groups. But I have always believed that researching methods of inter-species communication should be a priority. »

A combination of politicians, scientists, naval officers and journalists were present on the first day of the event. The most high-profile guests included Allied Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, Federal Ambassador Jasmina Halsey and Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester. There were no representatives from the Empire, but a delegation from the Marlinist Colonies observed proceedings.


* Gatecrash Drama at Aegis Event
The sole survivor of the notorious Project Seraph experiments has reportedly appeared at the Aegis symposium, startling the live audience.

Vox Galactica journalist Allan Mantle published an on-the-scene report:

« The shouting caught everyone in the conference hall by surprise, interrupting a discussion about the recently leaked 'Thargoid roar' heard at HIP 22460. We all watched in amazement as a small figure in dishevelled clothing slipped past security and fought her way onto the stage, disarming several guards who sought to intervene. Many ran, fearing an attack, but Professor Alba Tesreau stood her ground. »

« The bedraggled woman yelled hoarsely that her name was Seo Jin-ae, adding 'You know me!' to Tesreau herself. When the intruder yanked up her sleeve as if to show something, I deployed my drone cameras which clearly captured the symbols 'D-2' ink-branded onto her forearm. »

« She then grabbed Professor Tesreau and said 'I don't know where else to go. I know\u2026' She gestured at the screens, where audio analysis of the HIP 22460 Thargoid sound was displayed. 'I think I know what that means. It's too late to stop what's coming.' »

« Tesreau immediately ordered security to stand down. She called several other former members of Aegis to help, and together they escorted the woman off stage. Within minutes came the announcement that the symposium's primary presentation was cancelled, with secondary talks would be moved to the main stage. »

Subject D-2 first came to light when the abandoned settlement Oaken Point was discovered in the HIP 26176 system. Its logs described Project Seraph's attempts to create human pilots for Thargoid vessels, from which D-2 escaped by stowing away on a courier's ship. In June, D-2 contacted Professor Tesreau to expose an INRA base in the DG Canum Venaticorum system, which revealed Salvation's identity as Dr Caleb Wycherley of then-Azimuth Biochemicals.


* Operation Tyndareus Reacts to Thargoid Fleet
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Alliance has deployed a reactionary task force to defend the Andecavi system from the Thargoids.

An anti-xeno taskforce, titled Operation Tyndareus, was recently prepared by the Alliance Defence Force in conjunction with Sirius Corporation. This followed the ratification of the strategic defence pact between the superpower and the megacorp.

Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Council of Admirals, announced:

« The Thargoids have encroached upon Allied territory, providing an opportunity for Operation Tyndareus to put this newly legislated partnership to the test. The megaships provided by Sirius Corp are on combat readiness for just such an event, and Kumiho Sky has jumped directly to the Andecavi system to act as a mobile base of operations. The ADF will spearhead our counter-attack against the alien forces. »

« These are still early days for our unified anti-xeno efforts, so we are requesting additional support from independent pilots. Sirius Corporation will award its pre-engineered heatsink module to those who destroy adequate numbers of Thargoid vessels. »

The Andecavi system reported the presence of Thargoids over the past forty-eight hours.  However, as with recent incursions into other populated systems, no starports have yet been attacked. Sirius Corporation will reimburse Thargoid combat bonds delivered to the Kumiho Sky over the next seven days.


* Defeat for the True Chapters
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A battle in the Popontia system has ended with Federal forces overwhelming defenders of the True Chapters sect.

The newly risen sect of the Order of the Far God was being protected by the Workers of Popontia Free, which was ultimately defeated. Governor Nadia Machado of the Popontia Incorporated announced:

« With the welcome support of auxiliaries and independent pilots, armed resistance in this system has been quelled. As per President Hudson's orders, the Thargoid worshippers will be detained and the megaship Dedicant seized for Federal investigation. »

Governor Machado added that all pilots who took part in the operation can now collect their rewards from Ryman Market. Despite its failure, the Workers of Popontia Free is also offering payments from Ryman Market.

The two remaining Far God megaships, the Testament and the Perdition, have abandoned their scheduled itineraries and jumped to unknown locations to avoid further strikes by Federal forces. Prior to this, the First Apostle transmitted a message from the Testament:

« This attempt to conceal the truth is doomed to fail. The Far God's harbingers blaze in our skies, growing ever nearer. We await the time of humanity's unavoidable extinction. »


* Azimuth: 'We Can Help D-2'
Azimuth Biotech has publicly offered assistance to Subject D-2, the Project Seraph survivor who gate-crashed the recent Aegis symposium.

The woman, now identified as Seo Jin-ae, unexpectedly arrived at the event on Tuesday. She claimed to possess knowledge of the 'Thargoid roar' that was heard at HIP 22460 following the Proteus Wave's activation. There is speculation that this relates to her inclusion in experiments to create human pilots for Thargoid vessels.

Professor Alba Tesreau has since issued a brief statement:

« Along with other former members of Aegis, I have provided sanctuary to Seo Jin-ae. She is currently receiving medical treatment at a private facility. Ms Seo's safety and welfare is now my responsibility. »

Torben Rademaker, CEO of Azimuth Biotech, made the following declaration on public channels:

« We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the individual known as D-2, and would like to extend an offer of assistance. This tragically mistreated individual will receive little help from a random assortment of ex-Aegis personnel. With our decades of research and xenological specialists, Azimuth Biotech is far better suited to assess both her physical and mental health. »

« Her wellbeing would be our main concern, of course, but the possibility that D-2 can somehow interpret Thargoid communications should not be dismissed. We can help her to explore this ability, which may grant important insights into the Thargoid species. »

« I must also clarify that the Project Seraph facilities in HIP 22460 and HIP 26176 were under Salvation's direct control, and were kept hidden from the wider corporation. The discovery of these sites was as much a shock to me as anybody else. It's a matter of personal regret that Azimuth's long history includes examples of such misguided operations. We are eager to make amends for Salvation's mistakes. »


* Winters Condemns Oppression of Thargoid Cult
The Popontia conflict and the mass arrest of Far God cultists have received civil and political criticism across the Federation.

Shadow President Felicia Winters delivered a statement to The Federal Times:

« It is logical that any organisation supporting the Thargoids should come under scrutiny. But this does not justify the harsh and oppressive treatment of our own citizens for their religious beliefs. The Federal Accord safeguards their right to worship, as long as no laws are transgressed. »

« The Federal Navy Intelligence Office has accused the cult of disseminating classified material and damaging anti-xeno operations. I demand that their evidence be shared with the High Court, so that a legal ruling can be made. »

« I also call upon Congress to reject the secretary of state's proposal to outlaw the Order of the Far God. This is nothing more than a blatant effort to prop up President Hudson's waning powerbase. »

A multiple-choice survey held by Sol Today resulted in the majority selecting 'traitorous cowards' to describe cult members, showing that Hudson's order is not without support. However, a Federal Free Press opinion poll suggested that many citizens are uncomfortable with hostile acts against 'deluded but essentially innocent people'.

The Perdition and Testament megaships have now withdrawn from their standard patrol between the core system and the Pleaides, presumably to avoid further acts of hostility from the Federation. Dr Alfred Ulyanov observed that Federal citizens of the cult, along with the few remaining True Chapters adherents, were now concentrated aboard these megaships. Orthodox Far God hive-chapels are believed to still operate in Allied and independent systems.


* Subject D-2 Rejects Azimuth
Seo Jin-ae, the Project Seraph survivor, has refused to have any further contact with Azimuth Biotech following its offer of help.

She is currently in the care of Professor Alba Tesreau, who stated:

« It will come as no surprise that Ms Seo vehemently rejects Mr Rademaker's proposal. She has relayed horrific details to me about her abduction years ago, and the invasive experimentation at Oaken Point. The fear that Azimuth operatives were hunting her never passed, resulting in total isolation from her former life to protect friends and loved ones. As things stand, she has no reason to trust the organisation responsible for her suffering. »

« Ms Seo's health has improved, but I'm informed that a significant neural implant grafted into her cerebral cortex \u2013 designed to interface with a Thargoid vessel \u2013 can never be removed. With her permission, we are working to better understand the manner of the surgeries inflicted upon Ms Seo, along with her claimed interpretation of the 'Thargoid roar'. I have contacted both Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah for assistance. »

Azimuth Biotech CEO Torben Rademaker expressed disappointment at the response, and cast doubt on Seo Jin-ae's legitimacy: « In her fragile emotional state, D-2 may be vulnerable to coercion by Professor Tesreau and other ex-Aegis radicals. Our medical teams have access to records detailing the procedures Oaken Point surgeons were carrying out. It would be unwise of Tesreau to choose self-interest over the chance to truly heal D-2. »

In related news, several newsfeeds have reported an initial bump in public support for the reinstatement of Aegis. Following her attendance at the symposium, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran told the Old Worlds Gazette:

« Operation Tyndareus has been initiated, with forces engaged in protecting the Andecavi system. Yet the Alliance should not rely exclusively on Sirius Corporation for anti-xeno defence. I believe that the return of Aegis is an option deserving serious consideration. »


* Thargoids Repulsed by Operation Tyndareus
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Allied forces have successfully defended the Andecavi system from Thargoid vessels.

The defence operation was centred around the megaship Kumiho Sky, which hosted the Alliance and Sirius Corporation's joint anti-xeno taskforce. A declaration of victory was made by Admiral Nikolas Glass:

« Operation Tyndareus is officially a triumph! Alliance Defence Force and Sirius Navy crews have fought side by side to protect the people of Andecavi from the Thargoids. The aliens withdrew from the system en masse, following several days of hard fighting. »

« The taskforce was ably supported by many freelance pilots and AX squadrons, who can now claim their rewards from the Kumiho Sky. These include unique pre-engineered heatsink modules for qualifying xeno-hunters. In addition, the modules will shortly be commercially available via official Sirius Corporation technology brokers. »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon expressed gratitude to all those who took part, remarking that the long delays in making the strategic defence pact a reality « have finally proved to be worthwhile ».

In response, Councillor Nakato Kaine highlighted reports from witnesses that many Thargoid vessels withdrew into hyperspace before human forces overwhelmed them. She added:

« Would the result in Andecavi have been any different without Sirius Corporation's involvement? We have seen the Thargoids retreat while several conflicts were still evenly matched, just as in several other systems recently. Did this military pact deliver anything that the ADF could not have achieved alone? »


* Congressional Candidate Endorses Xeno-Peace Movement
Dalton Chase, the Federal governor of Andavandul 1, is campaigning to become a member of Congress with support from the Thargoid Advocacy Project.

A profile of Governor Chase was published in The Federal Times by political journalist Sofia Trevino:

« Despite only being in his mid-thirties with a short political career, Dalton Chase has made a habit of beating the odds. He achieved a very strong following within his home system of Andavandul, eclipsing more experienced rivals to become a planetary governor. »

« This is largely due to his willingness to reach beyond the mainstream. Many politicians claim the kind of exuberance and natural charisma that Chase possesses, but few would risk talking about the Thargoids using pointed phrases such as 'communication not extermination'. Younger voters are drawn to his boldness, as are the ICE-casters who routinely invite him onto their platforms. »

« Following the unfortunate incident that recently befell Congressman Theodore Pachis , a rare vacancy has opened within the Federation's grandest political body. Governor Chase should be the least likely candidate, except for the fact that he has become something of a poster boy for the xeno-peace movement. A key pledge of Chase's electoral campaign is to pursue ways of opening human-Thargoid diplomatic channels. »

« The Thargoid Advocacy Project is promoting Chase as the best chance to get Congress to take their ideas seriously. This in turn has fuelled a media backlash from some quarters, with Sol Today claiming he relies on 'the alien-lover vote'. We will soon learn if Dalton Chase's popularity among that demographic is enough to see him elected to high office. »


* Emperor Celebrates Imperial Strength
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has expressed satisfaction with the Empire's military and scientific progress since the Battle of HIP 22460.

She delivered the public address following a recent tour of a Gutamaya shipyard:

« The Imperial Navy is entering a period of revitalisation, with advances being made in multiple areas. We have been freed from the burden of external mismanagement, which hindered our military potential and diluted our naval strength. »

« The Senate has worked tirelessly to generate funding and opportunities for this renewed focus. New ships and crews have replaced recent losses, making our naval fleets more powerful than ever. And many loyal corporations have replaced inferior imports from foreign worlds with the high-quality workmanship of Imperial artisans. »

« Alongside increased military and commercial might, the Imperial Science Academy leads the way on xenological research to uncover the secrets of our Thargoid foe. We have seen the disastrous nature of Proteus Wave technology, but using alternative methods to develop our own anti-xeno options remains a priority. »

« Imperial systems are better protected against our enemies than they have been in a generation. Never has the future looked so assured. Our glorious history, stretching over a thousand years, teaches us a truth that we must now relearn: The Empire stands stronger alone. »


* Federation Bans the Far God Cult
President Hudson has approved a congressional bill to make the Order of the Far God illegal within all Federal systems.

Congress voted to accept the resolution by a narrow majority, as announced by Secretary of State Lana Berkovich:

« The Thargoids are categorised as an enemy of the state, and the Federal Accord forbids any citizen from providing aid to such enemies. The likelihood of radicalised Thargoid worshippers disrupting our anti-xeno operations in the name of their deity deserves a proactive response. »

« Therefore, by Act of Congress, membership of this religious order is now a crime punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment. The organisation is barred from operating anywhere in Federal space. All detained Far God adherents are being interrogated for information related to espionage, with many already transported to stand trial in their home systems. »

Congress has clarified that the resolution specifically targets 'organisations which actively support the military objectives of non-humans'. It does not apply to civil groups promoting inter-species communication or diplomacy, such as the Thargoid Advocacy Project.

The Galactic Interfaith Commune and similar agencies have protested against the new law. Shadow President Felicia Winters shared their disapproval, claiming that « such intolerance does not reflect the Federation's core values ». Some congressmen have also voiced fears of the potential impact on voters who follow other fringe religions.

With the Far God cult now illegal in both the Empire and the Federation, its hive-chapels can only be found in Allied and independent systems with local laws permitting religious liberty. The True Chapters sect's remaining adherents are concentrated aboard the Perdition and Testament megaships, the locations of which are unknown.


* Talk Show Murder Broadcast
Channel 07 has intercepted footage of a violent attack on three talk show hosts, broadcast live on several Imperial newsfeeds.

The show came to an abrupt halt after the three were apparently fired upon by an assailant who gained access to the enclosed set. The perpetrator managed to flee the building before security could intervene.

Details on the status of the victims have not been provided, but first responders to the scene found a digital calling card pinned to the host's dressing room door. Police have authorised the publication of the card's contents, which consists of a single word:

TFZIRQRL

The word is thought to be encoded by a text cipher. It is hoped that by sharing the text, members of the public will be able to identify the perpetrator's next move.


* Materials Required for Xeno-Peace Convoy
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Federal Governor Dalton Chase requests deliveries to the Andavandul system to establish a xeno-peace envoy vessel.

The initiative spearheaded by Chase, a member of the Liberal Party who is currently campaigning for a congressional seat, intends to provide a megaship for use in Thargoid Advocacy Project operations. He announced:

« The Federation's leaders are sworn to protect its people, yet our aggressive interactions with the Thargoids have placed entire systems in great danger. Order of the Far God cultists shouldn't be the image we conjure when suggesting non-military options. It's time to prove that we possess the capacity for peaceful relations with other species. »\t

« The convoy established on behalf of the Thargoid Advocacy Project is a non-partisan diplomatic mission representing humanity's call for a ceasefire. Its purpose is to find ways to communicate with the Thargoids and make peaceful overtures. Imagine it: diplomatic channels between different races. Peace in our time! Lend us your support to lay this foundation for a more harmonious future. »

Other notable figures in the xeno-peace movement have endorsed Governor Chase's congressional campaign. Leading ICE-caster Joy Senne has referred to him as 'our ambassador of hope'. Heimar Borichev revealed that Chase intends to lobby Shadow President Winters to incorporate Thargoid diplomacy into Liberal Party policies.

Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar has agreed to host the pro-peace megaship initiative, and will organise payment for shipments of computer components, semiconductors and titanium to Blenkinsop Hub in the Andavandul system. To protect deliveries, Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar will also reimburse combat vouchers for all wanted ships.


* Hadrian Duval Endorses Imperial Isolation
The Empire's withdrawal from all cross-superpower operations has gained the full support of Hadrian Augustus Duval.

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho reviewed the situation for The Imperial Herald:

« As the illegitimate grandson of Emperor Hengist, Hadrian Duval has long been considered the 'black sheep' of the Imperial Family. Only a few years ago, he sought to replace Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval on the throne. But he has since been pardoned and accepted as a genuine Duval, albeit with no royal title or position. »

« Now, for the first time, Hadrian openly approves of the Emperor's decisions. As he told Paresa News Network: 'Walking away from the Alliance and Federation is the right path for the Empire to take. The Imperial Navy deserves to be our priority, to reinforce our strength and better defend us against our enemies.' »

« Senator Zemina Torval dismissed this as a 'hypocritical volte-face', but in truth, Hadrian has always championed isolationism and traditional Imperial values. He seems as surprised as anyone to find that Emperor Arissa now shares some of his political ideologies. Ironically, it is now Princess Aisling Duval who has emerged as the voice of rebellion against Imperial policy. »

« Others in the Senate have suggested that Hadrian Duval might serve the Empire in a more official capacity, or be bestowed a title and accepted into the nobility. The Emperor may find that the young man who was once her greatest threat could be transformed into a loyal ally. »


* The Call for Unity
Newsfeeds across the core systems have reflected the increasing public demand for full-scale military cooperation against the Thargoids.

Federal Free Press: « Removing the Far God cult from Federal space was a way of distracting the people from President Hudson's failures. The real threat remains the Thargoids themselves, and there is little chance of withstanding them without Allied and Imperial aid. »

Citizens' Chronicle: « With the greatest respect to Her Majesty, the Empire cannot pretend that it played no part in the disaster at HIP 22460. Surely we are strong enough to shoulder some of the burden in defeating this common enemy? »

Old Worlds Gazette: « After the Aegis symposium, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran supported reinstating the tri-superpower agency, claiming: 'The scale of the conflict deserves a stronger response than our pact with Sirius Corporation can provide.' »

The Marlin Standard: « The proximity of the Thargoids to our democratic republic has always been a major concern. Parliament has agreed that any collaborative anti-xeno initiative would be of great interest. »

Sol Today: « We all know that you can't trust the Imps or the Alliars. But at least they're not vicious genocidal monstrosities. And as General Falkenrath famously said: 'The enemy of my enemy is my disposable infantry.' »

The Sovereign: « The xeno-peace movement, as espoused by our very own Heimar Borichev, is laudable. But many independent systems are demanding a less diplomatic strategy. »

Vox Galactica: « The demands for a solution to the Thargoids are becoming more strident. According to unofficial reports, some low-level civil and military leaders have begun talking across the political divides, despite the lack of direction from their superiors. There is clearly a growing appetite for solidarity, whether through Aegis or some other means. »


* Thargoids Raid Nebula Colony
The human enclave within the California Nebula has reported multiple attacks from Thargoid forces.

Systems such as California Sector CQ-Y c5 and HIP 18077 have experienced direct assaults by large numbers of Thargoid vessels. Megaships in the area have also been attacked and left in disrepair, with surviving crews activating distress signals.

Harrison Gladstone, a spokesperson for Turner Research Group which oversees Allied operations in the region, gave a statement to Vox Galactica:

« We're accustomed to the Thargoid encounters in the California nebula, but this time their aggression caught everyone by surprise. Research teams have been recalled from the region's barnacle sites. It's just become too dangerous to send our people out there. »

Colonisation of the California Nebula took place in 3302 and focused primarily on harvesting meta-alloys from Thargoid barnacle sites. Although the enclave was initially established by the Alliance, the Kumo Crew's expansion into the area last year brought tension.

The Tau Ceti Journal reported that these latest attacks may directly impact the meta-alloy market. Some Federal corporations, which directly purchase this material from the Alliance, have warned that fresh sources of meta-alloys could be required to prevent commercial instability.


* Xeno-Peace Project Gathers Support
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries to the Andavandul system have enabled the Thargoid Advocacy Project to begin preparations for a diplomatic mission.

Governor Dalton Chase, who is campaigning to become a member of the Federal Congress, arranged the initiative to create a non-partisan envoy vessel. Its objective will be to find ways to open communication with the Thargoids and make peaceful overtures to end the conflict.

Polly  French, organiser of a Thargoid Advocacy Project rally in Andavandul, told the media:

« War with the Thargoids represents multiple failures. A failure to imagine coexistence with another intelligent species. A failure to restrain our violent reactions to the unknown. By sending emissaries and opening diplomatic channels, we can prove that human civilisation is advanced enough to seek peace. »

« I am grateful to Governor Chase for his generous funding and promotion of this project. Sincere thanks are also due to all the pilots who transported computer components, semiconductors and titanium, as well as those who fought hard to defend this operation. Personally, I'm very excited to see our new vessel for the first time. »

Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar is now offering payment and combat bond reimbursement to all contributors from Blenkinsop Hub in the Andavandul system.


* Superpowers Discuss Unified Anti-Xeno Fleet
Ambassadors of all three superpowers have held emergency talks following the California nebula attacks, with a united military fleet the primary topic.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling provided this report for Vox Galactica:

« The public demand to address the evolving Thargoid threat has led to key military personnel suggesting that the Allied, Federal and Imperial naval fleets could work in concert for the duration of the war. This once-inconceivable notion seems more plausible following the coalition in HIP 22460, despite the regrettable outcome of that operation. »

« Sources have confirmed that Admiral Rachel Ziegler sought to contact Admiral Maxton Price directly, to discuss ways in which the Alliance Defence Force and Federal Navy might collaborate. Others have openly supported the idea of 'a glorious grand armada to wipe out the alien hordes,' as Vice Admiral Juno Rochester phrased it. »

« However, there has been little in the way of political enthusiasm, with neither the Assembly nor Congress willing to debate the topic. Many leaders had their fingers burnt by aiding Salvation, which could dissuade them from extending the hand of comradeship once again. »

« And then there is the Empire, which lacks any interest in further collaboration with outside governments or organisations. While the Emperor pursues her new path of Imperial isolationism, the Imperial Navy's might cannot be relied upon to protect Allied, Federal or independent systems from Thargoid attack. »

« Nevertheless, the prospect of resurrecting the anti-xeno agency Aegis continues to gain traction. Professor Tesreau's recent symposium outlined plans for a new incarnation that would avoid the mistakes of the past. Even if we never see a grand human armada, the call for unity could manifest in a number of other ways. »


* Empire Dismisses Calls for Aegis Return
The Imperial Senate has debated contributing to anti-xeno activities such as Aegis or a unified superpower fleet.

Senator Caspian Leopold initiated the discussions among his colleagues, stating:

« One would never criticise Her Majesty's priority to defend the Empire above all else. Nevertheless, we face an adversary that how shown no sign of understanding humanity's many political, social or cultural distinctions. To them there is no Empire. Our citizens are simply more humans for the Thargoids to destroy. »

« If we were to share our research and resources with a reformed Aegis, might we not end the Second Thargoid War sooner? »

Imperial Admiral of the Fleet, Denton Patreus, responded:

« Let me be clear: Aegis has been consigned to history. Likewise, the idea of unifying all three superpower fleets is a completely impractical fantasy. We can best serve the Empire by reinforcing the Imperial Navy and other military forces serving the Emperor. »

« I assure you, senators, that we are closely monitoring Thargoid activity and the threat is currently contained. The anomalous signals moving towards the core systems are being tracked. But should any xeno force encroach upon Imperial territory, we are more than ready. »

The issue was laid to rest Chancellor Anders Blaine:

« Esteemed colleagues, there is great honour in exploring how best to protect our people from the alien foe. But I must remind you: a decree from the Emperor cannot be overruled, not even by this august chamber. The Empire will abstain from collaborating with the Alliance, Federation or any other foreign nation until Her Majesty wishes otherwise. »


* Council of Admirals Divided Over Unified Fleet
The Alliance Defence Force has been unable to reach a consensus over the proposal to combine the superpowers' forces against the Thargoids.

Admirals Liam Flanagan , George Varma and Rachel Ziegler all openly support the concept of a unified fleet formed of Allied, Federal and Imperial vessels. However, Admirals Nikolas Glass, Maristela Silva  and Tahir West have rejected this in favour of focusing on the strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation.

Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin, the highest ranking officer in the Alliance Defence Force, has yet to reveal her own view. When pressed by a journalist from the Old Worlds Gazette, she commented: « A decision of such magnitude is more political than military, and therefore the province of the Assembly. »

There was a more forthright statement from Admiral Ziegler, who previously commanded an Allied anti-xeno taskforce:

« This refusal to accept that we must come together to fight the Thargoids is enormously disappointing. Many of our counterparts in the Federal Navy are keen to increase links between militaries, and I firmly believe that we would soon convince the Empire to join us. We must not indefinitely rule out re-establishing Aegis or a similar anti-xeno initiative. »

In related news, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran has proposed a bill to the Assembly approving the reformation of Aegis. However, this has not received enough support to be formally debated and would achieve little without similar acts in the Federal Congress or Imperial Senate.


* Peace with the Thargoids?
The rise of the xeno-peace movement has caused a number of public figures to discuss coexisting peacefully with the Thargoid race.

With military options currently under discussion in the political capitals of all three superpowers, calls for diplomacy have sought to keep pace. Professor Shamus Madigan, Head of Xenology at Olympus Village University, is one of several figures to have weighed in on the matter:

« The ancient records of the Guardians, as deciphered by Ram Tah, describe how they learned enough of the Thargoids' language to make peaceful overtures. These were rejected in favour of total war. Though millions of years have passed, it seems improbable that the Thargoids will view humanity any differently - particularly since we actively deploy Guardian-based weaponry against them. »

Federal Governor Dalton Chase:

« Assuming the communications barrier can be broken, I see no reason why we cannot have non-violent relations with these obviously intelligent beings. The recently consigned pro-peace megaship will help demonstrate to the Thargoids that we are not a single-minded warlike race, but a fellow advanced civilisation. »

Jaya Chaudhary , host of historical ICE-cast 'Ghastly Pasts':

« Human-Thargoid diplomacy might have been possible when our two species first encountered each other. But since then we have made two attempts to eradicate them, first with the mycoid compound and then with the Proteus Wave superweapon. Let's be honest: would we want to talk to an alien race that did that to us? »

Ambassador Jasmina Halsey, former president of the Federation:

« We have discovered a little about the Thargoids' history, behaviour and technologies. But their thought processes and reasoning may be utterly different to our own. I have no idea if they even comprehend what diplomacy is, let alone whether we could find common ground. But I do know that we must try, if only to prove to ourselves that we can do better. »


* Azimuth to Expand Operational Assets
Azimuth Biotech has announced a campaign in the Wandrama system to expand its military and surface facility capacity.

The controversial weapons developer has seen a recent downturn in fortunes, due to fierce opposition by independent pilots protesting Azimuth's history of illicit research. The failure of Salvation to bring an end to the war has also soured public sentiment towards the corporation.

Azimuth Biotech CEO Torben Rademaker announced the initiative:

« After a period of reflection, it is time for Azimuth to once again step forward and assume a position of support for the brave pilots engaging Thargoid forces wherever they are encountered. To do this, we shall establish a new megaship equipped to operation in Thargoid-tainted systems. The tragic loss of the Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus in HIP 22460 must not hinder our ambition any further. »

« We also intend to operate several surface outposts to aid our research projects. We aim to contribute to humanity's military options once again, being careful not to repeat the mistakes of our former figurehead. »

Pilots contributing to Azimuth's campaign, hosted at the Musashi megaship in Wandrama, will be granted the Mbooni permit and access to the company's range of anti-xeno weaponry. Rademaker has promised that a successful campaign will allow for the Glorious Prospect to offer the Mbooni permit from the T-Tauri system permanently.

Within hours of the announcement, opponents of Azimuth Biotech had organised a counter-campaign to prevent deliveries from reaching Wandrama. Combat between Azimuth security forces and anti-Azimuth activists has been reported in the system. It is believed efforts to derail the campaign are being directed from MacLean City by Wandrama Purple Council.

In an effort to rally combat pilots to their respective causes, both factions are offering module rewards. Azimuth Biotech is offering its overcharged Guardian plasma charger, while Wandrama Purple Council promises a rapid-fire multi-cannon with phasing sequence.


* Destination: Humanity
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

It has been confirmed that the mysterious anomalies known as rogue signal sources are all converging on the core systems.

Professor Yaro Kenyatta , a noted academic in astronomy-related fields, has been collaborating with Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah on analysing the unexplained objects. He published a summary of their work in the scientific journal The Empirical:

« The first of these distant objects was detected on the 31st of August 3308, but several more have since been identified. It was quickly apparent that they were travelling through interstellar space at faster-than-light speed. Full spectrum system (FSS) scanners were upgraded to allow more pilots to detect their electromagnetic emissions. »

« Data on these phenomena has been analysed by many respected organisations such as Canonn Interstellar Research Group, Orion University and Universal Cartographics. Their consensus is that the rogue signal sources are all approaching the core systems, home to the vast majority of the human population. »

« As yet, we cannot determine when and where they will arrive with complete certainty. But it now seems unlikely that these are naturally occurring stellar bodies. It follows that eight distinct anomalies converging upon our small region of the galaxy cannot be pure chance. Human space is their intended destination. »

« What will happen when they arrive? Judging by their astonishing energy output, they may be devastating to inhabited systems. Each signal could be an energy projectile or a navigation beacon for some unknown force. More fanciful suggestions include celestial beings beyond our comprehension, or interstellar technology we have never witnessed. Our intention is to narrow down the more probable options soon. »

« Alternatively, if these are hyperspace distortions caused by non-human vessels, it's possible they may decelerate as they draw near. But one conclusion can be made: whatever they are, they must know we are here. »


* Xeno-Peace Champion Elected to Congress
Dalton Chase, the former governor of Andavandul 1, has become a Federal congressman following victory in the recent special election.

Despite his relative youth and inexperience, many voters within the congressional district were influenced by Chase's charm and positive campaign message. His enthusiasm for opening diplomatic relations with the Thargoids resonated with younger voters. The Liberal Party also ran a creative PR campaign across social channels, which was amplified by many counter-cultural ICE-casters.

After formally swearing in and taking his oath of office, Congressman Chase proclaimed:

« I'm conscious that some view me as unorthodox or contrarian, perhaps even 'soft on Thargoids'. But I take the security of the Federation as seriously as any of my honourable colleagues. Achieving peace with another species, and thereby saving the lives of countless Federal citizens, would be considered the great moral victory of our generation. »

Congratulations were offered by Shadow President Felicia Winters, who referred to Chase as a « spirited addition to our ranks ». Political analysts observed that she made no mention of his affiliation with the xeno-peace movement. Although some in the Liberal Party have expressed sympathy with its intentions, the majority consider it too radical to ever be officially endorsed.

Key members of the Thargoid Advocacy Project have thanked Congressman Chase for helping to establish the pro-peace megaship, Kingfisher. This is currently being outfitted with specialist technology designed to transmit signals of various types, in the hope of being able to effect two-way communication with the Thargoids.


* Understanding the 'Thargoid Roar'
Professor Alba Tesreau, Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah have released a joint statement regarding the alien sound heard at HIP 22460.

« There has been much speculation about the mysterious noise that was recorded following the Battle of HIP 22460, which is clearly of Thargoid origin. Thanks to the help of Seo Jin-ae, formerly known as Subject D-2, we have started to comprehend some of its meaning. »

« What was audible to humans was only part of a complex multi-frequency transmission, amplified by the energy surging through the Thargoid surface site which housed the Proteus Wave weapon. Its specifics remain indecipherable for the moment, but certain aspects were isolated with the aid of Ms Seo, whose unique neural implants were designed to interface with Thargoid technology. »

« She believes there is a 'call and response' element, as if the signal was a reply to the Thargoid forces in HIP 22460. This was interwoven with a sense of acknowledgement and focus, which Ms Seo described as: 'We see them. We are coming.' »

« Further insights from Ms Seo plus advanced audio analysis leads us to conclude that the sound emanated from a single Thargoid entity, and was transmitted with more power than anything previously encountered. »

« Popular theory has linked this 'Thargoid roar' to the anomalies known as rogue signal sources, which are currently converging on the core systems. Seo Jin-ae appears convinced that, whatever their ultimate motive may be, they have been deployed by the Thargoids as a direct response to Salvation's Proteus Wave weapon. »

« We solemnly predict that the Second Thargoid War is about to enter a new phase, and humanity may not yet be prepared to withstand it. »


* Azimuth Claim Expensive Success
The recent Azimuth Biotech initiative to expand its operation assets has been described as a 'partial success'.

A primary goal of obtaining sufficient resources to establish a new anti-xeno megaship has been met, Azimuth CEO Torben Rademaker announced. The megaship is expected to be operational within the next few weeks.

Opponents of the weapons research corporation, seeking to disrupt the campaign, mobilised forces to engage Azimuth security vessels. While unable to prevent sufficient deliveries from reaching the Musashi, it is thought these pilots inflicted significant losses on the Azimuth fleet.

« We are delighted with the support shown to Azimuth Biotech by independent pilots, and look to the future with optimism, » said Rademaker. « We will soon deploy a new AX megaship to lead our mobile operations. Setbacks inflicted by anarchic opponents of progress have delayed our plans to establish planetary research bases, however. This persistent antagonism will have to be resolved separately. »

Along with credit rewards, qualifying pilots that contributed to the delivery campaign will receive the Mbooni permit shortly, granting access to Azimuth's selection of AX weaponry. Rademaker confirmed that the Glorious Prospect megaship will now sell this permit from the T-Tauri system permanently.

Pilots who fought for Azimuth Biotech will also receive overcharged Guardian plasma chargers in storage at the Musashi, providing they reaches the contribution threshold. Those who fought against Azimuth will receive rapid-fire multi-cannons with phasing sequence from Wandrama Purple Council soon, collectable from MacLean City.


* Further FSS Scanner Upgrade Released
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A version of the FSS scanning software used to track the Thargoid anomalies has been made available to the Pilots' Federation.

Commanders should experience reduced interference when using the full spectrum system (FSS) scanner to focus on the anomalies. The team leading the development of the software, however, warned that the resultant clarity has done little to ease the concerns of Professor Palin, Ram Tah and other leading scientists.

Lori Jameson, an engineer contributing to the FSS scanner's software calibration, commented:

« We're pleased with the update and are happy to share it with Commanders, who have provided much of the data used by the institutions researching the rogue signal sources. Representatives of Canonn Interstellar Research Group, Orion University and Universal Cartographics have also helped greatly. I just wish the results generated a more promising picture. »

« I understand the calls for peace that we've been hearing more of. But judging by the feedback these signals are emitting, they're\u2026 well, I'm trying not to push my opinions on others. I urge Commanders to take a look with the FSS scanner for themselves. »

The update has been delivered to all registered Pilots' Federation vessels free of charge.


* Xeno-Peacers Reject Prediction of War
A claim that the rogue signal sources form part of a potential Thargoid offensive has been disputed by many in the pro-peace movement.

A joint statement by respected xenologists Professor Alba Tesreau, Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah concluded that the approaching anomalies are a reaction to events in HIP 22460, and may have dire consequences for humanity. The eight signal sources are projected to arrive in the core systems within weeks.

Advocates for the Thargoid Advocacy Project and similar xeno-peace groups have rejected the idea that increased hostilities with the Thargoids is inevitable. As community liaison Bernadette Wells  said on the Joy Senne ICE-cast:

« Despite this ominous claim from three respected scientists, they have offered no hard evidence to support the assumption that the anomalies are hostile. I'm sorry, I know Seo Jin-ae has suffered enormously as part of Salvation's unrelenting obsession with the Thargoids, but I don't think we should be using her vague instincts to inform official policy regarding this alien species. »

Heimar Borichev, deputy editor of The Sovereign newsfeed, claimed:

« With all the talk of the superpowers forming a grand fleet, why are we not demanding they form a grand diplomatic effort? Many in the Assembly, Congress and Senate agree with this sentiment, but are too scared to risk their careers. We need a concerted campaign, pressuring elected officials to stop listening to the vultures who stand to benefit from continued conflict with the Thargoids. »

Congressman Dalton Chase is one of the few politicians to openly agree with this argument. In an interview with the Federal Free Press, he said:

« The Kingfisher megaship was established to lead a mission of peace with the Thargoids. But imagine how much greater our chances of success would be with official support. I call upon my colleagues in the Federation, and like-minded leaders everywhere, to promote peaceful coexistence as a valid strategy. »


* Coalsack Nebula Reports Thargoid Activity
The human colonists in the Coalsack Nebula has raised the alarm after Thargoid forces appeared several systems.

Following recent attacks on systems and vessels in the California Nebula, it appears that the Thargoids have again sought to occupy systems where barnacle fields are present on planet surfaces.

Councillor Lewis Laychurch, representing the Alliance Expeditionary Pact in HIP 62154, provided the following to the Alliance Tribune:

« Our security craft regularly patrol between the populated systems in this region. We had the first reports of nonhuman signals this morning. Obviously we've seen Thargoid activity in the Coalsack Nebula several times before, but this time was different. It's not an attack as much as a presence. »

« We witnessed a huge upsurge in these signals in multiple systems. Over a couple of hours, it felt like Thargoid activity was visible on scanners wherever our ships looked. It's exclusively in areas with barnacle sites, too. »

Now, there's no secret that the Thargoids aren't happy with our interest in the meta-alloys those sites produce. But this time they're not attacking ports, or either the Spirit of Nysa or Song of Mecchi megaships. It's like they're waiting for something. »

The described behaviour matches similar Thargoid incursions into other populated systems in recent weeks. Researchers in the nebula have withdrawn from ongoing field studies of barnacle sites, citing safety concerns.

In other news, Azimuth Biotech has announced that the Glorious Prospect will distribute the Mbooni permit from the LHS 1163 system, instead of the T-Tauri system as planned. Federal authorities offered protection to the megaship to reduce the travel time between the two locations, granting combat pilots swift access to the anti-xeno weaponry offered at Prospect's Deep.


* Public Unnerved by Palin Announcement
The announcement that the rogue signal sources heading towards the core systems are Thargoid in origin has caused unease within the general public.

Protests in systems on the edges of human space have taken place, demanding assurances from local governments about their safety. The failure to establish a collective human fleet to counter Thargoid incursions has left many concerned about what the future may hold.

Casey Kilpatrick provided this report from Castellan Station in Lave:

« Colleagues across multiple systems have confirmed that the impending arrival of the rogue signal sources \u2013 termed 'stargoids' by some in network media \u2013 has led to a shared sense of anxiety. ICE networks are seeing high interest in topics related to Thargoids, with negative sentiment aimed at politicians and military figures seen as responsible for the Proteus Wave event which perhaps attracted the anomalies. Witnesses report families transporting all they own to ships bound for the opposite side of the bubble. »

« Palin's opinion that humanity may not be ready for what happens next has been criticised as needlessly alarming. While Palin is a brilliant scientist, his communication skills have been called 'less than ideal' in recent days. Yet his supporters, particularly among academics, have argued that it would be cowardly to hide the truth. If humanity is truly in danger, the statement at least could prompt a fresh allocation of resources to military organisations while also giving independents time to prepare. »

« Vista Genomics has reportedly contacted the team working alongside Professor Palin with a proposal to share its genetic database with ongoing research projects. The potential importance of such data may precede an increase in payments to those who record and submit genetic samples. »

« The news has also caused a stir across most financial markets. The main issue is the unpredictability of what this could mean for primary industries and their ability to maintain traditional supply and demand. The cost of goods and services may be impacted across clusters of systems. The Bank of Zaonce has announced it is monitoring the situation and is preparing several potential strategies in the event of an interstellar recession. »

« In conclusion, most are left with a rather unpalatable course of action: To sit and wait. No superpower has announced a means to prevent the Thargoid anomalies from reaching us. Palin's announcement has hypothesised on what the signals may be, but could not confirm what they will do. It appears that we will all find out together, for better or worse. »


* The Kingfisher Xeno-Peace Mission
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Kingfisher megaship has requested supplies for its planned journey to greet the first rogue signal source.

Shipments of basic medicines, fruit and vegetables are required for the Kingfisher's crew, who will be joined by over 3,000 supporters of the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Semiconductors and Muon Imagers have also been requested to establish the mission's communications arrays, which are being designed to initiate contact with the Thargoids.

Congressman Dalton Chase gave a press statement regarding the initiative:

« Now that we know the approaching anomalies are Thargoid, many are concerned that hostilities between our species will escalate. However, a brave group of volunteers see this as an opportunity to prove that diplomacy can work. An alien race has sent emissaries toward humanity's space, and it is our duty to meet them with words rather than weapons. »

« The first of the anomalies, which we have named Taranis, is predicted to pass through Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1. Using the high-level protocols available to Congress, I have successfully obtained a temporary access restriction that grants an exclusive permit to the Kingfisher. A range of broadcasts using multiple techniques will try to attract the Thargoids' attention. Hopefully, the entity will slow down long enough to give some acknowledgement of these attempts. »

The delivery initiative in the Andavandul system is being managed by Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar. In order to protect deliveries to Blenkinsop Hub, the faction is offering increased payouts on bounty voucher redemptions.


* The Coming of Taranis
As the rogue signal sources draw closer to human-occupied space, work is underway to initiate peaceful inter-species negotiations.

Dr Elias Pope  is a graduate of Orion University with degrees in interstellar relations, political science and xenology. He has recently joined the Kingfisher megaship's crew to oversee the Thargoid Advocacy Project's diplomatic mission. In an interview with Vox Galactica, Dr Pope explained his role:

« Like most of the Kingfisher's crew, I volunteered to take part in this operation. It feels like my whole professional life has been leading to this opportunity. Many of the fine people here feel the same way I do. If there's even a chance that we might begin properly talking to the Thargoids, well\u2026 it'll be historic. »

« Luria , my assistant, tells me there are some media-friendly names for these anomalies now. As a scientific purist, she's very unhappy about that! This first one has been labelled Taranis. It will transit through the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system at tremendous speed, so we won't have long to snag its attention. But that's what we're aiming to do. »

« The megaship has an impressive suite of audio-visual, electromagnetic and hyperspace transmitters that will broadcast to Taranis as it approaches. We'll be trying everything from flashing light patterns to multi-frequency data bursts. Establishing common ground is key to any negotiation, so I've composed messages that impart universally recognisable concepts such as mathematical formulae and star charts. These should illustrate our intellectual prowess and capacity for reasoning. »

« The best-case scenario is that whatever controls Taranis hears us and responds in kind. We must at least attempt to make peaceful overtures. Even if we fail, it would signify to humanity that there are many people willing to make the attempt, no matter how dangerous. Wish us luck. »


* Kingfisher Megaship Makes Final Preparations
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Kingfisher megaship has received commodities in advance of its mission to communicate with the first rogue signal source.

The Thargoid Advocacy Project reported that the shipments of semiconductors and Muon Imagers will contribute to the communications array aboard the megaship. The deliveries of basic medicines, fruit and vegetables will be made available to its crew and passengers, which include thousands of pro-peace supporters.

Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar has announced that contributors can now collect payment from Blenkinsop Hub in the Andavandul system. This includes bounty voucher reimbursements for all pilots who eliminated criminal vessels threatening deliveries during the initiative.

The Kingfisher will tomorrow make the journey from Andavandul to the permit-locked Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system. The first of the rogue signal sources, which has been named Taranis, will travel through the system within the next 48 hours. The precise nature of these faster-than-light anomalies remains unknown, but it is now accepted that they are of Thargoid origin.

Scheduling conflicts have prevented Congressman Dalton Chase from leading the diplomatic mission, despite his prominent role in organising the Kingfisher's construction. The Sovereign's deputy editor Heimar Borichev, another vocal supporter of the xeno-peace has announced plans to report from on board the megaship.


* Praise for the Pro-Peace Project
Congressman Dalton Chase has applauded the increased public support for the goal of opening diplomatic channels with the Thargoids.

During an exclusive interview with ICE-caster Joy Senne, he said:

« Not so long ago, the idea of communicating with the Thargoids seemed absurd. But look at what's happening in Andavandul right now! There's so much support from the galactic community. People are placing their faith in a better future than just endless warfare. »

« My only regret is that I won't be joining my fellow campaigners aboard the Kingfisher after all. The duties of my new congressional position mean that my diary has become full extremely quickly, with many commitments to uphold. But I'll be travelling with them in spirit as they journey out to meet Taranis, and prove to its Thargoid controllers that humanity is ready to co-exist peacefully. »

Joy Senne revealed that she had planned to ICE-cast a live show from the Kingfisher megaship, as it encountered the interstellar anomaly known as Taranis in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system:

« I was so disappointed when they told me that only direct transmissions aimed at Taranis would be permitted, to avoid confusing the 'stargoid' with other signals. Our good friend Heimar Borichev was due to join the crew today, but he messaged me less than an hour ago saying he'd fallen ill unexpectedly. So it's left to the brave volunteers \u2013 we're counting on you, Kingfisher! »

The Sovereign newsfeed confirmed these plans for its deputy editor, adding that opinion polls in independent systems suggested a 32% approval rate for the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Allied and Federal media primarily view the xeno-peace movement as 'misguided', while in the Empire the most common keyword associated with them is 'suicidal'.


* Kingfisher Megaship Vanishes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Contact has been lost with the Kingfisher megaship in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system, just over a day since its arrival.

The Kingfisher was equipped to transmit signals to the interstellar anomaly named Taranis, with the goal of opening communications with it should such a possibility exist. Over 3,000 supporters of the xeno-peace movement were aboard the megaship when it departed the Andavandul system.

Rani Zaman , a spokesperson for the Thargoid Advocacy Project team monitoring long-range comms with the megaship, issued a statement to the media:

« I regret to say that all attempts to raise the Kingfisher on any frequency have failed. The last message we received was highly distorted, but seemed to be a distress call. We are asking for immediate assistance to locate the megaship and provide whatever support may be needed. »

The Federation responded by cancelling the temporary permit restriction to the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system for all vessels except fleet carriers. This permit was arranged at the request of Congressman Dalton Chase, who played a key role in procuring the Kingfisher megaship for use by TAP volunteers. With access to the system reinstated, Federal investigators have been despatched to assess the situation.

Observers have confirmed that the Taranis anomaly passed through Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 at faster-than-light speed. As with the other rogue signal sources, Taranis continues to move towards the core systems.


* Xeno-Peace Supporters Killed by Thargoids
Investigations in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system have confirmed that Thargoid vessels attacked and destroyed the Kingfisher megaship.

Vox Galactica published this on-the-scene report from field correspondent Ernesto Rios:

« Independent and Federal sources have verified that the Kingfisher was struck by multiple barrages from Thargoid weaponry. Medical teams are currently exploring the wreckage of the megaship in search of crew and passengers. Sadly, from what I've seen, the scale of the damage suggests that the chances of survival are extremely low. »

« Further confirmation came with the discovery of a log made by Dr Elias Pope of Orion University, who was overseeing attempts to communicate with the Thargoids. Although I have yet to hear this recording myself, it apparently describes exactly what happened when the Taranis anomaly passed through the system. »

« As news of the tragedy spreads, it has triggered a vociferous backlash against the Thargoid Advocacy Project. This fringe group recently gained a degree of respectability with the involvement of Congressman Dalton Chase and other media figures. But now there is widespread anger that, as Sol Today's editorial put it, 'Thousands of people were sent to die based on a vague hope that these alien warmongers might suddenly play nice.' »

« Congressman Chase himself told the press that he is reviewing the latest reports from Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1, and cannot yet make any official comment. As the public face of the Kingfisher mission, it's likely that any formal demands for accountability will be directed his way. »

« Meanwhile, Taranis draws ever closer to human-inhabited space. The Kingfisher's destruction proves definitively that the rogue signal sources are of Thargoid origin, and that their intentions are hostile. With the prospect of the Second Thargoid War escalating to new levels, tensions throughout the core systems have never been higher. »


* Militaries on Alert as Taranis Approaches
The Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system has been identified as the location where the rogue signal source named Taranis will finally arrive.

Professor Ishmael Palin gave a statement to confirm the findings of several scientific groups:

« Data correlated from many long-range scans proves that the anomaly's velocity is reducing steadily. At its present rate of descent, Taranis will arrive at Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 in approximately 24 hours. I have sent a research team, led by my colleague Dr Leroux, to gather data on its arrival. »

Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy commented:

« Fortunately, this particular system is uninhabited so no populations are directly at risk. We are monitoring the situation rather than deploying capital ships. Civilian traffic is ordered not to enter Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 until we know more about Taranis's capabilities. »

The Alliance Defence Force issued a similar announcement from Admiral Rachel Ziegler:

« The Thargoids' overall strategy remains unknown, as does the true nature of these rogue signal sources. But there is certainly no reason to place ourselves in their path intentionally. It's possible that, as with HIP 22460, the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system could become a no-go zone occupied by an overwhelming number of Thargoid vessels. »

Despite making no official statement, it is believed that the Imperial Navy is likewise holding back from deploying a military fleet to the Taranis anomaly. Independent analysts have suggested that the destruction of the Kingfisher megaship in Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 has contributed to the superpowers' caution, with capital ship losses in HIP 22460 also fresh in the memory.


* Vista Genomics Boosts Biodata Payouts
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The exobiology company Vista Genomics has increased payments for genetic data collected by independent pilots.

Dr Klaus-Peter Sonnek , one of the corporation's research directors, outlined the changes in a press release:

« Public and corporate interest in xenology-related fields remains high, but recent Thargoid aggression has increased the risk in collecting of such data. Vista Genomics is well-placed to incentivise the continued collection of samples. Therefore, we can officially confirm that substantially improved financial rewards will be offered for all genetic data submitted via our outlets. »

« We are also aware of many civil and military projects focusing on the Thargoids, a species that makes extensive use of biomechanical technology. There is enormous value in gathering as much exobiology data as possible to provide comparative baselines for anti-xeno research efforts. »

Commanders can use the Genetic Sampler tool to acquire genetic data from various species of alien flora found on planetary surfaces. This can be sold on the concourses of ports, megaships and fleet carriers which have an active Vista Genomics vendor.

In other news, Sirius Corporation has announced that its popular modified heatsinks and anti-xeno missile rack have been made available to pilots via its company tech brokers. Active Sirius Corporation megaships \u2013 Chariot of Rhea, El Centinela Cadejo, Kumiho Sky, Spirit of Laelaps and The Witness Odysseus \u2013 now host Sirius tech brokers on board.


* Taranis Unleashes Thargoid Invasion Fleets
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Taranis anomaly has arrived in Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6, triggering a ferocious wave of Thargoid attacks in the region.

Multiple inhabited systems are experiencing wide-scale invasions by countless numbers of Thargoid vessels, with casualties expected to number millions in the coming days. Several systems have already reported a complete loss of human control, with ports abandoned amid heavy losses.

The Alliance Defence Force and Federal Navy have responded by sending capital ships, which will support independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. Neither superpower has entered the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system, from which the Thargoid fleets seem to be emanating.

There have been conflicting descriptions of the rogue signal source itself, which finally slowed to a halt after weeks of faster-than-light travel. Dr Remy Leroux, a xenologist working for Professor Palin, transmitted a garbled report describing Taranis as « not a single object but a colossal swirling maelstrom of some kind », before all contact was lost.

These initial reports have not been verified, and many authorities consider them to be unreliable or exaggerated. However, warnings have been issued that the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.

Speaking to The Alliance Tribune, Admiral Rachel Ziegler remarked: « Our focus at present is on defending the populated systems from swarms of highly aggressive Thargoids. Whatever this 'maelstrom' actually is, it's clearly been sent with the purpose of eradicating human influence in the region. »


* Havoc as Thargoids Overrun Multiple Systems
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Nine systems have called for help against massive Thargoid attacks intent on wiping out civilian populations.

Ernesto Rios, field correspondent for Vox Galactica, reported:

« The arrival of what military scientists have labelled the 'Taranis Maelstrom' has brought terror and carnage to millions. As soon as the rogue signal source arrived, local inhabited systems became flooded with enormous numbers of Thargoid vessels. Six populated systems close to Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 were rapidly overwhelmed, while another nine systems in the region are currently facing full-scale invasions. »

« I've travelled between several of these systems, and seen for myself the horrific loss of life. Starports are ablaze and covered with corrosive enzymes. Planetary infrastructure is crumbling under the Thargoids' tremendous firepower. Passing ships are being wrenched out of hyperspace. These attacks seem more merciless than ever before, as if the aliens are determined to eliminate every human population structure they detect. »

« Rescue megaships have been established at a safe distance from the invasion's current front line, facilitating mass evacuation of civilians. These vessels will also stock anti-xeno weaponry for independent pilots seeking to assist the defence efforts or protect themselves while transporting refugees. »

« Both President Hudson and Prime Minister Mahon have declared a major emergency, ordering Federal and Allied capital ships to engage the Thargoids. Senator Patreus has dispatched an Imperial Navy force to the Modigi system to defend its territory from Thargoid attack. »

« The Taranis Maelstrom itself is the target of intense study, although patrolling Thargoids in the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system make scientific analysis hazardous. Professor Palin and Ram Tah have both warned that this enormous entity appears to have a protective 'cloud' of unknown composition, which is proving dangerous to ships that approach it. »

« With the other seven rogue signal sources racing toward the core systems, militaries and security forces are preparing for the worst. Will the other seven rogue signal sources bring similar terror? And is humanity capable of withstanding an onslaught of this magnitude? »


* New Maelstroms Increase Thargoid Conquests
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Two more rogue signal sources have reached human space, wreaking similar destruction to the Taranis Maelstrom.

The Indra anomaly arrived in the HIP 20567 system, with the Leigong anomaly slowing to a halt in HIP 8887. The Maelstroms, as these entities have been classified, both manifested as enormous gaseous clouds. These are known to be extremely hazardous to any ship venturing too close, but the nature of what lies within remains unknown.

As with Taranis, each new Maelstrom pre-empted staggering numbers of Thargoid vessels flooding nearby populated systems. Recent reports indicate that the alien fleets have completely dominated 9 systems in proximity to HIP 20567 and none close to HIP 8887. Starports, settlements and outposts have all been devastated or abandoned, with the total number of casualties unknown but feared considerable.

A total of 16 systems are currently facing active Thargoid invasions and are transmitting emergency calls for assistance. Rescue megaships have been designated as the gateway destination for refugees. The superpowers have also positioned anti-xeno capital ships to defend Allied, Federal and Imperial territories that have been invaded.

Public media channels have expressed grave concerns about the remaining rogue signal sources, which are en route to the core systems. It is expected that these will establish five more Maelstroms, each generating a new wave of Thargoid forces. With the combined death toll rapidly climbing, civil and military authorities alike are scrambling to implement a suitable response.


* Refugees Flee from Thargoid Offensive
Millions of people are being evacuated from systems that have suffered devastating attacks by Thargoid fleets.

An enormous humanitarian effort is underway, with rescue megaships positioned at key locations near each Thargoid-occupied system. Captain Justine Kemp  of Rescue Ship Hutner, currently stationed in Enayex, described their operations to Vox Galactica:

« As per newly established procedures, all contracted transports carrying refugees from systems facing Thargoid invasion are directed to our landing bays. Emergency teams perform triage services and give direct aid where possible. But the focus is on quickly processing them for relocation to temporary housing, away from the warzones. »

« This is the most intense situation I've ever had to deal with. We're taking in enormous numbers of people, not just from starports but from planetary settlements too. Virtually everything in some of these systems is ablaze, and the refugees just keep coming. »

Vox Galactica also published a selection of soundbites from various civilians escaping from Thargoid-occupied systems:

« It all happened so fast. Our family was eating together when the whole port seemed to shake. My son had befriended a trader who'd landed a few days ago, and he convinced her to take us on board her Hauler. The lurches as we weaved through Thargoid ships almost made me bring up the food we'd been enjoying minutes earlier. »

« I was at a starport observation window when their ships, those weird star-shaped things, zipped right past. Then the other side of the habitat ring just vanished. Fire and splinters of metal... All the sirens blared, and the crowds surged toward the bays. Heat filled the corridors and smoke clogged our lungs. I didn't even see the ship I ended up on, only a sea of panicked faces smeared with grime. »

« I'm looking for my dad. He was injured when I last saw him. Burns from that green corrosive stuff that punched through our quarters. The Commander didn't have room on his ship for everyone. I convinced him to take my dad first. But now I can't find him. The medics don't have time to talk to me. I hope he's here somewhere. He's got to be here somewhere. »


* Plans for Enhanced AX Weaponry Accelerate
Two leading engineers have revealed designs to improve the stock anti-xeno weaponry available to pilots.

Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have provided module modifications for many years, specialising in explosive and kinetic weapons respectively. Over the past year they have collaborated privately on the AX weapon designs introduce by Aegis in 3303, seeking to improve the efficiency of delivering a compound, hazardous to Thargoid vessels, which tips AX ammunition.

While something of a pet project between the two, the recent invasion of human space by Thargoid forces has made the need for these designs far more urgent. Ryder explained to The Imperial Herald:

« Zac and I share a passion for weapon upgrades, and have often used this project as a way to unwind after a long week's work. He's a weird guy but fascinating to work with. But when the Taranis signal arrived and the Thargoid forces started taking control of systems, we knew we had to reveal the designs to the public. »

« They're not quite ready to go, though, which is why we're only announcing the project now. We're going to need help from independent pilots to finish off the prototypes and get a manufacturing base set up. »

The designs would improve the effectiveness of both the fixed and turreted AX multi-cannon and missile rack designs. A gimballed AX multi-cannon is also scheduled, with a campaign to introduce this coming next week.

Details about each weapon's project is available from most mission boards.


* Chase Admits Kingfisher Mission 'A Mistake'
Congressman Dalton Chase has made a public statement regretting his involvement with the Thargoid Advocacy Project.

Chase became a member of Congress after an electoral campaign focusing on inter-species diplomatic relations. He was a key organiser and fundraiser for the Kingfisher megaship, which attempted to open communications with the Taranis entity but was subsequently destroyed with no survivors.

In a press statement delivered from Olympus Village on Mars, Congressman Chase announced:

« The tragic fate that befell the Kingfisher has affected me deeply. I now recognise that sourcing the means for those activists to intercept Taranis was, however well intentioned, a mistake. Such an endeavour should not have been attempted by inexperienced citizens, no matter their courage and tenacity. »

« In honour of those brave people, I pledge to focus on proposals to introduce xeno-diplomacy as Federal policy. Rather than civilians needing to risk their lives, we should be bringing such operations to the Federal Navy at a congressional level. »

Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has petitioned Congress to launch an investigation into Chase's involvement with the xeno-peace movement. She described his role in the loss of over 3,000 lives as « beyond reckless ».

Although the Thargoid Advocacy Project has faltered following the Kingfisher incident, some of its core members were recently involved in organising anti-authoritarian rallies. According to former spokesperson Timothy Culver:

« The superpowers' involvement in the massacre at HIP 22460, when they supported Salvation's attempted xenocide, makes them responsible for the Thargoids launching this counterstrike. We need to bring our leaders to account. »


* Carnage Wrought by Further Maelstroms
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The rogue signal sources Cocijo and Oya have arrived at their estimated destinations.

Their impact mirrored that of the Taranis, Indra and Leigong Maelstroms. A total of 16 neighbouring systems were immediately overwhelmed by Thargoid fleets, which launched devastating bombardments against orbital starports and planetary infrastructure.

Other inhabited systems in the vicinity are resisting occupation. Superpower capital ships and independent pilots are currently battling to protect the local populations.

Five rogue signal sources have now manifested as Maelstroms, with three more approaching at faster-than-light speed. Many systems have completely fallen to the Thargoids in the vicinity of each Maelstrom. Safeguard Interstellar reported that millions of refugees are threatening to overwhelm emergency services and rescue teams. Military forces are also struggling to contain the enormous numbers of Thargoid vessels.

Professor Alba Tesreau is one of many xenologists and other specialists trying to learn more about the mysterious Maelstroms. She gave a brief update to Vox Galactica:

« Full-scale war with the Thargoids has always been my greatest fear. It is now a reality. It's more crucial than ever that we obtain an understanding of this species, particularly these powerful new entities deployed against humanity. »

« Seo Jin-ae, who possesses a base comprehension of Thargoid intent via her neural implants, believes these are focused, systematic strikes rather than a frenzied assault. She feels that the Thargoids are working toward a specific goal, but cannot yet identify its nature. »

« The one advantage given to us by the arrival of further Maelstroms is the potential that Thargoid forces will be distributed more evenly across systems. With an expanded front line, defensive efforts may gain additional traction when defending or recapturing systems from the aliens. »

In related news, Azimuth Biotech's new anti-xeno megaship has entered service in the T Tauri system. Eternal Vigilance was commissioned following an initiative in November, which was challenged by a counter-campaign aiming to prevent the corporation's resurgence.


* The Darkest Days
Newsfeeds have published their reactions as the Thargoid Maelstroms launch fleets to overpower multiple inhabited systems.

Sol Today: « Be in no doubt: we are in a war for survival! Dark days are upon us. No more ridiculous ideas of peace with the aliens. No more time for politics or debate. The Thargoids have come to wipe us out unless we stand up and fight. »

Old Worlds Gazette: « This is the most severe Thargoid attack ever recorded. Hundreds of thousands slaughtered. Millions more fleeing their homes. Stations and planetary ports bombarded, entire star systems conquered\u2026 all in a few days. Many fear that nowhere will be safe if these savage onslaughts cannot be halted. »

Citizens' Chronicle: « The speed with which our navy responded to defend Imperial citizens against the Thargoids must be applauded. However, it is becoming harder to ignore the screams from less fortunate systems. Might their cries melt our Emperor's heart enough for her to consider extending the Empire's protective wings? »

The Empirical: « The hazardous nature of the Maelstroms has challenged all efforts at scientific examination. In terms of scale and composition they resemble small nebulae yet are surely artificial. Their highly corrosive clouds share chemical signatures with known Thargoid technology, but prevent all scans from identifying what generates them. »

The Sovereign: « The Kingfisher tragedy has been eclipsed by the current conflicts, but one detail we felt worthy of note was the discovery of Thargoid Sensors among the megaship's wreckage. The leading theory is that one of the volunteer crewmembers smuggled these aboard, in the hope of attracting the Thargoids' attention to the megaship's peaceful communications. This misguided individual was likely unaware that Thargoid vessels can become hostile upon detecting their technology on human ships. One hopes that nothing more sinister was in play. »


* Enhanced AX Weapon Update
Pilots' Federation ALERT

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update.

Independent pilots have been tasked with establishing a manufacturing base at select locations in the core systems. Thanks to these focused efforts, the following weapons are now available for purchase:

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Turreted)

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Turreted)

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Fixed)

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.

Work continues on the other enhanced weapons, based on designs by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo which improve the original Aegis models. A further update will be provided next Thursday, unless no additional modules have been established during the week.


* Corrs Toy Emporium Calls for Help
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Sandra Corrs, CEO of the largest manufacturer of children's toys in the core systems, has requested help this holiday season.

Many parents will be familiar with Sandra's Workshop, recognising the company logo stamped across countless datapads, interactive suites and tactile play sets designed for youngsters. But the joy of this year's festive season is at risk, with the recent Thargoid invasion impacting the Workshop's distribution chain.

In an interview with Vox Galactica, Corrs explained:

« We typically use a fleet of transports provided by our partner company, Dolph's Routes, to deliver presents to good children all across the bubble. But those transports have been assigned to provide evacuation support to 63 Tauri. Entirely understandable, and I applaud the company for its brave work. But it does leave many presents without a sleigh, as my grandfather used to say! »

« I'm hoping that independent pilots will fill the vacancy left to deliver festive gifts to the children in time for the upcoming holidays. Arrangements will be made to provide a variety of wonderful rewards for those pilots who help keep youthful spirits high in these troubling times. »

Pilots willing to help Sandra's Workshop can collect festive gifts from the Frost Dock outpost in the Njambalba system. A beacon outside Frost Dock will distribute delivery information when scanned.


* Final Maelstroms Advance Thargoid Occupation
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A further 13 systems have fallen under Thargoid control as the last of the Maelstroms materialise.

The three rogue signal sources \u2013 designated Thor, Raijin and Hadad \u2013 entered human-occupied space yesterday. As with the previous five anomalies, they manifested as colossal clouds of corrosive gas over 100 kilometres in diameter.

Pilots who attempt to investigate the Maelstroms have been warned that the highly caustic nature of the clouds can disable and destroy ships. Xenologists have speculated that the cloud is a defensive asset, maintained by the huge numbers of caustic generators clustered within.

All eight Maelstroms are now established at their destinations, positioned in a broad semi-circle along the fringe of the core systems. Each of these entities has become the centre of an expanding Thargoid sphere of influence. Populated systems in the surrounding regions have been dominated by extremely hostile Thargoid vessels, causing enormous casualties and catastrophic damage. Many more inhabited systems are at risk of invasion.

Eleven rescue megaships have entered service at key locations to aid and process the millions of refugees fleeing these attacks. These ships also act as hubs for defence operations to support those systems struggling to resist the Thargoid fleets.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have deployed capital ships equipped with anti-xeno weaponry to defend their respective territories. As yet there appears to be no technology or strategy capable of engaging the ominous power of the Maelstroms directly.


* The Supercruise Factor
Thargoid vessels are interdicting human ships travelling through systems that have been occupied by their fleets.

The Thargoids' ability to force craft to drop out of hyperspace is well documented. Over the past couple of weeks, pilots have reported that the interdiction ability used by human ships in supercruise is also being utilised by the alien forces.

Colonel Bris Dekker, an engineer who specialises in frame shift drive technology, submitted his analysis to The Federal Times:

« Being intercepted by the Thargoids mid-way through an interstellar journey is certainly a disturbing experience, but not necessarily a fatal one. Many ships have survived such encounters, unless they happen to be carrying Guardian or Thargoid artefacts. By contrast, these more recent incidents are uniformly acts of aggression, with ships being wrenched out of supercruise and immediately fired upon. »

« We don't know precisely how the Thargoids achieve this, though some theories are gathering support. But the intention is clear: to make the hunting of humans vessels easier. Anti-xeno pilots should note that they can no longer escape the Thargoid blasting though their shields by simply entering supercruise. »

« Possibly, this is more of a shift in tactics than a new technological development. All reported interdictions have taken place in recently invaded systems close to the Maelstroms, rather than in the aliens' more well-known haunts. Whatever the reason, the invading Thargoid force has adapted to more efficiently catch its prey. »


* The Voice of the Empire
On the Empire's homeworld Capitol, fears over imminent Thargoid invasion sparked a public gathering outside the Imperial Palace.

Cassia Carvalho, political journalist for The Imperial Herald, reported from the scene:

« The arrival of the Thargoid Maelstroms has triggered protests on many Allied, Federal and independent worlds. The Empire is rarely troubled by such disruption, so the spontaneous march by tens of thousands of citizens through Capitol's streets caught the media and security services by surprise. »

« Chancellor Anders Blaine addressed the crowd, his image projected above us all. He spoke of the Imperial Navy's swift response to the Thargoid threat, making assurances that our systems were protected and we were all safe. »

« But this wasn't enough to quell the increasingly strident demands that more should be done. I saw anger, frustration and fear etched into those shouting faces. The newsfeed images of burning and broken starports, of Thargoid vessels laying waste to ordinary people's homes, were all too clear in everyone's minds. »

« I genuinely wasn't sure which way this impromptu demonstration would go. Might the crowd's strong emotions even transmute into violence? And then a new voice rang out across the square: the unmistakable tones of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval herself, standing tall as she slowly descended the palace steps toward us. »

« 'Remember this: we are Imperials,' she told her people, her commanding voice amplified for all to hear. The crowd parted in silence as she neared, allowing her to stride amongst us. 'We possess the strongest civilisation, the grandest achievements, and the most courageous hearts. We shall meet anything that dares to threaten us, human or alien, and we will defeat it. Our Empire will endure! »

« By the end of her address, which lasted some ten minutes, emotions had indeed been transmuted \u2013 into exultant, cheering jubilation. Our Emperor had stood with us in person, reminded us all of our heritage and our duty. The Thargoids will undoubtedly come. But in that moment we were determined to face them together. »


* Winters: 'Federation Must Protect Independents'
Shadow President Felicia Winters has called for the Federal Navy to help defend independent systems being invaded by the Thargoids.

She outlined her viewpoint during an interview with the Federal Free Press:

« The Thargoid fleets emerging from the Maelstroms have inflicted anguish and loss on millions. Our military forces have responded magnificently, and continue to fight hard against appalling odds. But while they are saving lives in Federal-aligned systems, independent systems are left to suffer. »

« Surely this cannot be right? These are our neighbours, our trading partners, our historic cousins. Their populations cry out for help, and the mighty Federal Navy chooses to ignore them, claiming orders to prioritise saving our own. Is that who we are now? No better than the Empire? »

« I have argued in Congress that we have a duty of responsibility to protect any independent systems lacking the ability to defend themselves from Thargoid attacks. The Federal Navy's resources are finite, I understand that. But we are fighting to determine the future of the human race. We lack proof that the Thargoids have any concept of our politics, borders or allegiances. Why would they care which systems claim allegiance to whom? Every one of us is a target. »

« And for those whose hearts are hardened to the suffering of others, think on this: the threat is moving closer each day. Leaving non-Federal factions to fend for themselves \u2013 and most likely become conquered \u2013 will only hasten the Thargoids' advance. Before long, nowhere within the Federation will be safe. We will all pay the price for such callousness. »


* The Time for Aegis?
Professor Alba Tesreau has again called for the anti-xeno initiative Aegis to be reformed by the superpowers.

« The arrival of the Maelstroms has escalated the Second Thargoid War beyond anything we have experienced before. The Thargoids are relentlessly attacking every human settlement within reach. And that reach is steadily expanding on eight fronts, spreading deeper into the core systems. »

« In these dire circumstances, the decision to shut down Aegis seems to be a grave mistake. Now, more than ever, superpower-level resources are needed to establish large-scale research and defence projects. This is the surely the time for Aegis to be revived with as much funding and resources as possible. »

« My symposium in October proved that there is an increasing appetite for collaboration. Many Allied and Federal military leaders have already discussed working together. Shadow President Winters recently suggested helping those beyond Federal borders, and Deputy Prime Minister Corcoran has championed the prospect of coalition in the Alliance. »

« Sadly, the Empire's current isolationist policy means that Aegis would necessitate a return as a dual-superpower initiative. But even that would be an improvement on the fractured, uncoordinated response to the Thargoid conquests. »

There has been no official response to Professor Tesreau from the Alliance or Federation, but several individual congressmen and council members have repeated their support for the reformation of Aegis.

In the Empire, only the Citizens' Chronicle newsfeed reported on Tesreau's ongoing campaign, commenting: « Even among the Imperial nobility, few dare to question the Emperor's decree. But those few are growing bolder. »


* Enhanced AX Weapon Update
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update.

All enhanced AX weapons designed by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have now been completed. It is hoped that with these weapons improvements, humanity will be better positioned to defend itself against Thargoid invasion fleets.

The following weapons are now available for purchase:

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Gimballed)

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Fixed)

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.


* A Retrospective of 3308 (Part Two)
Sima Kalhana continues her review of the most significant historical events that occurred during the past year.

« In May 3308, the Thargoid invasions of the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems were completely repelled by the use of Salvation's unique superweapons. This convinced the Alliance, Empire and Federation to support Azimuth Biotech in developing this Guardian-based technology, with Salvation claiming that he could end the Thargoid threat forever. »

« Elsewhere that month, the Kumo Crew syndicate faced civil war as pirate rebels tried to replace Archon Delaine. Eventually his loyal forces triumphed, with the Blue Viper Club dredger clan fleeing his reprisals. And in the Federation, trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham announced his presidential candidacy for the 3309 election. »

« June saw the Golconda generation ship repaired and updated by the Artificers Clan. This provided the majority of its original inhabitants, descended from Earth colonists, the opportunity to resume their spacefaring lifestyle. »

« The news around this time was dominated by Salvation, particularly when he rebranded Taurus Mining Ventures as Azimuth Biotech. The scientist, once named Dr Caleb Wycherley, admitted that the corporation had evolved out of the notorious Azimuth Biochemicals. But Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders chose to ignore this, having pinned their anti-xeno strategy on Salvation's superweapon technology. »

« HIP 22460 was the system chosen to construct the Proteus Wave. This interfaced Guardian technology with a Thargoid ground settlement, and was designed to deliberately attract the Thargoids before wiping them out. During July and August, upgraded capital ships along with independent pilots defended Azimuth Biotech's operation from swarms of Thargoid vessels. »

« After weeks of intense combat and delivering vital supplies, the Proteus Wave was activated on 9th August. Initially it seemed successful, rendering the Thargoids powerless, but an unexpected second energy pulse from the planetary site had the same effect on all human ships. The resulting massacre saw the Thargoids take control of the HIP 22460 system, establishing a permanent presence. »

« Salvation was dead. Azimuth Biotech's plans had failed. The superpowers were in retreat. And speculation grew about an unearthly alien screech heard in HIP 22460, dubbed the 'Thargoid roar'. »


* A Retrospective of 3308 (Part Three)
The concluding article in a series by historian Sima Kalhana, providing an overview of last year's key events.

« The aftermath of the Battle of HIP 22460 was an unsettling time. With Salvation dead, Azimuth Biotech fell under new management and struggled to maintain prominence. The Empire withdrew from further collaborations with the other superpowers. And despite widespread fears of Thargoid reprisals, a xeno-peace movement sought diplomacy with the aliens to prevent further conflict. »

« September brought further mysteries with sightings of eight swirling anomalies in deep space, detectable by ship scanners within a certain range. Initially assumed to be stellar phenomena, these rogue signal sources were later discovered to be travelling faster than light. »

« Professor Alba Tesreau continued to call for Aegis to be reinstated, and held a symposium in October to outline her plans. This was gatecrashed by a woman named Seo Jin-ae, formerly Subject D-2 in Azimuth's notorious Project Seraph experiments. Her neural link to a Thargoid vessel provided a degree of insight into the aliens' behaviour. With Tesreau's help, she later claimed the rogue signal sources were of Thargoid origin, summoned in response to events in HIP 22460. »

« The Far God cult was overjoyed by the Thargoids' recent victory, but its radical True Chapters sect was accused of sharing classified media from HIP 22460 which included the 'Thargoid roar'. The Federation outlawed the religion, forcing the True Chapters megaships to flee. »

« By November, it was confirmed that all eight rogue signal sources were approaching the core systems. Congressman Dalton Chase arranged for the xeno-peace movement to outfit the Kingfisher megaship, which was sent to meet and communicate with one of the so-called 'stargoids'. It was swiftly destroyed, establishing a grim prelude for the bloodshed to follow. »

« Taranis, the first of the anomalies, arrived in Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 on 29th November, manifesting as a colossal gas cloud. This Maelstrom immediately unleashed vast numbers of Thargoid vessels into neighbouring systems, ferociously attacking all orbital and planet-based habitats. »

« The remaining seven Maelstroms arrived during December, empowering the Thargoids to invade and conquer systems. Superpower militaries, anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots rushed to their defence, but were clearly unprepared for an onslaught of such magnitude. »

« By the end of 3308, Thargoid forces were raging across the core systems, causing millions of casualties and displacing millions more from their homes. The cataclysmic events of the past year have cast a chilling shadow over the future, with only one certainty: that 3309 will be dominated by the Second Thargoid War. »


* Azimuth Conducts AX Weapons Research
The corporation Azimuth Biotech has outlined its plans to support the war effort against the Thargoids by improving ship anti-xeno firepower.

CEO Torben Rademaker was interviewed on The Tau Ceti Journal's official ICE-cast, where he explained:

« As you may recall, one of the many reasons Aegis became redundant was its poor record in improving AX armaments past the initial rush of designs. Azimuth Biotech has established a research and development division specifically designed to correct their failings at a steady, sustainable pace. »

« One of the inherent limitations with Aegis's designs is the maximum number of AX weapons that a ship can be outfitted with. The enhanced versions based on Ryder and Nemo's designs share this limitation. We seek to increase the upper limit of AX weapons a ship can utilise, and our research teams are already reporting promising results. »

One of the ICE-cast's interactive audience questions asked why Azimuth was not working with Proteus Wave technology to build more anti-xeno superweapons. Rademaker replied:

« Under my guidance, the corporation has moved away from Salvation's esoteric field of research and adopted a more conventional direction. It seems clear to me that the superweapon project led by my predecessor was, ultimately, a failure. »

Rademaker also answered an accusation that Azimuth was responsible for the loss of life in HIP 22460, and that he should face trial for 'causing the Thargoid Maelstroms':

« Sadly, I often come across such simplistic blame-seeking from those with limited comprehension of the issue. The plain fact is that nobody could have predicted the Thargoids' excessive reaction to our activities in HIP 22460. The Proteus Wave was deemed an acceptable means of ending the war, approved by individuals with far more military experience than Salvation could claim. »

Rademaker's only response to a subsequent barrage of abuse from a member of Operation Wych-Hunt was less verbose. The interview feed was terminated.


* Subject D-2 Departs on Lone Mission
Mystery surrounds the unexpected disappearance of Seo Jin-ae, who has reportedly departed the facility she'd been staying at.

Professor Alba Tesreau provided a statement to the media:

« Seo Jin-ae's mental and physical health have improved over the past three months, with the discomfort caused by her cortical implant significantly reduced. This afternoon, I learned that she failed to attend a routine therapy appointment, and was soon found to have left the facility altogether. Somehow Seo managed to depart without logging her ID at the primary entry point. »

« Initially I feared that she had been abducted by Azimuth operatives, sent by the company which subjected her to horrific neurosurgical procedures. But I soon received a time-delayed communiqu\u00e9 from Seo explaining her departure was voluntary. She offered heartfelt thanks to me and other former Aegis members for our help, but declared: 'I have unfinished business with Salvation.' »

« I don't know what this refers to, since Salvation died in HIP 22460. Seo is a headstrong and determined individual who clearly prefers operating alone. I believe she should not be travelling without protection, though. Her ability to interpret the Thargoids' actions could make her a target for those who mean her harm. I urge anyone who encounters her to alert local authorities. »

Azimuth Biotech offered a response from Director Nassim Qadir , head of the corporation's medical research division:

« This erratic activity from Ms Seo displays typical characteristics of delusion and paranoid obsession with Salvation, whose death has been confirmed by eyewitness reports. We must question what type of 'medical help' she has been subjected to, if it forced her to abscond in this fashion. She would receive far more effective therapeutic care at our facilities. »


* Admiral Tanner Receives Presidential Pardon
The court martial verdict of Admiral Aden Tanner has been officially overturned by an executive order from President Zachary Hudson.

In November 3307, Tanner attempted to take control of Hind Mine starport while in command of the Musashi megaship. He claimed that databanks at the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures \u2013 as Azimuth Biotech was then known \u2013 contained evidence that Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons were designed to attract the Thargoids into populated systems before they were deployed.

A legal review last September, after the Proteus Wave was used to entice Thargoids to HIP 22460, substantiated Tanner's claims. His sentence was commuted to time served, but his dishonourable discharge was upheld. This granting of clemency by President Hudson quashes the convictions of mutiny and unlawful military action.

The Office of the Federal President published the following:

« Aden Tanner has an impressive and honourable record of service to the Federation, including a key role as chief military liaison to Aegis. His brief violation of protocol has since been accepted as based on sound intelligence. President Hudson therefore believes that Tanner's in-depth experience in combating Thargoid forces is too valuable to disregard, considering the current situation. »

A brief statement was also made by Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori:

« I fully support this presidential pardon, which is in the best interests of all citizens. Admiral Tanner has been formally reinstated and is already being briefed on strategic plans regarding the Thargoids. »

« I'd like to stress that I believe the Federal Navy Criminal Court's original verdict was just and fair, given all available information at the time. This executive action does not undermine the court's crucial role in maintaining order among enlisted personnel. »


* Azimuth Announces Experimental Weapons Stabiliser
Azimuth Biotech has revealed prototypes of a module which improves hardpoint capacity for AX ships at the TZ Arietis Weapon Expo.

The event showcased a range of military products to entice governments, corporations and private groups into contracts with arms suppliers. But the current demand for anti-xeno weaponry meant that Azimuth Biotech's announcement gained the greatest media attention.

CEO Torben Rademaker delivered a presentation on the expo's main stage:

« Azimuth's experimental weapons stabiliser is designed to redistribute the physical stresses that experimental modules place upon a ship's structural integrity. Its unique technology will allow ships to utilise AX weapons above the current limit of four, expanding a pilots' options when engaging Thargoid vessels. »

« The medium variant of our stabiliser allows one additional experimental weapon to be installed, while the large variant can facilitate two additional experimental weapons. Both stabilisers support the enhanced AX missile racks and multi-cannons that recently became available. »

« While I have your attention, I'd like to add that Azimuth utterly condemns the recent pardon of the war criminal Aden Tanner. It is shocking that Aegis's unprovoked attack against our headquarters at Hind Mine could be glossed over so easily. We have informed the Federation that Azimuth has no intention of relinquishing our ownership of the Musashi, the megaship commanded by Tanner during his failed attempt to steal company assets. »

During the weapons expo, Azimuth Biotech made successful deals to commercially manufacture its experimental weapons stabilisers. An initiative is being planned to acquire the raw materials needed to establish mass production.


* Princess Aisling Echoes Aegis Reformation Calls
Princess Aisling Duval has publicly asked Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to reconsider pledging Imperial resources to a cross-superpower anti-xeno initiative.

Her message was shared on all Imperial newsfeeds:

« The Empire's capability to defend itself is not in question. But neither is there any doubt that we are facing a protracted war. The ferocity and scale of the Thargoid onslaught on human space is unprecedented. Of course the Empire will survive, as it has for over a millennium\u2026 but at what cost? How many systems must fall? How many citizens will grieve for lost loved ones? »

« Emperor Arissa, I implore you: work with the Alliance and Federation to reform Aegis. Our combined resources are needed to develop new technologies to overcome the alien armadas. Corporate interests must not dictate this path. Let Imperial ingenuity and courage light the way to victory over a common enemy. »

A handful of senators supported Princess Aisling's plea initially, though others have criticised her for daring to challenge the Emperor's decree. As yet there has been no response from the Imperial Palace.

Gudrun Vestergaard , royal correspondent for The Imperial Herald, commented:

« There is speculation that this may cause friction between Aisling and her cousin Hadrian Duval, whose long-held isolationist beliefs are now aligned with Imperial policy. Until now both have enjoyed a close relationship, with Aisling even being chosen as honour-mother to Hadrian's baby son Hector. But their views on Imperial foreign policy could not be more different, and recent events have brought this into sharp focus. »


* Experimental Weapon Stabiliser Initiative Begins
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has requested deliveries to LHS 1163 to manufacture a module that increases AX weapons capacity.

A press release from the corporation's PR division stated:

« Azimuth's dedication to defeating the Thargoids, which stretches back more than a century, has reached a new milestone with the development of our experimental weapon stabiliser. »

« This proprietary invention redistributes the physical stresses that AX weapons place upon a ship's infrastructure. The class 3 and class 5 variants allow ships to be outfitted with one or two additional AX weapons respectively. »

« Supplies of meta-alloys, insulating membranes, HN shock mounts and beryllium are required to begin mass production of our successful prototypes. All shipments should be delivered to the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 1163 system. Sufficient resources will allow the class 3 variant of the experimental weapon stabiliser to become available immediately, with the class 5 variant reaching the market a short time later. »

The opportunity to increase hardpoint capacity for anti-xeno combat ships has been broadly welcomed. But critics have noted that Azimuth Biotech stands to commercially benefit from this contribution  to the conflict, which many believe was triggered by its Proteus Wave operation in the HIP 22460 system.

A spokesperson for Operation Wych Hunt, an independent community established to oppose Azimuth Biotech, offered this statement:

\The proposed modules will benefit humanity in the fight against the ongoing Thargoid threat and we support anybody who takes advantage of them. But this does not absolve Azimuth Biotech of the terrible acts that they committed under the leadership of Caleb Wycherley. The company still must be held accountable for the many atrocities it has committed, including the inhumane experiments of Project Seraph and the vile murder of thousands onboard the Alexandria.\


* Thargoid War Update: January 3309
Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn has published a summary of the current situation in the conflict against the Thargoids.

« Many of us who witnessed those terrifying events in HIP 22460 felt that it was both an ending and a beginning \u2013 that history had turned a page. Five months later, the Second Thargoid War has escalated to a point which may yet close the book altogether. »

« The arrival of the eight Maelstroms resulted in 44 populated systems being completely overwhelmed by the Thargoids. Dozens of neighbouring regions were also attacked by their fleets, leaving starports and settlements ablaze. Billions were killed and billions more fled from their homes as panicked refugees, creating the greatest humanitarian crisis of all time. »

« Despite the lack of coordination previously provided by Aegis and Salvation, anti-xeno efforts have been herculean. Allied, Federal and Imperial warships rapidly responded to form a vanguard against the invaders, and thousands of independent pilots have valiantly fought the Thargoid swarms across multiple battlefields. »

« Military experts believe that neutralising the Maelstroms will stem the endless waves of Thargoid vessels. Unfortunately, their caustic clouds and repulsing energy waves prevent our ships from exploring whatever resides within. They also generate the same disruptive field found in HIP 22460, which prevents any Guardian-based weapons from functioning within the system. »

« But there is hope. A small but steady flow of unclassified relics, those strange artefacts recovered from Thargoid surface sites after the Proteus Wave fired, have made their way to Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah. A leading theory is that they share esoteric properties with several of the Thargoids' recent technological advances, and may hold the key to developing countermeasures. Many other scientists are focusing on xenological research, striving to locate a weakness or develop an advantage. »

« Until such a breakthrough occurs, we are reliant upon our spacefaring warriors to contain the most destructive adversary the human race has ever faced. This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* The Pro-Aegis Stance of the Princess
Princess Aisling Duval's call for the Empire to commit to a resumed Aegis project, alongside the Alliance and Federation, has received a harsh response.

Admiral Denton Patreus was approached for comment by the Eye on Achenar newsfeed:

« We all have our part to play in the Empire, but questioning military policy is hardly within a princess's remit. I would humbly suggest that Her Highness focuses on those areas where she excels: charity work, hosting parties, advocating the wellbeing of the citizens and so forth. »

A similar viewpoint was expressed by Senator Zemina Torval, who simply remarked: « Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but there was a time when attempting to challenge the Emperor's decree was viewed as an insult to the throne. »

Hadrian Augustus Duval's response was less confrontational but clear: « I firmly believe that non-collaboration is the best direction for the Empire, and respectfully ask Aisling not to undermine this policy through the press. »

However, Senator Caspian Leopold offered an alternative take:

« Princess Aisling has a much better understanding of political realities than many give her credit for. After personally consulting with scientific, military and political specialists, she has concluded that reforming Aegis is the logical move. Far from challenging Emperor Arissa's policy, this is a heartfelt attempt to support her reign by increasing the Empire's chances of victory against the Thargoids. »


* Experimental Weapons Stabiliser Becomes Available
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The class 3 experimental weapon stabiliser is now available following Azimuth Biotech's delivery initiative in LHS 1163.

The corporation's PR division confirmed the release of its new product in a press release:

« This variant of Azimuth's experimental weapons stabiliser is now widely available for purchase. By redirecting and absorbing internal stresses, it allows a ship to carry a total of five AX weapons rather than the previous limit of four. The class 5 variant of the stabiliser, which permits two additional AX weapons, is scheduled to reach the market next week. »

« Our manufacturing partners were able to begin this rapid production cycle thanks to receiving great quantities of meta-alloys, insulating membranes, HN shock mounts and beryllium. Pilots who delivered these materials can now collect their rewards from the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 1163 system. »

« Azimuth Biotech remains fully committed to supporting anti-xeno initiatives. Our team will continue playing a significant role in combating Thargoid aggression and protecting innocent lives. »

Retail outlets have reported an increase in purchases for both AX missile racks and multi-cannons, including the enhanced designs recently produced by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo. The class 5 variant of the experimental weapons stabiliser is expected to further boost sales of AX weaponry when released on Thursday 2nd February.


* Xeno Scanner Upgrade
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

An improved xeno scanner has been released to assist combat vessels engaged in anti-xeno operations.

Following increased calls from AX pilots that the existing xeno scanner's limited range was a hindrance, Professor Palin's team at Arque Laboratory delivered a redesign to manufacturers that extends the scanner's upper range to two kilometres.

Industrial complexes have worked overtime to distribute the latest model of xeno scanner. It is now available from military, high-tech and industrial planetary bases, as well as rescue megaships.


* Delaine Vows to Defend California Nebula
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has rallied in the California Nebula to repel the region's Thargoid invasion forces.

In recent weeks Thargoid fleets swarmed through several local systems. The Kumo Council, the enclave's authority for the notorious organisation, rapidly called in reinforcements in three systems it governs. Local security forces are now organising counter-attacks against Thargoid vessels.

Archon Delaine, warlord of the Kumo Crew, announced:

« Already the war has reached the California Nebula. But are any superpower navies racing to its defence? Of course not \u2013 the Alliance considers this colony expendable. It's down to us to protect the nebula's citizens, and will do whatever it takes to succeed. »

The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed published a request for populations not to impede Kumo Crew activity, suggesting that fleet mobilisation is 'a temporary measure to provide a coordinated resistance against the Thargoids'. It is thought Kumo Crew's megaship, the Mictlan, is preparing to deploy in support of these efforts.

This message was rejected by Turner Research Group, which controls several of the invaded systems. The scientific organisation was established by the Alliance in 3302 to study the barnacles discovered in the region. Harrison Gladstone, the group's spokesperson, declared: « Delaine is obviously using the Thargoid attacks as a pretence for a power grab. There is no chance that these pirates will defend our systems out of the goodness of their blackened hearts. We'll know what Delaine's real plan is soon enough. »

The California Nebula has witnessed several Thargoid attacks, most recently last October, but this is the first marked increase in hostilities following the arrival of the Maelstroms.


* Admiral Tanner Withdraws from Federal Navy
Admiral Aden Tanner has formally resigned his commission with the Federal Navy, mere weeks after a presidential pardon overturned his court martial.

He had returned to naval service following an executive order from President Zachary Hudson. But this unexpected resignation means he is no longer a member of the military, although he retains the honorific of 'admiral'.

Admiral Tanner released a personal statement, which was published by The Federal Times:

« I must begin by expressing my gratitude to President Hudson, and thank all those who supported my actions in the T Tauri system. History has proven that Salvation was willing to sacrifice millions of lives in his personal vendetta against the Thargoids, and we are suffering the after-effects of that obsession today. »

« The Federal Navy was once my home, but my disillusionment has grown over recent years. Politics and commercial influences hold this great institution back from safeguarding the Federation to its fullest capability. Now that the Thargoid threat has reached such a colossal degree, I find such restrictions frustrating to a point that I would likely be a nuisance to my fellow admirals. I have too much respect for every person serving the navy to offer anything less than my best \u2013 that best is now prohibited by bureaucracy. Therefore I am stepping down for the benefit of all. »

« As per the presidential pardon's terms, I will continue developing anti-xeno strategies as an independent military specialist. I will liaise directly with Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori to contribute to the navy's war efforts, while also collaborating with other organisations down the line. I remain dedicated to saving lives and bringing this war to an end as soon as possible. »

« To any Thargoids who may be listening: you haven't seen the last of me yet. »


* Emperor Approves Aisling's Plan for Aegis
Princess Aisling Duval met with Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval in person to discuss an Imperial contribution to the reformation of Aegis.

The Imperial Herald's political journalist Cassia Carvalho reported on events:

« Aisling Duval's arrival at the Imperial Palace was completely unexpected, according to several dignitaries whose appointed meetings with the Emperor were abruptly cancelled. One senatorial aide described how the princess 'burst into the throne room so suddenly that I'm surprised the Imperial Guard didn't shoot her'. »

« Despite visible irritation, Emperor Arissa acceded to Princess Aisling's demand for urgent talks. The two royals held a private conversation behind closed doors for many hours. I heard claims of raised voices at one stage, but nobody was willing to go on record to confirm this. »

« Eventually, Her Majesty call for the media to assemble, which we did eagerly. The Emperor made it clear that her decree to isolate from the other superpowers remained active. However, if Aegis were to be re-established, a limited number of scientists and naval vessels would be allocated to the anti-xeno agency. Princess Aisling would take ownership of the endeavour, and coordinate with both Imperial and foreign organisations. »

« Senators and Imperial Navy officials were surprised by this exception to the Emperor's policy. But political analysts remarked on the shrewdness of making Princess Aisling personally responsible for the proposed anti-xeno collaboration, thereby distancing the Emperor from any potential failures. »

« Insiders claim that Princess Aisling has already requested members for her delegation including Senator Caspian Leopold, Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson  and xenological specialist Ivano Colombera. She has also tasked the Imperial Diplomatic Corps with re-opening diplomatic channels to the Alliance and Federation, specifically to share information about Alba Tesreau's respective proposals for a reformed Aegis. »


* Class 5 Experimental Weapons Stabiliser Released
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has commercially launched a new module that allows two additional AX weapons to be added to large ships.

The experimental weapons stabiliser increases the number of AX weapons which can be installed on a ship. The class 3 variant released last week increases the limit to five, whereas the class 5 variant released yesterday increases it to six.

Both versions entered mass production following Azimuth Biotech's highly successful resource drive in the LHS 1163 system. CEO Torben Rademaker issued a statement to accompany the product launch:

« Our proprietary technology has bypassed the inherent design flaws of Aegis's AX weaponry. The experimental weapons stabiliser will play a vital role in the ongoing defence of the core systems. »

« I can only assume that the current chatter about reforming Aegis is due to misplaced nostalgia. How quickly people forget the Baumann Report, which laid bare the organisation's inefficiency and incompetence. The logical path to victory is to employ the most accomplished anti-xeno specialists, such as those found here at Azimuth Biotech. »


* Pirates Lead Counter-Attack Against Thargoids
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Kumo Crew is marshalling the defence of the California Nebula by offering rewards for eliminating Thargoid vessels.

The Kumo Council, the syndicate's ruling body, assumed control of several systems that were recently invaded by Thargoid fleets. Independent pilots have been asked to take part in anti-xeno initiatives within the region, which are being coordinated from The Mictlan megaship.

Harrison Gladstone of the Turner Research Group, which represents the Alliance in the California Nebula, made a formal protest:

« We are not happy about defence initiatives being funded by a ruthless criminal gang. These pirates are using the Thargoid attacks to expand their illegal activity, thus jeopardising our faction's scientific and commercial interests. Several of our ports in the area are now under Kumo Crew 'emergency protections', as they've termed it. This is an illegal occupation of Allied territory! »

In response, Archon Delaine claimed:

« Taking charge of local security forces is necessary to form an effective anti-xeno militia. If the Alliance cares so much about this region, where are their warships? We're doing Mahon's job for him. The colonists here will soon understand our decision is the correct one. »

The Kumo Council has agreed to reimburse all Thargoid combat bonds handed in at The Mictlan in California Sector HR-W d1-28.


* Mahon: 'Alliance Will Support Aegis'
The Alliance Assembly has voted to make a contribution to Aegis if the agency is reformed by the three superpowers.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made an official announcement:

« Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's change of heart regarding anti-xeno collaboration has triggered swift action from Alliance systems. The Assembly has re-appraised a bill proposed last November by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, seeking to approve Aegis's reformation. A majority vote has now passed that bill. »

« The Alliance will therefore commit ships, resources and personnel to a collaborative anti-xeno agency. We will also share Thargoid-related intelligence and scientific data to a central database shared with the Empire and Federation. »

« The strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation remains in effect, and the company continues to work with us on protecting Allied systems. »

It has been suggested that Li Yong-Rui privately advised the prime minister against holding the vote, with the view that Sirius Corporation could fill the role of humanity's primary anti-xeno organisation. However, political analysts noted that Mahon has a long-standing dedication to multilateral cooperation against the Thargoids.

Deputy Prime Minister Corcoran will act as the Alliance's primary contact with any new incarnation of Aegis. Commodore Emil Varga  has volunteered to serve as military liaison, with Dr Maximo Fonseca  of Gateway Laboratories taking the lead on xenological research.


* Activists Blame Leaders for Thargoid War
Anti-authoritarian protests have surged in the Alliance, Empire and Federation with governments accused of responsibility for Thargoid hostility.

Vox Galactica's political correspondent Conrad Sterling published a special report:

« The xeno-peace movement, which originally advocated diplomatic relations with the Thargoids, lost a lot of momentum following the arrival of the Maelstroms. But some former members are blaming Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders for allowing the war to escalate, with profits from corporate arms deals seen as the motive. »

« Timothy Culver, once a spokesperson for the Thargoid Advocacy Project, believes that conflict was always the superpowers' policy. 'They knew the Proteus Wave would trigger an aggressive reaction from the Thargoids,' he claims \u2013 without providing evidence, it should be noted. 'Shareholders in the military/industrial complex always make a fortune during wartime. The blood of billions is on their money-grabbing hands.' »

« An uncoordinated wave of activism across the core systems has included civil lawsuits, protest marches and occasional clashes with security personnel. There have even been attempted break-ins at administrative complexes and politicians' homes, where some activists believe proof of conspiracy can be found. »

« Xeno-peace figureheads, such as ICE-caster Joy Senne, have distanced themselves from these incidents and the general TAP movement in recent weeks. Congressman Dalton Chase has made no further statements on the Kingfisher tragedy, his spokesperson citing a 'focus on other projects'. Only Heimar Borichev of the Sovereign continues to broach the subject, claiming recently: 'Institutional corruption requires radical solutions.' »

« Allied Interpol and the Imperial Internal Security Service claim that the public disorder is under control, while the Proactive Detection Bureau has begun identifying and 'pre-cautioning' Federal citizens who express anti-authority sympathies. But as the death toll from the Thargoid war continues to rise, the demands for responsibility seem unlikely to fade. »


* Kumo Crew Rebuffed after Anti-Xeno Campaign
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A successful initiative to hold the California Nebula against Thargoid invasion has succeeded, for now at least.

Systems recently invaded by Thargoid fleets were protected by a militia organised by the Kumo Council, the criminal syndicate's ruling authority in the enclave. But an attempt to assume control of the region's ports has been surprisingly repelled by opponents of Delaine.

The Pegasi Sentinel reported on the situation:

« There can be no doubt that Archon Delaine takes the security of the California Nebula seriously. Many lives were saved thanks to his decisive actions. A Kumo Crew anti-xeno militia is already being considered for future Thargoid attacks. »

« Local residents remain wary of Delaine's reputation, however. Security forces deployed to local ports have been driven out, with communities apparently unconvinced by claims of 'emergency security measures'. Turner Research Group has re-established control in locations the Kumo Council had attempted to seize. »

A related article was also published by The Alliance Tribune:

« The Assembly received an urgent request for support from the Turner Research Group. They claim that the Kumo Crew's campaign was an excuse to encroach upon the Alliance's operations in the California Nebula. Councillors have raised a motion to begin a formal inquiry into the situation. »

The Mictlan megaship, currently in California Sector HR-W d1-28, is reimbursing Thargoid combat bonds for all pilots who contributed to the initiatives.


* Federation Pledges Resources to Aegis
President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters have united behind Federal backing for the reformation of Aegis.

Congress held an emergency debate after the Alliance and Empire agreed to support an official tri-superpower initiative against the Thargoids. A majority of votes from Republican, Liberal and independent representatives approved the provision of ships, personnel and materials from the Federation.

President Hudson delivered a short address to mark the occasion:

« The intensified Thargoid attacks against the core systems demand a proportionate response. We recognise that Salvation was directly responsible for many of the tragic events that Aegis was blamed for. The Federation has an opportunity to correct that misjudgement and do our part to defeat a common adversary. »

Congressman Tom Gillespie has volunteered to coordinate the Federation's involvement with any unified anti-xeno activities. Professor Shamus Madigan of Olympus Village University will continue to lead on xenological research. The Federal Navy has assigned Rear Admiral Daniel Parry to act as its military liaison, a reduced version of the role formerly occupied by Admiral Aden Tanner.

Professor Alba Tesreau has publicly thanked the leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation for their « renewed faith in the ideals that Aegis represents ».


* Aegis Returns
The anti-xeno agency Aegis has been officially reformed by the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

Aegis was initially founded in 3303 to centralise research into the Thargoids, as well as coordinate defence and rescue operations. It was disbanded in 3308 following accusations of incompetence in the wake of the Alexandria disaster and the subsequent findings of the Baumann Report. The recent escalation of the Thargoid War and calls for renewed collaboration between the superpowers have led to a reversal of that decision.

Professor Alba Tesreau will serve as the head of the revived organisation. She provided details at a press conference:

« Aegis remains humanity's best hope of ending this calamitous war with the Thargoids. Its priority is to better understand the alien species through scientific research, and to utilise those findings to improve our defensive and weapon capabilities. »

« Each superpower has appointed an individual to oversee its contributions: Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran for the Alliance, Princess Aisling Duval for the Empire, and Congressman Tom Gillespie for the Federation. We have also invited many independent specialists to partner with Aegis, including Professor Ishmael Palin, Ram Tah and a previous key member of Aegis, Aden Tanner. »

« Criticism from the Baumann Report has been taken on board. Our new organisational structure follows the streamlined approach used by the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism Unit to great success. To improve coordination, a limited application of Omega Grid networking will facilitate rapid and secure communications between key members. »

« Aegis's first research project is already underway. The engineer Petra Olmanova has approached us with preliminary designs for a method of allowing ships to survive longer within the Maelstroms' corrosive clouds. We have assigned several metallurgy and chemistry experts to develop this further. »


* Thargoids Devastate Witch Head Enclave
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Populated systems in the Witch Head Nebula have been overrun by Thargoid fleets, resulting in widespread chaos.

Thargoid vessels have directly targeted starports and planetary bases, leaving tens of thousands of casualties. With the nebula located hundreds of light years from the core systems, rescue services are struggling to aid the fleeing survivors.

Vox Galactica published a fragmented message transmitted by the engineer Chloe Sedesi:

« \u2026emergency SOS from the Shenve system. The Thargoids\u2026 full-scale invasion. They've hit us hard. The\u2026 evacuated my team and abandoned Cinder Dock. We're trying to get clear from\u2026 swarms of them, in every direction we turn. If anyone's receiving this, we're\u2026 »

Captain Warren Lamar, head of security for the Alliance Expeditionary Pact, made this statement:

« In recent years we've fought off several Thargoid strikes, but the sheer scale of these attacks is unprecedented. The Golden Stag megaship in Onoros has been destroyed, with most of our forces scattered. I've urgently requested reinforcements from the Alliance, but we are desperate for immediate support. »

The Witch Head Enclave was established in 3305 following the discovery of barnacle sites, which were commercially exploited by the Alliance as sources of meta-alloys. Dr Maximo Fonseca and other leading xenologists believe that securing barnacle-rich systems is part of the Thargoids' expansion strategy.


* Princess Aisling 'Understood Risk of Speaking Out'
Princess Aisling Duval has assumed oversight of the Empire's contributions to the tri-superpower agency Aegis.

She discussed her new role during an interview with The Imperial Herald:

« Loathe though I was to defy the Emperor's decree, every instinct told me that the Aegis initiative can develop methods of protecting the Empire from enormous losses in this war. I'm grateful that Arissa recognised the value of my plea. »

« I've been liaising with Professor Alba Tesreau, as well as Dr Fonseca, Vice Admiral Anderson and the rest of my team. Our challenge is to make the most of the Imperial resources allocated to Aegis. »

« It's true that I was critical of Aegis's effectiveness in the past, but I've always believed that cooperation with other superpowers can bring mutual benefits. The mass slaughter inflicted by the Thargoids eclipses the NMLA's atrocities \u2013 a challenge we faced together. We must trust each other now as we did then. »

The newsfeed also featured a response from Hadrian Augustus Duval:

« It's gratifying to see that Patreus and Torval aren't as influential as they think they are. Yet that doesn't mean Aisling is right. The Empire must not chain itself to the Alliance and Federation once again. The Emperor can be ruthless when it suits her, as I know only too well, but in this case she lacks the courage of her convictions. »

Royal correspondent Gudrun Vestergaard observed:

« This is a calculated move by Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. If Aegis fails, her isolationist policy will be vindicated. If Aegis succeeds, she can claim credit for permitting this exception. The risk is whether the public would credit an Aegis-assisted victory over the Thargoids to the Princess. Such an outcome would increase Aisling's popularity and political capital to a level Arissa is unlikely to tolerate for long. »


* Maelstrom Protection Technology Undergoes Testing
Aegis has produced a prototype module that increases a ship's ability to survive within caustic environments.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of the newly reformed agency, published this statement:

« The blueprints provided by Petra Olmanova have been rapidly developed by Aegis's newly acquired chemical engineers, metallurgists and ship technicians. Utilising their combined skills, they have constructed a working prototype. »

« This new module functions along similar lines to a heatsink launcher. It is designed to channel the corrosive reaction experienced within a Thargoid Maelstrom to specific replaceable anodes prior to ejection, thereby extending a ship's range and operating time. We hope this will allow more data to be acquired about these mysterious objects. »

« Aden Tanner has volunteered to personally pilot the ship in the live tests taking place this week. Time is of the essence, since the humanitarian cost of the Thargoid invasions rises every day. »

Rear Admiral Daniel Parry, the Federal Navy's military liaison to Aegis, commented:

« I've served under Admiral Tanner, and his involvement with these test flights doesn't surprise me one bit. He takes pride is never sending personnel on assignments he wouldn't undertake personally. But he's also sending a message: Aegis will no longer rely so heavily on independent pilots risking their lives. While Commanders of the Pilots' Federation are still our most adaptable and reliable field agents, Aegis will seek to work alongside them wherever possible. »


* Aegis Launches Caustic Sink Launcher Initiative
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries are requested in Duamta to fast-track production of a module that protects ships in caustic environments.

Professor Alba Tesreau, the head of Aegis, provided these details:

« We are grateful to Aden Tanner for personally testing our prototype caustic sink launcher. The electrochemical reaction within the Maelstrom cloud was successfully channelled into semi-liquid anodes for ejection. This kept the ship hull intact for considerably longer before Tanner was forced to withdraw. »

« Aegis is setting up manufacturing and distribution centres to make the caustic sink launcher widely available. The Alliance, Empire and Federation will all contribute, but we know that the process can be accelerated with the direct support of the galactic community. »

« Therefore, we have an open order for shipments of advanced catalysers, heatsink interlinks and palladium. We also require caustic tissue samples obtained from the caustic generators that can be found inside the Maelstrom clouds. I urge pilots to exercise caution as these are highly dangerous to obtain, but crucial to the modules' manufacturing process. »

Pilots can deliver these resources to the Orunmilla in the Duamta system. Aegis confirmed that the first commercially produced caustic sink launchers will be awarded to the initiative's top contributors.

Xenological research groups have reacted positively to this development. Director Ivano Colombera of the Imperial Science Academy stated:

« Aegis has immediately justified its reformation with this contribution to the war effort. The caustic sink launcher will allow more data on the Maelstroms to be gathered, thus furthering our understanding of the Thargoids' capabilities. »


* Thargoid War Update: February 3309
An overview of recent developments regarding the Thargoid conflict, as reported by Jade Sanderlyn on the Vox Galactica newsfeed.

« Over the last month, Thargoid fleets have continued expanding outwards from the eight Maelstroms. The front lines of the war are relentlessly encroaching deeper into the core systems, leaving desolation and death in their wake. »

« A dedicated resistance force won a few precious victories, with 61 systems fully liberated from Thargoid control. But compared to the 634 systems that have been overrun, it would be optimistic to suggest the aliens' advance is being significantly impeded at this stage. »

« Fierce fighting has also broken out in the California and Witch Head Nebulas. It's been speculated that the Thargoids seek to secure the barnacle sites seeded in those regions millennia ago\u2026 a reminder that this species may view all of our space as its original territory. »

« Despite these grim developments, practical support arrived in the form of Azimuth Biotech's experimental weapons stabilisers and Professor Palin's improved xeno scanner. Both were welcomed by independent pilots, increasing their chances of triumphing over the powerful Thargoid vessels. »

« Of course, the biggest news is the resurrection of Aegis. Key figures in the Alliance, Empire and Federation managed to re-establish the anti-xeno agency that was once abandoned in favour of Salvation. Already there are promises of technological breakthroughs, including the ability for ships to better withstand the caustic hell inside the Maelstroms. »

« As our best and brightest work together in earnest, time will tell if they can prevent this war from overwhelming us all. This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Rackham Reveals Presidential Manifesto
Trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham has launched his campaign to be elected as Federal president in the forthcoming election.

He outlined several policies during a press event in the tropospheric suite of Rackham's Spire on the planet Homeland:

« As I see it, the job of president is to help ordinary, hard-working people from humble backgrounds \u2013 just like me. So I pledge to reduce all civil taxes and public service fees, and boost government funding for business grants and commercial opportunities. Let's make everyone rich and successful \u2013 just like me! »

Mr Rackham is running for the position of Federal president as an independent candidate and claims support from several corporate interests including Rackham Capital Investments. His manifesto has triggered a surge in popularity, with several high-profile celebrities promoting his campaign slogan: 'Just Like Me'.

However, economists have noted that his tax-cutting proposals remain uncosted and are considered virtually unachievable. The journalist Bryanna Blanco, who has been investigating Mr Rackham's business affairs for years, described his presidential promises as « populist nonsense from a former pirate turned politician ».

The presidential election will be held in June 3309. Shadow President Felicia Winters has confirmed that she will represent the Liberal Party, with Congressman Isolde Rochester as her running mate.

The Republican Party candidate will be announced after Congress's vote on the Hudson Contravention, which is scheduled for mid-March. If this constitutional amendment is approved, it will permit President Zachary Hudson to stand for a second eight-year term. Other senior Republican congressmen, including Vice President Jerome Archer, are also preparing their electoral campaigns.


* Explorers Needed for Ammonia World Survey
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Universal Cartographics has announced a two-week initiative to locate planets with ammonia atmospheres.

The survey was outlined by Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics:

« Aegis has urgently requested an update to our database of terrestrial planets with ammonia atmospheres. It is no coincidence that each Maelstrom is located in a system containing such worlds, given that Thargoid biochemistry is ammonia-based. »

« We are therefore liaising with Aegis to chart as many ammonia worlds as possible. As well as contributing to xenological research, our intent is to identify potential staging grounds for Thargoid fleets and arrival points for additional Maelstroms. »

« Over the next two weeks, pilots can obtain increased payouts for delivering cartographic survey data to Angus Manwaring starport in the Eta Cassiopeiae system. Only ammonia world data will be recognised for the purpose of the survey campaign, however, with detailed surface scans particularly appreciated. »

As an incentive for participation, general cartographic data payouts will be multiplied for a further period if the initiative is successful. The multiplier will depend on the campaign tier achieved.

The most recent survey of this kind took place in 3306, when Sirius Atmospherics claimed to be developing a method of terraforming ammonia worlds for human habitation. Dr Maximilian North has since stated that the project is on hold following « practical obstacles impacting our ecosphere conversion theories ».


* Caustic Sink Launcher Aids Maelstrom Exploration
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis's initiative in the Duamta system has kick-started production of a ship module designed for caustic environments.

Shipments of advanced catalysers, heatsink interlinks and palladium were delivered following a request from Professor Alba Tesreau. Pilots also provided tissue samples extracted from the caustic generators inside each Maelstrom, which are a vital component of these modules.  Manufacturing bases have now been established, allowing stocks of the caustic sink launcher to reach the public market.

Dr Maximo Fonseca, head of xenological research at Gateway Laboratories, published a statement on behalf of Aegis:

« The Thargoids have developed powerful defences to prevent their enemies reaching the heart of the Maelstroms. The dangerously caustic gas clouds are an effective deterrent, and have sadly claimed the lives of many intrepid pilots. »

« So, the caustic sink launcher is an exciting breakthrough that will both save lives and facilitate vital data recovery. Now that ships can survive for longer within the clouds, the acquisition and study of tissue samples and caustic shards should increase. The next priority for Aegis is to study the massive energy surges that prevent access to the inner region of a Maelstrom. »

Aegis has invited all pilots who took part in the delivery initiative to collect their rewards from the Orunmilla in the Duamta system.


* Marlinists Facing 'Increasingly Grave' Future
The Marlinist Colonies are struggling to survive the harsh realities of independence while preparing for the impact of the Thargoid war.

An editorial in The Marlin Standard summarised their situation:

« In recent months, our noble goal of building a Marlinist Republic has been harshly curtailed. Many of the original eight colony systems, among them the capital Concordia, are now dominated by outsiders including Federal and Sirius-aligned corporations. We have survived persecution, civil war and terrorism, only to find our people exploited by the opportunism of neighbouring factions. »

In the Empire, the prevalent viewpoint is that the Marlinists are suffering the consequences of their own actions. As Senator Arturo Durant remarked: « They voted to reject the Emperor's offer to become an Imperial protectorate, so now they must pay the price. »

Compounding this is the increasing danger posed by the Thargoids as their fleets penetrate deeper into the core systems. The Citizens' Chronicle newsfeed has published concerned messages from some Imperial citizens for their Marlinist cousins. One viral commenter proclaimed: « The colonists aren't enemies! They were once our loved ones, our friends and family, driven away for their political beliefs. How can we turn our backs on them? »

The Marlinist Parliament has signalled a willingness to contribute to Aegis, but its priority is to establish control over its chartered systems. First Minister Octavia Volkov has admitted: « Without a dedicated military to achieve this, our future prospects look increasingly grave. »

The Marlinists' situation is mirrored elsewhere, as noted by war reporter Ernesto Rios for Vox Galactica:

« Vulnerability to Thargoid attack is a universal concern among independent systems. Many non-superpower factions are banding together in small clusters to cooperate on anti-xeno operations and share resources. A spirit of camaraderie has arisen in the face of annihilation. But will that be enough against the overwhelming might of the Thargoids? »


* Alliance Sends Warning to Kumo Crew
Recent activities by the Kumo Crew syndicate in the California Nebula have been formally condemned by the Alliance.

Councillor Jed Trager  supervised an investigation into the Kumo Council's attempt to take control of several systems, ostensibly to defend them against a wave of Thargoid attacks. He summarised its findings during a session of the Assembly:

« Intelligence provided by Alliance Interpol agents proves that the underlying objective of the Kumo Crew's anti-xeno militia was to dominate the California Nebula. The syndicate had gathered ships and infiltrated civil institutions weeks earlier, using bribery and coercion to pave the way for their takeover. »

« Further Thargoid attacks in the region were seen as inevitable, based on past behaviour and the prevalence of barnacle sites. When they occurred the Kumo Crew mobilised their pre-prepared forces, overthrowing local authorities under the pretence of 'emergency security measures'. »

« Our investigation has concluded that this was a brazen act of aggression against Allied factions. The Kumo Crew illegally attempted to hijack the Alliance's assets and impose direct rule over our colonies. »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon delivered a public statement:

« The Kumo Council's opportunistic attempt to profit from the horrors of a Thargoid invasion is a truly despicable act. But it has not gone unnoticed that they have suffered setbacks in Haithis, Kolabinates and Saontiana since this misguided effort to disrupt Allied operations. I am grateful to the communities within the California Nebula, and to those independents who aided them, for resisting these criminals. »

« My message to Archon Delaine is this: The Alliance is watching you. »


* Archon Delaine Counters Mahon's Rebuke
Archon Delaine has rejected Prime Minister Mahon's warning over an alleged attempt to gain control of systems in the California Nebula.

« Wake up, Old Man Mahon! » Delaine said in a public broadcast. « The Kumo Crew migrated into the nebula with help from some mutual friends of ours\u2026 people you now consider allies. You like to portray us as criminals lusting for power and influence, but the real crooks are much closer to home. Rather than watching us, you should try looking over your shoulder. »

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse published his observations via the Rewired network:

« Watching two of Sirius Corporation's business partners openly fight like this must be making Li Yong Rui cringe as much as his poker face allows. What's that? You never heard of the most powerful megacorp in history dealing with pirates? Surely not! »

« Delaine is clearly referring to 3307, when he somehow convinced Kavanagh Spaceframes to build him five Orbis stations. One of these, California Freeport in HIP 18390, planted the Kumo flag in the nebula and served as the base for the gang's recent attempt to seize Allied assets there. »

« It was never revealed how the syndicate funded the construction of the starports. Or why Sirius Corporation subsidiaries appeared in those systems around the same time. But you don't have to hire the Wallglass Agency to find a connection there. »

« Oh and by the way, Kavanagh Spaceframes was renamed Rackham Spaceframes following its purchase by Rackham Capital Investments last year. What's that? The trillionaire and the pirates working together as well? Surely not! »


* Federal Eyes on Congress Debate
Preliminary motions on the forthcoming Hudson Contravention vote have begun in Federal Congress.

The proposal, named after President Zachary Hudson's call to suspend the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord, is a point of significant contention. If approved, Hudson would be eligible to run for another term in this year's presidential elections, breaking with centuries of constitutional law.

Supporters of the proposal, led by Hudson's cabinet, point to the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids as a primary reason to vote in favour. With the significant escalation in Thargoid aggression and the loss of hundreds of systems, it has been argued that a change of leadership could weaken the Federation's ability to defend itself.

Opponents have called the move a 'dictatorial' tactic which uses the fear of alien attack to influence public opinion. Felicia Winters, the Liberal candidate and current shadow president, recently discussed this further during an interview with the Federal Free Press:

« In these difficult times we cannot forget who we are, or what makes the Federation great. The 77th amendment was established in 2594, and has defined the presidential length of service ever since. This structure not only provides clarity to the people who use their vote to inform Federal governance, but also to each individual entrusted with the honour of the presidency. To change it now would send a message that we have lost faith in the Federation's political mechanism. »

The official vote on the Hudson Contravention motion is expected to take place next week.


* Aegis Recommends Preventative Anti-Xeno Tactic
*Pilots Federation Alert*

An analysis of the ongoing Thargoid war has been released by Aegis and made available to all superpower and independent navies.

The focus of the report centres on protecting systems at threat of Thargoid invasion. It suggests that anti-xeno forces are primarily fighting Thargoid invasion fleets which have already arrived, understandable due to the immediate risk to civilian life. However, Aegis proposes that increasing defensive efforts for systems at threat of invasion would be a more efficient way of slowing the spread of Thargoid-controlled territory.

Commodore Emil Varga provided a statement alongside the report's release:

« The effort required to repel an invasion fleet is far higher than dissuading that fleet from entering a system in the first place. »

« We believe that Thargoids have assumed a 'path of least resistance' approach to expansion. Thanks to the efforts of our skilled pilots, we have sufficient evidence to show that Thargoids will not deploy a full strength force in locations where advance Thargoid vessels encounter heavy resistance. »

« The Orthrus vessels, in particular, appear key to prepping systems for invasion. The exact mechanisms in which they do so are yet to be verified, but an Orthrus appears to provide key logistical details about an expansion target. It is clear that invading Thargoid vessels know exactly where to emerge from hyperspace to attack local ports and tactical assets. Destroying Orthrus ships may be key to safeguarding an alerted system. »

As an incentive to draw combat pilots to systems on alert, combat bonds payouts on Orthrus vessels have been increased.


* Ammonia World Survey Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis and Universal Cartographics have announced that the project to survey ammonia worlds has ended satisfactorily.

Special mention goes to Commander aRadish, Commander Lone WolfPack and Commander T'Verez for their efforts.

The exploration initiative was praised by Congressman Tom Gillespie, who oversees Federal contributions to Aegis:

« An impressive number of terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres were scanned and catalogued over the last two weeks. Universal Cartographics certainly considers the project to be a great success, and I know our xenological scientists do too. »

« This is the kind of task for which independent Commanders are absolutely unmatched in dedication and expertise, and they remain our indispensable allies. »

Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson, the Imperial military liaison to Aegis, added:

« This information is of considerable strategic value. Each system containing an ammonia world will be monitored using concealed sensor buoys. This will alert Aegis to the presence of Thargoid vessels or Maelstrom manifestations. Advance warnings will provide increased time to evacuate systems or mount pre-emptive strikes. »

Pilots can receive payment for their exploration data at Angus Manwaring starport in the Eta Cassiopeiae system.  The promised x3 multiplier on exploration data profits for the next two weeks has also commenced, with Universal Cartographics providing this through its starport contacts.


* Rumours Circulate Around Seo Jin-ae
An anonymous source has leaked information regarding Seo Jin-ae suggesting that she may be in serious jeopardy.

Seo Jin-ae, the individual once known as Subject D-2, voluntarily departed from a private medical facility in January, where she was under the care of former Aegis members. She left a message stating: « I have unfinished business with Salvation. »

The engineer Kit Fowler discussed the recent rumours during his End Times broadcast:

« Something is definitely going on, people. The interstellar grapevine is buzzing with gossip about Seo Jin-ae. That cortical implant in her head, which provides some weird insight into Thargoid behaviour, makes her pretty much most valuable person in the galaxy right now. »

« Some say that a black ops teams have either kidnapped or assassinated her. Maybe it's Azimuth. Maybe it's a dead man's switch group belonging to Salvation. One pilot tells me he spotted an Aegis patrol in the Ngaruayanka system, and thinks it was sent to recover poor Seo's body. And a hacktivist from the Collective has intercepted comms fragments containing the words 'Bright Sentinel' and 'Nemesis protocol'. What secrets did Seo uncover? And is she still alive to share them? »

Aegis has been approached for comment, but only reiterated that they are currently investigating Seo Jin-ae's whereabouts.

Director Nassim Qadir, head of medical research at Azimuth Biotech, provided a statement:

« Aegis's amateurish efforts to examine Ms Seo have clearly resulted in some form of dissociative disorder and paranoid delusions. This explains her obsessive vendetta against a man whose death was independently verified. If Ms Seo can be located, she should be returned to Azimuth's specialist laboratories for her own wellbeing. »


* Congress Votes Against Hudson Contravention
President Zachary Hudson's motion to allow him to serve a second term of office has been defeated by congressional vote.

The proposal would have temporarily repealed the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, which sets a maximum presidential term of eight years. A narrow majority voted not to accept this change to the Federation's constitution.

President Hudson addressed Congress following the announcement of the result:

« The Federation's democratic principles are paramount, and so I accept the decision of this chamber. I only hope that the disruption caused by a shift in leadership does not weaken our ability to withstand the current challenges. It is with total conviction that I say the Republican party will achieve victory in the ongoing war and maintain security within our borders. I intend to support the next Republican candidate to the best of my ability. »

This outcome confirms that President Hudson's administration will officially end shortly after the election, which is expected to take place in June but with no official date set. However, considering his many commercial and military connections, Hudson will remain a powerful political figure with a loyal supporter base.

Nominees for the Republican Party's new presidential candidate have begun lobbying for support. The frontrunners are three senior members of Hudson's cabinet: Vice President Jerome Archer, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich and Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa. Congressman Thandeka Qwabe has also been nominated despite her relative inexperience.

The Liberal Party's candidates, Shadow President Felicia Winters and her running mate Isolde Rochester, have launched their presidential campaign. Several independent candidates are challenging the two main political parties, but only the famous entrepreneur Zachary Rackham is being viewed as a serious threat.


* Far God Cultists Rescue Seo Jin-ae
Seo Jin-ae has arrived safely in the Luyten's Star system, aboard an Order of the Far God megaship.

A message was transmitted by the First Apostle of the True Chapters, a proactive sect of the pacifistic religion, from aboard the Testament:

« The one known to non-believers as Subject D-2 or Seo Jin-ae is sacred to us as the Preceptor \u2013 the first human to interpret the will of the Far God. We know her to be a holy emissary, on a personal pilgrimage that exposed her to great danger. I was able to convince my brethren to locate the Preceptor and offer her safe harbour from the heretics. »

« I beseeched the Preceptor to help us hear the Far God's divine thoughts as she does, but she informed me that the time was not yet right. She requested a reunion with her friends, who also seek ways to commune with Its heralds. While this insistence on collaborating with the unworthy is curious, we have faith that the Far God guides her path. One day the Preceptor will prepare us for the extinction of all life. It is our honour to serve her. »

Professor Alba Tesreau gave a statement to the media:

« I am very grateful to the First Apostle for her help. The Testament's timely intervention routed several unidentified hostile ships that were hunting Seo Jin-ae. Once she has completed a medical assessment, we hope to learn more about her recent findings. »

Congressman Tom Gillespie has instructed Aegis not to make formal contact with Far God cultists, whose faith is outlawed in the Federation as well as the Empire. A week's clemency has been issued in recognition of Seo's safe return, but the Testament's presence deep in Federal territory is likely to irritate President Hudson.


* Winters Announces Election Manifesto
The Liberal Party has published a detailed political manifesto in advance of the Federation's presidential election in June.

Shadow President Felicia Winters summarised her party's plans during a campaign rally on Rhea 3:

« The freedoms and privileges of Federal citizens have been abused or ignored by the Hudson administration. Our vision for governance focuses on restoring the Federation's core values, offering every individual the opportunities they deserve. »

« As your democratically elected president, I will take great pleasure in dismantling the Proactive Detection Bureau on day one. The mass-monitoring of private communications is a violation of civil rights that must end immediately. »

« For those concerned about security, especially the Thargoid threat, I assure you that there will be no reduction in military spending. In fact, our aim is to extend naval and humanitarian assistance to independent systems near our borders that face Thargoid aggression. By supporting systems around Federal space, we will establish a robust front line to repel Thargoid forces. »

The Federal Free Press praised the manifesto, remarking that it « displayed the balance of strength and compassion that has long been lacking from our leadership ». However, an editorial in Sol Today claimed: « Winters's grip on political reality has been weakened by years of ineffectual hand-wringing. »

In related news, the Republican Party is currently holding a series of caucuses to select their presidential candidate. Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa and Congressman Thandeka Qwabe have been eliminated from the running, leaving Vice President Jerome Archer and Secretary of State Lana Berkovich as the remaining nominees.


* Thargoid War Update: March 3309
Vox Galactica correspondent Jade Sanderlyn reports on the latest developments regarding the war against the Thargoids.

« In the broad sense, there have been few significant changes in Thargoid tactics. The eight Maelstroms continue to send waves of Thargoid vessels deeper into the core systems. Anti-xeno forces are certainly winning victories, and in some cases retaking previously occupied systems. But we are still losing more than we save. »

« Despite being reformed only recently, Aegis has hit the ground running. Its caustic sink launcher is now available following a successful trial by Aden Tanner. This ingenious device increases the amount of time that a ship can spend inside a Maelstrom before being impaired by corrosive damage. »

« The repulsing energy wave at the clouds' centres, however, remains impenetrable. I understand that Aegis has prioritised gathering data about this defence mechanism, and research is underway into possible countermeasures. Until more can be learned about the true nature of the Maelstroms, the chances of destroying them are virtually zero. »

« The Alliance, Empire and Federation are all working to reinforce their military strength. But the front line of this war is primarily being waged by independent pilots and squadrons. Heroic individuals such as Commander Oghmios-TTT, Commander Night Furry and Commander FrankXJR have achieved fame for their phenomenal success at destroying Thargoid vessels. »

« Such small rays of hope in the darkness remain few and far between. Many battles are being won, but the creeping fear of inevitable defeat weighs heavily on all our souls. This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Seo Jin-ae: 'I Believe Salvation Survived'
Aegis has published a personal statement from Seo Jin-ae, who claims to have evidence that Salvation planned to escape death in the HIP 22460 system.

« First of all, yes, Caleb Wycherley died when the Thargoids attacked the Bright Sentinel in HIP 22460. But, I believe, only physically. He was developing technology to automatically relocate his mind, an emergency protocol he named the Nemesis Failsafe. »

« I know how implausible that sounds, but the files I recovered from an Azimuth Biotech archive prove his intentions. For several years, Salvation ran a private project to reverse-engineer a Guardian artefact which could store consciousness. The design showed neural interactions as digital impulses, and made reference to exactly retaining his identity and memories. »

« Salvation had already extended his life to over 250 years, and was obsessed with staying alive until he could wipe out the Thargoids. I'm convinced that he has survived in some bodiless form, and that Azimuth has known all along. »

Aden Tanner, who works for Aegis as an independent specialist, also released a statement:

« I'll admit that the designs Seo found seem authentic and incredibly advanced. But the files contained no concrete proof that the Nemesis Failsafe was constructed, or if it could actually work. I'm more concerned that she was being hunted by unknown parties, who would likely have succeeded if not for the Far God cult's intervention. Perhaps it needs to be restated that actively seeking to hinder Aegis, or its valued personnel, is a crime against all three superpowers. »

In related news, the Testament megaship that rescued Seo Jin-ae from unidentified attackers has now left the Luyten's Star system, following a week of clemency offered by Federal authorities. A spokesperson for President Hudson reiterated that the Order of the Far God remains illegal in the Federation.


* Caine-Massey CEO Assassinated
Johann Fleischer, the recently appointed head of the mining corporation Caine-Massey, has been shot and killed on Mars.

Fleischer was attending a Federal Commerce Authority seminar at the Olympus Village Conference Centre. He was targeted in the audience by long-range plasma fire that proved immediately fatal. Security forces were unable to locate the shooter, but the weapon and other items were recovered.

Philippa Barlow-Lyons , the COO of Caine-Massey, told the media:

« I am saddened and sickened by this tragedy, as is everyone in the Caine-Massey family. Johann was approved as our new CEO late last year. He was a much-respected champion of enterprise, and a close personal friend. No effort must be spared in finding his murderer. »

Executive Agent Viola Trask provided a statement from the Federal Intelligence Agency:

« At present, the assassin's identity and whereabouts remain unknown. The weapon used in the attack was a professionally modified Manticore Executioner marksman rifle. Local police also found advanced ECM equipment that was used to disrupt security systems. These particular models are known to be utilised by undercover Imperial agents. However, a thorough investigation is underway and we have drawn no conclusions as yet. »


* Nemesis Failsafe: Fact or Fiction?
Azimuth Biotech has rejected Seo Jin-ae's unverified claim that Salvation survived by relocating his mind using advanced Guardian technology.

CEO Torben Rademaker issued this statement:

« I can officially confirm that Azimuth Biotech has no knowledge of any project related to a 'Nemesis Failsafe'. Frankly, suggesting that anyone could transmit their living mind across space stretches her credibility past breaking point. »

« Seo Jin-ae's absurd outbursts have justified our fears that she suffers from paranoid delusions, and has falsified data to support her personal vendetta. And she now seems to have an exalted position among the Far God cultists. Only those deranged unfortunates would take her flights of fantasy seriously. »

An article in the scientific journal The Empirical addressed the concepts featured in Seo Jin-ae's statement:

« The field of exoneurology, whereby the human mind is isolated from the neuronal network and transferred to an artificial host, is mostly comprised of failed experiments. Only the Utopia commune has ever claimed significant success. Their Sim-Archive allegedly duplicates an individual's memory engrams and uploads them to a sophisticated digital emulation program. But independent reviews of this technology have been prevented by the reclusive nature of Utopian society. »


* 'Imperial Assassin' Stokes Superpower Tensions
Federal mining corporation Caine-Massey has accused Senator Zemina Torval of assassinating its CEO Johann Fleischer.

An update from the Federal Intelligence Agency prompted a remarkable declaration from Philippa Barlow-Lyons, the company's acting CEO:

« Thanks to the FIA's assembled security footage, we now know that the man who murdered Johann Fleischer departed from Olympus Village Spaceport using a false Federal ID. He then transferred to the Tavgi system under another alias, claiming to be a prospector for Torval Mining Ltd. And so, the trail leads directly to the culprit. »

« It is very clear that Zemina Torval ordered Johann's death as an act of revenge, after he defeated her efforts in January 3308 to obtain one of Caine-Massey's most lucrative mining contracts. Analysis of the hitman's weapon and other equipment matches those typically used by Imperial Intelligence. And who is a senior officer in that ruthless spy network? Zemina's own grandson, Titus Torval. »

Senator Torval has not acknowledged or responded to the accusation. A formal statement was delivered directly to Congress by the Imperial Senate:

« We categorically reject the suggestion that any members of this august body, or of Imperial Intelligence, are connected to these events. The Empire no longer has any political or commercial involvement with the Federation, and remains focused on its extensive anti-xeno operations. »

President Zachary Hudson publicly assured Caine-Massey, which is known to be a long-standing corporate donor to the Republican Party, that further resources will be directed to the investigation. He added:

« This is a timely reminder that all citizens should be vigilant against the enemy within. If we discover that Imperial assassins and sleeper agents are responsible for this heinous crime, the Empire will be expected to act in a manner we find satisfactory. »


* Archer Launches Presidential Campaign
The Republican Party has nominated Vice President Jerome Archer as its candidate in the upcoming Federal election.

Jerome Archer was formerly the secretary of security in President Zachary Hudson's cabinet. He was promoted to vice president when his predecessor died during the Nine Martyrs attacks in 3307. He immediately proposed the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, which authorised the Proactive Detection Bureau to monitor all civilian communications in the Federation to detect future terrorist activity.

Vice President Archer began his election campaign at a political rally on Nanomam 2, where he announced:

« Throughout my career, my priority has always been the same: keeping people safe. From my days as a cop on the streets of Nueva Vista to director of the Federal Intelligence Agency, I have worked hard to increase security for all citizens. I pledge to work even harder and achieve far more as your president. »

« President Hudson's excellent legacy regarding anti-xeno operations will continue under my leadership. We will increase our defensive capabilities to protect the Federation against any kind of external or internal threat. »

The newsfeed Sol Today was supportive of the Republican Party's candidate, referring to Archer as « the only sensible choice in this era of war and moral corruption ». By contrast, an editorial in the Federal Free Press stated: « Privacy will become history if the eavesdropper-in-chief is handed the reins of power. »

Archer's running mate in the election is Congressman Niko Shirakawa , who represents the Eta Cassiopeiae system. A former major in the Federal Marine Corp, he sits on several intelligence committees and is known to have military connections.


* Corporate Battle Erupts in Tavgi System
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The killing of Caine-Massey's CEO has sparked conflict between the Federal corporation and Imperial rival Torval Mining Ltd.

Acting CEO Philippa Barlow-Lyons provided a statement regarding the hostilities:

« The Federal Intelligence Agency tracked Johann Fleischer's assassin from Mars to the Tavgi system, whereupon he boarded the Orchestral Falcon, one of Torval Mining's megaships. We demanded that he be handed over to stand trial for his crime. They refused to even acknowledge us. Zemina Torval thinks she has taken her revenge and got away with it. She is wrong. »

« Caine-Massey has instructed Tavgi Blue Life Inc, our business partner in the system, to board the Orchestral Falcon \u2013 by force, if necessary \u2013 and apprehend the suspect. We will do whatever it takes to arrest the Imperial Intelligence agent we hold responsible for murdering a captain of Federal industry. »

A response was issued by Senator Zemina Torval:

« Caine-Massey is using its CEO's death to excuse a deliberate strike against my company, damaging our share price and testing the will of our political connections. Torval Mining Ltd will defend its property, as well as the honour of the Empire, against this unjustified assault. »

To support their combat operations, Tavgi Blue Life Inc and Torval Mining Ltd have called upon Federal and Imperial naval auxiliaries to report to Gordon Enterprise and the Orchestral Falcon respectively.

The conflict has heightened political tensions between the Empire and the Federation. With the majority of superpower naval forces deployed to the Thargoid front line, system authority vessels around Tavgi have been placed on alert.

President Zachary Hudson was quick to comment that « my administration upholds the right for our factions to seek justice ». Senator Denton Patreus stated: « The Empire stands ready to shield its citizens, businesses and territories from attacks by foreign powers, xeno or otherwise. »


* Salvation-Utopia Link Raises Concerns
Similarities between the Nemesis Failsafe and Utopia's Sim-Archive have led to questions being asked about a possible connection.

Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse reported on Seo Jin-ae's recent discoveries:

« We all knew that Salvation had a messiah complex, so it's no surprise that he planned to keep his colossal ego alive after his ancient body died. We also know that Pranav Antal has been digitising his followers' brains for years. »

« My question is: did Salvation modify Antal's system for his own private use, rather than reverse-engineer Guardian technology? Or maybe Azimuth and Utopia were secretly working together all this time, and the Sim-Archive has always been Guardian-based? It would explain how Utopia is able to maintain funding for its little tech-bohemian commune. »

This theory was critiqued by The Federal Times's technology correspondent Harlow Nassry:

« It is a fact that most of Utopia's scientific development remains opaque. But the few inventions that have been examined \u2013 such as the nanomedicines acquired by Vitadyne Labs \u2013 contain no molecular markers of Guardian origin. The Sim-Archive's memory-recording techniques are based on exoneurological research conducted over hundreds of years. »

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Alliance's scientific liaison to Aegis, gave a statement to the media:

« Since successful applications in this field are so rare, we cannot ignore the potential relation between the Nemesis Failsafe designs and the Sim-Archive. I have made contact with Simguru Pranav Antal and explained the situation. He kindly invited me and my staff to visit Utopia and discuss the matter. Our findings will determine whether a formal investigation into Salvation's current status is warranted. »


* Caine-Massey Victorious in Corporate Conflict
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Fierce combat in the Tavgi system has resulted in Caine-Massey's partner Tavgi Blue Life Inc overcoming Torval Mining Ltd resistance.

The conflict was triggered by the murder of Caine-Massey's former CEO Johann Fleischer. The assassin was tracked from Mars to the Torval Mining megaship Orchestral Falcon. Circumstantial evidence suggested he was an undercover Imperial agent.

Philippa Barlow-Lyons, acting CEO of the Caine-Massey corporation, declared:

« Largely thanks to tremendous support from Federal auxiliaries, the path was cleared for us to take control of the Orchestral Falcon megaship. Only then did Torval Mining Ltd agree to hand over Johann's killer, rather than risk the loss of its precious vessel. A security team has now delivered him to Federal authorities, where I am sure we will see justice finally served. »

The Federal Intelligence Agency provided an update to the media from Executive Agent Viola Trask:

« The man in our custody has been formally arrested and charged with the homicide of Johann Fleischer. All known IDs associated with him are false. Along with the skills he displayed, this suggests that he is a professional assassin. We are working with the Proactive Detection Bureau and the Federal Navy Intelligence Office to broaden the scope of this investigation. »

Independent pilots who fought on behalf of Tavgi Blue Life Inc during the conflict can collect their rewards from Gordon Enterprise. Despite its defeat, Torval Mining Ltd has also agreed to reimburse its supporters from the Orchestral Falcon.


* Torval Mining Victorious in Corporate Conflict
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Fierce combat in the Tavgi system has resulted in Torval Mining Ltd overcoming Caine-Massey's partner Tavgi Blue Life Inc.

The conflict was triggered by the murder of Caine-Massey's former CEO Johann Fleischer. The assassin was tracked from Mars to the Torval Mining megaship Orchestral Falcon. Circumstantial evidence suggested he was an undercover Imperial agent.

Senator Zemina Torval, whose family owns the company, declared:

« Loyal defenders of the Empire have helped to bring hostilities to an end and can now collect their rewards from the Orchestral Falcon. This accusation from Caine-Massey is baseless \u2013 I am not in the habit of assassinating my business rivals. Our security teams have detained the interloper from Federal space who was using false ID as an Imperial mining prospector, and handed him over to the authorities. »

Shortly after, a statement was released by Colonel Saskia Landau, the head of Imperial Intelligence:

« My colleague Captain Titus Torval brought this issue to my attention, once he was implicated in the matter. The man who allegedly shot Mr Fleischer has been transferred to our secure facilities for questioning. We anticipate that his true identity and motivations will soon be revealed. »

The board of directors at Tavgi Blue Life Inc announced that their business partnership with Caine-Massey will be terminated, citing « displeasure at the loss of life incurred by this incident ». However, the faction will honour its pledge to reimburse independent pilots who supported Caine-Massey's operation, with rewards available at Gordon Enterprise.


* Aegis Reports on Utopia's Sim-Archive
A scientific delegation from Aegis has visited Utopia to compare its Sim-Archive with Salvation's Nemesis Failsafe designs.

A summary from Dr Maximo Fonseca was shared with newsfeeds:

« Simguru Antal agreed to meet with us as a sign of good faith, and to refute claims of collaboration with Salvation. He personally introduced us to the neurosmiths of Utopia, who can digitally encode electrochemical activity within the brain. I took part in a demonstration, uploading some of my own long-term memories into the Sim-Archive. Afterwards, my colleague Dr Cooper enjoyed a remarkably accurate simulation of my university graduation thirty years ago, who claimed she found it hard to believe the memory was not her own. »

« Analysis of the Nemesis Failsafe designs that we provided was swift, but the differences were stark. From what we understood of the summary by Utopian researchers, the Nemesis process irreversibly transforms a person's entire neuronal network into esoteric energy particles. But there was no suggestion how the particle stream might be directed or stored. »

Further scrutiny by Aegis specialists confirmed that the Nemesis Failsafe relies heavily on Guardian technology, much of which remains a mystery. Early indications suggest that Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders agree that Salvation was unlikely to have sought assistance from the Utopia commune.

Simguru Pranav Antal released a rare public statement:

« The Sim-Archive is designed to preserve human thought, not to extract it from living minds. One day, experiencing other people's stored memories will be as common as searching for information on a database. Utopia's role is to unite us all by bringing down the barriers between our individual universes. »

« Salvation's design very much relates to the preservation of one's self, rather than the storage of information for future generations. Whatever knowledge of Guardian technology he may have possessed is likely lost to us now. »


* Alliance Urges Restraint Between Superpowers
Allied and independent leaders have called upon the Empire and the Federation to discourage faction hostilities following conflict in Tavgi.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling summarised the latest developments for Vox Galactica:

« Minor skirmishes between superpower-aligned factions are not uncommon. But the Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd corporations have significant political ties, so their clash has led to bullish rhetoric from members of both Congress and the Senate. »

« Many systems where Federal and Imperial populations coexist are experiencing civil tension and spates of public disturbance. There is a sense that the historic rivalry between two militaristic superpowers is being rekindled, and that similar sparks elsewhere may fan the flames at the worst possible time. »

In the Alliance Assembly, Councillor Nakato Kaine highlighted the potential repercussions:

« Military distractions between the Empire and Federation would place more responsibility on the Alliance for protecting independent systems from Thargoid invasion. As well as a potentially horrific loss of life, that would be a significant drain on already stretched resources. The hawks in each administration should be directing their aggressive tendencies toward the Thargoids, not each other. »

In response, Prime Minister Mahon agreed to send envoys from the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations to both the Empire and the Federation. Dozens of independent systems have supported the Alliance's formal request to 'lower the temperature' and find a peaceful solution.


* Old Rivals Clash as Thargoids Advance
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Factions aligned to the Empire and Federation have declared war in Pichch, which lies in the path of Thargoid expansion.

Relations between the two superpowers have been strained in recent weeks, following the corporate skirmish in Tavgi. This has exacerbated hostilities between two long-standing rivals in the Pichch system, causing diplomatic negotiations to collapse.

The ruling council of Gauluujja Exchange claimed: « Imperial saboteurs have been undermining our operations for years, and a military solution is now the only option. » A similar statement was made by the Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum's leadership: « The typical Federal response to their problems is to blame the Empire, so we are forced to resolve this on the battlefield. »

The situation has also impacted the ongoing war against the Thargoids, as outlined in a report by freelance correspondent Karleen Troy:

« With Maelstrom Leigong's fleet expansion only a few systems away, Pichch is currently a key distribution point for anti-xeno weaponry and supplies in the region. There is widespread concern that this conflict could disrupt the flow of resources to the front line, hindering defences in multiple systems. »

Both Gauluujja Exchange and the Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum have requested help from naval auxiliaries, who can register their support for either faction at Tiptree Port.


* Aegis Trials Tech to Explore Maelstroms
Prototypes have been created of a new module designed to counteract the massive energy surge encountered by ships within Thargoid Maelstroms.

Professor Alba Tesreau made a public statement:

« Intense research into the Maelstroms by Allied, Federal and Imperial specialists has yielded practical results. We have designed a device to briefly insulate a ship against the overpowering effects of a Maelstrom's energy wave. Typically, the wave physically repels all human ships and disrupts onboard electrical systems. »

« Combined with our caustic sink launcher, the Thargoid pulse neutraliser will enable access to the innermost regions of the alien clouds. My hope is that this breakthrough will reveal knowledge about the Thargoid invasion fleets that we desperately need. »

Further details were provided by Ivano Colombera, the Empire's scientific liaison to Aegis:

« The Thargoid pulse neutraliser expands upon the shutdown field neutraliser originally designed by Elvira Martuuk in 3303. Using upgraded components, Aegis technicians have amplified its effectiveness when triggered at the correct time. »

« Our primary objective was breaking through the electromagnetic pulse generated within a Maelstrom cloud when human ships are approximately 50 kilometres from its centre. Data provided by intrepid pilots who survived this experience has enabled us to calibrate a shield to its specific waveform, which should allow a ship to withstand its impact. »

Aegis has confirmed that initial test flights for the Thargoid pulse neutraliser will be unmanned. Prototypes have been fitted to specially constructed probes that will be remotely launched into a Maelstrom, while technicians monitor the real-time telemetry.


* The Mystery of the Mars Assassin
The suspected 'Imperial assassin' who shot Caine-Massey CEO Johann Fleischer has been cleared of any connection to the Empire.

Executive Agent Viola Trask of the Federal Intelligence Agency gave a statement to the media:

« Our investigation has verified that the man we have in custody is a professional mercenary named Kieran Rayne , a native of the Alpha Caeli system. For over a decade, he has operated as a freelance contract killer using multiple false identities. The motive for the killing is not yet clear. »

« Despite early indications, there is no evidence that Rayne was hired by Torval Mining Ltd to eliminate Mr Fleischer. The mission was arranged anonymously via an unregistered comms network that we are unable to access. The Imperial-issue weapon and security equipment that he used were provided to him specifically for this task. This seems to be a deliberate choice to foster the impression that the assassination was ordered by elements within the Empire. »

« It has not gone unnoticed that the evidence implicating an Imperial Intelligence agent was 'too good to be true'. I'd like to stress that the FIA was fully aware of this possibility. It is unfortunate that Caine-Massey executives deployed their security forces in Tavgi before our investigation was complete. »

Congress has accepted the report and stated that no further action will be taken. It is expected that once the FIA's questioning is complete, Rayne will face a life sentence in a maximum-security prison.

Philippa Barlow-Lyons, the new CEO of Caine-Massey, addressed this development during an address to the corporation's employees:

« I know that nobody can ever replace Johann, who meant so much to us all. In his memory, I aim to run things exactly as he would have wanted. We have no choice but to accept the results of the investigation and formally withdraw our accusation against Zemina Torval and her family. I concede that grief may have gotten the better of me in recent days. But in my heart, I know that one day the truth will be laid bare, and the guilty will face Federal justice. »


* Positive Results from Maelstrom Probes
Aegis's prototype Thargoid pulse neutralisers have succeeded in allowing transit through the energy surge at the centre of a Maelstrom.

Professor Alba Tesreau made the official statement:

« Several remote-controlled probes outfitted with Thargoid pulse neutralisers were launched into the Taranis Maelstrom. The colossal electromagnetic pulse generated within the clouds should have repulsed them, but feedback confirms the probes were insulated from its effects. »

« The method used to protect the probes was discovered through research on unclassified relics recovered from Thargoid surface sites. These alien artefacts were vital to the devices' development. Initial research conducted by Ram Tah and Professor Palin proved that when receiving a modulated electrical charge, the unclassified relics emitted an energy field on similar frequencies to the Maelstrom's pulse. »

« Unfortunately, broadcasts from the probes were lost shortly afterwards. It hasn't been possible to verify what happened to them at this stage. We will repeat this experiment with other Maelstroms, but we believe that only skilled human pilots will be able to uncover what awaits within. »

Aden Tanner, who is supporting Aegis as a freelance tactical specialist, provided a supplemental report:

« My team has been conducting secondary tests with the new module installed on a manned vessel. I can confirm that when in combat against Thargoid interceptors, it protects against ship system disruption in a similar way to the existing shutdown field neutraliser. But its weight and power draw are both greater, meaning that the new module is best suited to Maelstrom exploration. »

Aegis has confirmed that it is working on establishing a production schedule for the Thargoid pulse neutraliser and intends to provide an update in the next few days.


* Convoy Tragedy Halts Superpower Conflict
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Empire and the Federation have resolved the conflict in Pichch after the accidental loss of anti-xeno supply ships.

Freelance correspondent Karleen Troy reported on events for Vox Galactica:

« Pichch is a key location to redirect front-line resources to systems facing invasion around Maelstrom Leigong. In recent days, these vital deliveries have been severely delayed by the internecine conflict. But disaster struck when an entire convoy carrying anti-xeno weaponry was destroyed by Imperial-aligned ships, which mistakenly identified them as local Federal resupply vessels. »

« Once news of the incident spread, leaders of Gauluujja Exchange and the Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum stated that they had received orders to broker an immediate ceasefire. The conflict was heading towards a Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum victory, so the sudden peace is likely a relief to Gauluujja Exchange. »

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval made a personal declaration regarding the situation:

« We permit Imperial-aligned factions a degree of autonomy, on the understanding that they do not jeopardise the Empire's strategic goals. Undermining human resistance against the Thargoid invasion cannot be tolerated. I therefore command the Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum to negotiate a ceasefire with their Federal neighbours at once. »

A similar statement was delivered by President Zachary Hudson:

« This tragic situation could and should have been avoided. Pichch is a Federal system, and we have a responsibility to sustain the flow of anti-xeno resources throughout that region. We cannot allow small-scale quarrels to derail our efforts. I have informed Gauluujja Exchange that they must arrange a peaceful resolution to their current conflict. »

Both the Federal and Imperial factions have agreed to honour their commitments to those who supported their operations, with rewards available at Tiptree Port.


* Thargoid War Update: April 3309
Jade Sanderlyn's latest report on the Thargoid invasion of the core systems has been published on Vox Galactica.

« Taking the broad view of the conflict does little to lift the spirits. Thargoid fleets now occupy well over a thousand systems, nearly 200 of which were once populated. Several million people have been killed or wounded by bombardments and caustic attacks. Colossal numbers have fled their homes as refugees. Some sources estimate that well over ten billion people have been directly affected by the war, but the misery and hardship it has caused is immeasurable. »

« As sobering as that sounds, the situation would be much worse were it not for enormous efforts by anti-xeno squadrons and independent ships, which continue to push back against the Thargoid fleets. Every day, thousands of pilots risk their lives in battle, rescuing civilians or delivering supplies. Dozens of systems have been reclaimed from the Thargoids, and there are signs that the alien expansion is gradually slowing against such resistance. »

« For a while it looked as if more traditional warfare between factions was about to bring further devastation, when Federal and Imperial proxies clashed in the Tavgi and Pichch systems. But in fact, these skirmishes helped to demonstrate how the Empire and Federation are prioritising the Thargoid threat above their centuries-long rivalry. »

« Aegis continues to focus its efforts on practical solutions. The recently announced Thargoid pulse neutraliser is an attempt to bypass the defensive barrier within the inner region of the Maelstroms. If this succeeds, what might be found lurking at their hearts? Newsfeeds are proposing destroying the Maelstroms entirely to halt the never-ending swarms of Thargoid vessels, but few experts believe this can be achieved with existing military resources. »

« As for Azimuth Biotech, without the genius of Salvation they seem unable to contribute meaningfully, despite still claiming to be the leading anti-xeno specialists. There are rumours that CEO Torben Rademaker has been in contact with several weapons and industrial manufacturers, presumably with a view to building corporate links. »

« The last five months have been one of the most devastating periods of human history. But we are also witnessing resilience and courage on truly heroic levels, and we're not beaten yet. This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Rackham Fundraiser Secures Political Backing
Independent presidential candidate Zachary Rackham held a gala ball for some of the Federation's wealthy and influential elite.

The Federal Times published a report from political correspondent Sofia Trevino:

« The extravagant gathering at Fort Rackham (formerly Fort Falkenrath) on Taylor Colony felt more like a party than a fundraiser, but its ambitions were clear. Campaign finance laws forbid Zachary Rackham from using his own wealth to pay for his presidential bid, and so connections are being forged to entice donations and other types of support. »

« Mr Rackham's campaign manager \u2013 and the originator of his 'Just Like Me' slogan \u2013 was revealed to be celebrity PR consultant Anya Blackriver. She organised many famous attendees including media barons Elias Metaxas and Neive McFarlane, the youthful but popular ICE-caster Sura Oyekan, and flamboyant business magnate 'Sir' Randolph Plaskett of the Knights of Enterprise. »

« The biggest surprise was the announcement that Congressman Harlan Turk, the highly respected representative for the Duamta system, has resigned from the Republican Party to serve as Mr Rackham's running mate. Four independent congressmen also declared that they are joining his campaign, giving the entrepreneur some genuine political clout. »

The newsfeed Sol Today published a related editorial:

« President Hudson has served with honour, and deserves our respect for keeping citizens safe in recent years. But perhaps it's time for some fresh blood at the Federation's heart? Could Zachary Rackham's infallible business instincts be what's needed to boost our economy to new heights of prosperity? »


* Resources Needed for Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis has requested materials in the YZ Ceti system to mass-produce a defence for ships entering the Maelstroms.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of the tri-superpower agency, announced the initiative at a press conference:

« Final tests have been conducted on the Thargoid pulse neutraliser, which offers ships a brief window of insulation from the energy wave encountered inside a Maelstrom. Their primary components are based on unclassified relics, which are created by interfacing Guardian artefacts with Thargoid surface sites. Ram Tah and Professor Palin have donated some of their research supplies to this project. »

« Aegis has been assigned a generous budget to purchase large quantities of cobalt, ion distributors and power converters. These will be used to create a manufacturing and distribution base, making the Thargoid pulse neutraliser commercially available on all rescue megaships. »

Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system will serve as the delivery point for all shipments. Aegis has been authorised to redeem bounty hunting vouchers for all wanted ships in the vicinity, since transporting such valuable materials is likely to attract pirates.

Representatives from the superpowers and the scientific community congratulated Aegis, while military figures emphasised the importance of finding ways to hinder or destroy the Maelstroms. Rear Admiral Daniel Parry claimed: « This is the most strategically significant breakthrough to date. It will allow us to modify our military tactics based on what is discovered inside the deadly clouds. »


* Seo Jin-ae: 'The Thargoids Know We're Coming'
A warning about entering the Maelstroms has been offered by Seo Jin-ae, whose unique cortical implant offers glimpses into the Thargoid hive mind.

Aden Tanner, who is currently working with Aegis, released a personal statement:

« Seo Jin-ae approached me in a state of distress shortly after the first tests of the Thargoid pulse neutraliser. She claimed that, as the probes passed through Taranis's energy wave, she perceived a change among the Thargoid voices. 'Like being woken up by insect bites,' was how she described the sensation. »

« 'The Thargoids aren't as oblivious to our tests as it sometimes seems,' she told me. I pressed her for more details, but there was only one thing she was convinced about: 'They understand we've found a way to push deeper into the Maelstrom. They know we're coming.' »

« Now, this might mean nothing at all, and it's not verifiable data. But it prompted Professor Tesreau to pass on Seo's concerns to the superpowers. Likewise, I feel a sense of duty to share this with the galactic community. Any pilots who plan to explore the Maelstrom cores should not assume that they'll have the element of surprise. »

Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson, the Empire's military liaison to Aegis, commented:

« I have personally reviewed all recent tactical reports, but found no evidence of any changes in the Thargoids' behaviour or strategy. We are proceeding with our plans to mass-produce the Thargoid pulse neutraliser and send crewed ships into the Maelstroms. Tanner's concern is noted, however, and we urge extreme caution in these early expeditions. »


* Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser Becomes Available
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis's new module will allow ships to penetrate the energy wave protecting the central regions of the Maelstroms.

Deliveries of cobalt, ion distributors and power converters were made to Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system. These allowed Aegis to build a manufacturing and distribution centre for Thargoid pulse neutralisers, which can now be purchased from technology brokers on rescue megaships.

Professor Alba Tesreau released a statement regarding Aegis's next steps:

« Combined with our caustic sink launcher, the Thargoid pulse neutraliser will enable explorers to travel through the Maelstroms' corrosive clouds and into their cores. A small number of Aegis researchers will be among the first wave of pioneers. Their mission is to identify the source of these mysterious objects and gather data about its nature. »

« I am conscious that, once again, independent pilots will also be risking their lives to increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. We have always been indebted to the galactic community for their bravery, and never more so for those who dare undertake this dangerous journey. Aegis will continue to provide support wherever possible. »

An additional statement was made by former Federal Navy admiral Aden Tanner:

« Whatever lies within the Maelstroms is almost certainly protected by further dangers. Judging by how swiftly our probes were disabled, the presence of human ships is likely to attract attention. I advise pilots to make sure they are outfitted with the best possible equipment before venturing within. »

Aegis confirmed that payment for all who contributed to the initiative is now available from the Orunmilla. As a related reward, the first ten Commanders who delivered unclassified relics to Ram Tah or Professor Palin in August 3308, and the 40 who have traded the greatest quantities of these objects, have been recognised for their contribution to the Thargoid pulse neutraliser's development. Each of these pilots will be invited via inbox to collect a Thargoid pulse neutraliser from storage at the Orunmilla megaship in Didiomanja.


* Into the Maelstroms
Aegis has confirmed that the first ships equipped with Thargoid pulse neutralisers have entered the inner regions of the Maelstroms.

The new module provides a temporary shield against the electromagnetic pulse that is generated when ships reach a certain point within the Maelstroms. Until now, this has prevented all attempts to identify what Thargoid constructs may exist within the caustic clouds.

Rear Admiral Daniel Parry, the Federal Navy's liaison to Aegis, reported:

« Armed ships crewed by military and xenology specialists have now been sent into each Maelstrom. These pathfinder missions will attempt to gather as much tactical and environmental data as possible. »

« We have also received information from Commanders who returned intact from the Maelstroms' core areas. We are unable to authenticate these accounts at present, but they are being collated and analysed. The Allied, Federal and Imperial high commands will authorise an official report in due course. »

A secondary statement was provided by Commodore Emil Varga, the Alliance's military liaison:

« If the preliminary data obtained by independent pilots is accurate, one common factor is that they encountered a significant Thargoid presence. Aegis warns all pilots that they enter the Maelstroms at their own risk, and should prepare for combat situations. »

« All of the eight systems containing Maelstroms are still affected by the same anti-Guardian field that was first witnessed in HIP 22460. Therefore, weapons based on Guardian technology will not function and should be replaced with other anti-xeno armaments. »


* Ground Troops Encounter Thargoid Drones
Reports from planetary settlements within Thargoid-occupied systems have described alien drone vessels attacking on-foot personnel.

Field correspondent Ernesto Rios summarised this development for Vox Galactica:

« Scores of populated systems in the vicinity of the Maelstroms have been invaded by Thargoid fleets, causing horrific casualties and mass evacuations. But military personnel still risk their lives exploring settlements within those systems, to search for survivors or scavenge remaining materials. »

« These troops have come under attack by 'airborne vehicles of Thargoid design', according to one account. Their relatively small size suggests they are the equivalent of combat drones. 'I've seen them patrol the abandoned settlements as if on guard duty,' said one eyewitness, 'and become extremely hostile when they detect any living humans.' »

« It seems that the Thargoids now view these planets as their territory, and us as the intruders. Could they be planning to colonise all worlds in the core systems? »

Following a tactical briefing with senior Aegis staff, Rear Admiral Daniel Parry provided an update to the press:

« We have obtained several reports from both enlisted and unauthorised ground teams. Available data indicates that the Thargoid drones are capable of launching volleys of air-to-surface projectiles. I have read harrowing descriptions of entire squads being wiped out by missile bombardments from these craft. »

« This potentially adds a new dimension to the war, by introducing active threats on planetary surfaces. Marine units are being prepared to investigate further. However, independent armed forces operating behind enemy lines can play a vital role by destroying as many drones as possible. »


* Thargoid Motherships Discovered Within Maelstroms
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Exploration of the inner regions of the Maelstroms has revealed the existence of colossal Thargoid constructs.

Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, published a summary on behalf of the tri-superpower initiative:

« Our pathfinder missions have verified reports by the first manned ships that used the Thargoid pulse neutraliser. We know that the core environments of all eight Maelstroms are consistent in layout and extremely dangerous. »

« Once past the energy wave, the initial hazard is an asteroid field that must be navigated. We cannot theorise an obvious reason why the asteroids have been gathered here. Thargoid vessels also patrol this region. Some reports indicate a previously unencountered class of Thargoid combat vessel accompanying interceptors and scouts. »

« Beyond these, at the centre of each Maelstrom, is a gargantuan Thargoid structure. They dwarf any singular man-made creation, even Coriolis starports. I've reviewed footage provided by our pilots, and I will admit that the architecture is unsettling. Finding a way to defeat them will be our greatest challenge to date. »

Professor Shamus Madigan of Orion University, one of Aegis's xenology specialists, added:

« Despite initial references to 'Thargoid motherships', there is little evidence to confirm exactly what purpose they serve. Based on the expansion of Thargoid invasion forces around each Maelstrom, the leading theory proposes they are fleet control centres, directing expansion efforts into our territory. Individual craft arrive and depart via several access points. Further observation is necessary to determine true nature of these gigantic entities. »

« The other popular term \u2013 'hive ship' \u2013 infers that each carries a distinct community ruled by a Thargoid Queen. While INRA scientists theorised the hierarchy of Thargoid society, the existence of such a key figure has never been confirmed. The nature and number of the Thargoids inhabiting these titanic vessels remains open for speculation. »


* Thargoid 'Hunter' Vessel Class Confirmed
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A new type of Thargoid vessel, first encountered within the Maelstroms, is interdicting ships in Thargoid controlled systems.

Aegis highlighted the threat as part of its research into the Thargoid capital ships. Commodore Emil Varga, the Allied military liaison, gave this statement:

« The first explorers to breach the Maelstroms' inner regions encountered a previously unseen Thargoid vessel, larger than a scout but smaller than an interceptor. These medium-sized craft have been categorised as hunters, with this specific class designated the 'Glaive' due to its blade-like protrusions. »

« The Glaives operated close to the motherships, so it was initially believed they acted as sentries. But in recent days they have appeared within systems under Thargoid control. Pilots lucky enough to survive these encounters report being forced out of supercruise by Glaives and aggressively attacked. »

« Personally, I believe that our newfound ability to penetrate the Maelstroms caught the Thargoids by surprise. In response, they have redeployed the mothership's defenders to a more offensive role. Such rapid tactical adaptation is not typical of this species, which is a good indicator that we have them worried. »

Aden Tanner provided more details following a research mission:

« The Glaive is extremely aggressive and attacks any human ship within range. Its high-intensity energy weapons take the form of lightning bolts, similar to a Thargoid interceptor, but this vessel is faster and more manoeuvrable. »

« Anti-xeno pilots should be advised that Glaives are also capable of disabling Guardian-based weaponry. This only became apparent when encountering them outside of the Maelstrom systems, where the Thargoids' anti-Guardian field is permanently present. »


* Presidential Campaigns Target Federal Voters
Jerome Archer, Felicia Winters and Zachary Rackham are lobbying for public support as the Federation prepares to elect a new president in August.

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino covered the race for The Federal Times:

« With Zachary Hudson's eight-year term approaching its end, citizens must decide who will be the president of the Federation by the year's end. The electoral machines for all three candidates are in full swing, with campaign slogans appearing at all Federal starports. »

« The Republican Party has pinned its hopes on current Vice President Jerome Archer, who hopes to reassure Hudson loyalists with his similar leadership style and focus on interstellar security. Shadow President Felicia Winters, head of the Liberal Party, is promising a more humanitarian approach to government policy. And the wild card is independent candidate Zachary Rackham, whose wealth and notoriety afford him a fighting chance against the political heavyweights. »

« Congress has confirmed that, with many government procedures impacted by the Thargoid war, election day has been delayed until later in the year. President Hudson is expected to remain in office for the interim period before the victor's official inauguration. »

Vox Galactica reporter Patricia Chen analysed the media coverage:

« Typically, Federal newsfeeds focus more on character than policies. The Federal Free Press obtained in-depth interviews with Winters and Isolde Rochester, while Sol Today published souvenir editions celebrating Hudson's presidency as a 'golden age'. On the fringes are those such as ICE-caster Sura Oyekan, who promotes voting for Rackham as a way to revolutionise society. »

« What is not typical is that this election is being held during wartime. The ongoing Thargoid conflict has cast a shadow over voters' optimism for the future. Some are even wondering if this might be the last president they ever elect, should the alien invasion of the core systems prove unstoppable. »


* Head of Aegis Makes Public Address
Professor Alba Tesreau has broadcast a formal statement discussing the past, present and future of Aegis.

Independent journalist Allan Mantle reported on the declaration for Vox Galactica:

« The tremendous escalation of the Thargoid war makes Aegis more open to scrutiny than ever. By delivering a personal message to the public, Professor Tesreau exhibits the transparency and accountability that the agency previously lacked. Indeed, it's to her credit that the mistakes of the past are not glossed over. »

« Some will also consider it noble that Tesreau avoids mentioning how she opposed the superpowers shutting down Aegis in favour of working with Azimuth Biotech. Others will recognise her moral high ground as mere politics. The Allied, Federal and Imperial coordinators for Aegis are all duly applauded, a tip of the hat to those who helped her resurrect the organisation. »

« Recent Thargoid discoveries are mentioned, with two having been formally classified since her speech was recorded: the Glaive-class hunters that pursue human ships, and the Revenant-class drones patrolling settlements in conquered systems. Naturally, Aegis's top priority are the Thargoid motherships, which Tesreau formally assigns the designation of 'Titan'. The statement reveals that work is underway to modify Professor Palin's xeno scanner to gather data on these alien capital ships. »

Princess Aisling Duval also delivered a statement:

« I have nothing but praise for Professor Tesreau's leadership of Aegis. She has transformed a once-failing initiative into the vanguard of humanity's defence. I am impressed and inspired by her tireless determination, which is why I sought the position of Imperial representative in the organisation. My discussions with Tesreau have convinced me that the new iteration of Aegis has addressed the concerns I once held over its strategic direction. »

« I also want to take this opportunity to honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice when resisting the Thargoids' military might. These courageous souls will never be forgotten. We all still have much work to do to protect those we care for. »

Pilots will find the Aegis Statement waiting in their ship's inbox service.


* Materials Needed for Titan Research Project
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries to the Rabh system will help mass-produce a pulse wave xeno scanner which can analyse Thargoid Titans.

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Allied scientific liaison to Aegis, outlined the initiative:

« The Thargoid capital ships, now designated as Titans, are the top priority for both military and scientific study. Reaching these gargantuan objects is hazardous since it involves travelling through the Maelstroms' corrosive environment, avoiding hostile Thargoid vessels along the way. But even at close range, ship sensors have been unable to obtain meaningful data on their composition. »

« In response, Aegis has fast-tracked a project to modify the xeno scanner originally developed by Professor Ishmael Palin. This adaption utilises the electromagnetic technology found in pulse wave analysers, casting the scanner's range over a much broader area. »

« Simulated tests show that the pulse wave xeno scanner should be able to identify points of interest on a Titan's hull. But the research effort requires as many pilots as possible to verify our findings out in the field. We are therefore gathering the supplies needed to manufacture the module in large quantities. »

Aegis will reward pilots who transport shipments of ceramic composites, polymers, gallium and indium to Muller Terminal in the Rabh system. These will be used to establish manufacturing centres for pulse wave xeno scanners, which will then be rapidly distributed to all rescue megaships. A secondary campaign will reward pilots for protecting deliveries from pirates.


* Thargoid War Update: May 3309
Vox Galactica's Jade Sanderlyn reports on the discovery of the Titans, and new Thargoid craft both in space and on occupied worlds.

« The true scale of the challenge facing humanity became evident this month, when we finally learned what was within the Maelstroms. It has long been theorised that the Thargoids have 'motherships' of some kind. But few were prepared for the shocking reality of the Titans, squatting at the centre of the corrosive clouds like bloated spiders in their webs. I can't be the only one whose guts knotted with fear when I first saw those floating monstrosities. »

« The Maelstroms also revealed a new type of Thargoid vessel, the aggressive Glaive-class hunter. Resembling multi-bladed throwing knives, these quickly drew blood as they hurled viciously into our midst. There are reports of Glaives sighted within systems that have fallen to the Thargoid invasion fleets, interdicting any ship that crosses their path. »

« Further surprises were to come within those systems, when ground troops became stalked by heavily armed drones. The Revenants, as they have been named, seem to be actively defending abandoned settlements from human intruders. Again, this contributes to the impression that the Thargoids desire a permanent presence on our worlds. »

« On a positive note, Aegis's forthcoming pulse wave xeno scanner should prove instrumental in gathering data about the Titans. A well-received public address by Professor Alba Tesreau cemented the significance of Aegis in the war, despite Azimuth Biotech's CEO Torben Rademaker somewhat predictably criticising it as 'self-congratulatory hot air'. »

« With such technological breakthroughs and fierce resistance on the front line, there's a long way to go before the Thargoids can lay claim to the core systems. This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Hadrian Duval Remarks on 'Weak Emperor'
An interview with Hadrian Augustus Duval has caused ripples in Imperial society for his direct criticism of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.

Speaking to Paresa News Network, the former Nova Imperium leader discussed the Empire's commitment to Aegis:

« I have always known that the Empire is stronger alone, especially when protecting our people from the Thargoid hordes. Supposedly, Emperor Arissa felt the same \u2013 until a visit from Princess Aisling turned her head. Suddenly her principles were cast aside, and our valuable resources pledged to more foreign military projects. »

« I can only wonder when the Emperor became so easily swayed. Was it during her year in captivity? Did all that time in suspended animation drain her resolve? We cannot afford to allow the Empire to be governed by someone with a weak spirit. Our citizens deserve a strong, determined ruler. »

Gudrun Vestergaard, royal correspondent for The Imperial Herald, commented:

« The anticipated friction between the Duval cousins has now become a reality. Hadrian clearly took great offence at how swiftly Aisling engineered an exception to the Empire's isolationist policies. But openly denigrating Her Majesty is a dangerous game, especially from the young revolutionary who once attempted to usurp her throne. »

« Meanwhile, Princess Aisling has thrown herself into the role of overseeing the Imperial contribution to Aegis. Court insiders claim that she spends much of her time with military experts, absorbing information about the Thargoid conflict. Regularly communications with her opposite numbers in the Alliance and Federation have become part of the daily routine. Some still see this as a high-profile PR exercise on her part, but others wonder if Aisling might become the wartime leader the Empire needs. Skeptics who believe she lacks the strategic talents necessary to succeed may yet find themselves surprised by her apparent enthusiasm for Aegis's work. »


* Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner Now Available
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

An initiative in Rabh has enabled Aegis to begin manufacturing a module that gathers data about the Titans.

Deliveries of ceramic composites, polymers, gallium and indium were immediately put to use mass-producing the pulse wave xeno scanner. Distribution is underway and rescue ships have already begun stocking the module.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, released a statement:

« The Thargoid Titans represent not only the greatest threat to humanity, but also the greatest scientific opportunity in a generation. Learning more about these enormous constructs could be crucial to our understanding of the Thargoid species, which I still believe is the only path to ending the war. »

« A coalition of Allied, Federal and Imperial technicians worked around the clock to modify Professor Palin's xeno scanner using pulse wave technology. Thanks to the dedication of independent pilots in providing resources, the new module has been made available in excellent time. »

« Aegis has a keen interest in all information that can be gleaned about the Titans. I sincerely hope that the data we acquire will add to our scant knowledge about the Thargoids and lead to further discoveries. »

Rewards are now available at Muller Terminal in the Rabh system for all those who transported supplies for this project.


* The Emperor's Ire
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has responded to criticism from Hadrian Duval regarding her decision to contribute to Aegis.

During a public address at the opening of a naval research and development complex on Achenar, the Emperor stated:

« For the avoidance of doubt, my decree to halt interaction with the Alliance and the Federation remains in effect. Whatever advancements in weaponry or defence are made at these impressive facilities, they will be used exclusively by the Imperial Navy to protect Imperial citizens. »

« Aegis's status as an independent agency makes it a legal exception under the Cornelius-Lasky Convention. Only a small fraction of the Empire's military expenditure is being devoted to Aegis's anti-xeno forces. »

« As for Hadrian Duval, some may recall when his Nova Imperium extremists once threatened to trigger widescale civil unrest. I chose to spare him from the fate of his co-conspirators, something Princess Aisling argued for with the same passion as she showed for the Aegis project. Unless Hadrian wishes to test my 'weak spirit' further, I strongly advise him to keep such thoughts private in future. »

The altercation between Duvals triggered some debate in the Senate, with Senator Petra Torval arguing that the Emperor clearly viewed Hadrian Duval as an 'enemy of the Empire'. The matter was settled by a statement from Chancellor Anders Blaine:

« The Treaty of Paresa binds all former members of Nova Imperium as subjects of the throne. Her Majesty has delivered a reminder that Hadrian Duval is not officially a prince of the royal family, but is nevertheless considered a loyal ally for as long as it pleases the Emperor. »


* Alliance Offers Amnesty for Far God Cultists
The Alliance Assembly has submitted an appeal for clemency to Federal Congress for followers of the Order of the Far God.

The Thargoid-worshipping faith was outlawed by the Federation in October 3308, after a failed initiative in the Popontia system to outfit a megaship named the Dedicant. Every member of the 'True Chapters' sect on board was arrested and stripped of citizenship, with FIA agents rounding up known collaborators in subsequent days. This was in accordance with the Federal constitution which forbids supporting enemies of the state, which the Thargoids are legally classified as.

As part of the request, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon stated:

« The Alliance upholds the principles of religious tolerance, and our systems are free to develop their own laws regarding faith. This means we have always welcomed the Order of the Far God, regardless of its controversial nature. While many disagree with the Order's message, their members are typically pacifists who have never sought to inflict harm on others. »

« Therefore, we propose that the Federation deports all Far God worshippers to Alliance space rather than imprison them. This could be quickly negotiated as a limited extension of existing extradition treaties. »

« As a security measure, adherents of the True Chapters and other Far God sects would be routinely checked for evidence of illegal activity. But they would otherwise be free to settle on Allied worlds and establish new communities. »

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

« In the midst of the Thargoid war, some will view this offer as bordering on traitorous. But Mahon is grasping a high-profile opportunity to distinguish the libertarian Alliance from an increasingly authoritarian Federation. If this gesture helps convince independent systems to seek Allied membership, the political gain could far outweigh the potential risk. »


* Azimuth Refocuses on Titan Research
Studying the Thargoid Titans has become a priority for Azimuth Biotech, which is keen to learn more about the alien motherships.

Director Xavier Rousseau , head of the corporation's bioscience division, was interviewed by the tech industry ICE channel On/Off Switch:

« The Thargoid Titans present us with a range of exciting unknowns. What technologies were involved in their construction? We do not know. What exactly is a Titan's hull comprised of? We cannot tell. How do the glowing openings on its superstructure work? We are not certain. Do they perform the same function as our docking bays? We can only speculate. »

« How can we find these answers? By analysing whatever fragments and residues can be obtained directly from the Titans themselves. What military breakthroughs will result? What scientific marvels could be unlocked? What commercial opportunities might arise? We at Azimuth Biotech will discover all this and more. »

An editorial in the scientific journal The Empirical commented:

« Aegis is leading the way on researching the Thargoid capital ships, as is to be expected. But even a cross-superpower agency does not have a monopoly on xenology. Azimuth, the organisation that once eclipsed Aegis entirely, remains determined to avoid falling under its rival's shadow. Many other corporate and academic entities are also devoting resources to analysing the Titans. We are witnessing a kind of scientific gold rush, a race to mine nuggets of knowledge from these mysterious ships \u2013 one that carries a significant risk to the pilots wielding the tools. »


* Far God Deportation Programme Approved
The Federation has agreed to the expulsion of all adherents of the Order of the Far God to the Alliance.

President Zachary Hudson issued a statement alongside the government decision:

« Any ideology that worships the Thargoids is destructive and treasonous, especially now we are at war with that species. I believe that rather than waste taxpayers' money keeping these deluded individuals incarcerated, the Federation is better off without them. »

« This morning I accepted Prime Minister Mahon's proposal. All former citizens known to have pledged themselves to this toxic religion will be transported beyond our borders and into the care of the Alliance. »

Security services have prioritised the True Chapters cultists currently imprisoned in the Popontia system, labelling them as high-risk compared to orthodox Far God followers. They will be escorted to Alliance space aboard the Dedicant, having agreed to provide full access to the megaship's databanks and the Order's sacred texts for Federal assessment. The Dedicant will then collect cultists held in other Federal penal facilities, ferrying them to Allied systems.

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino wrote an opinion piece for The Federal Times:

« Could there be an ulterior motive to this unexpected decision by the President? Perhaps Hudson is mindful of his legacy, with his term of office approaching its end. By tempering his 'strong man' reputation with a degree of leniency, he can better portray himself as a firm but fair leader in the Federation's history books. »


* Aegis and Azimuth Compete for Titan Samples
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Requests for tissue samples obtained from the Thargoid Titans have been made by Aegis and Azimuth Biotech.

Leon Banerjee, science correspondent for Vox Galactica, reported on the rival initiatives:

« The Titans offer a tremendous opportunity for xenological research, but carry equally significant risks. These involve passing through the Maelstroms' caustic clouds and energy barriers, avoiding Thargoid patrols, and escaping with tissue samples intact. Only the most determined pilots would undertake such missions, and the two leading anti-xeno organisations seek to attract these individuals with considerable payouts. »

« There are numerous unique materials identified so far. In this campaign, both Aegis and Azimuth Biotech are looking to acquire a large stock of tissue samples. These are recovered using research limpets at various points on the Titan's architecture, acquired from minor flaws in the Titan's highly protective outer layers. »

« Ships outfitted with a pulse wave xeno scanner and research limpet controller \u2013 or a suitable multi-limpet controller - can collect these materials. Aegis has developed its caustic sink launcher and Thargoid pulse neutraliser to pass through the Maelstrom, and will look to use further xenological resources in additional advancements. Azimuth Biotech, meanwhile, has vowed to use samples to develop 'cutting-edge military countermeasures to Thargoid aggression'. »

Pilots signed up to the Aegis initiative can deliver any Titan tissue samples to Wiberg Station in the Kioskurber system. Meanwhile, Azimuth supporters can deliver samples to Stebler City in the Djeriman system.


* Disappearance of the Dedicant
The Dedicant has disappeared from Popontia, just a few hours after thousands of Far God cultists boarded the megaship with a Federal escort.

The cultists were due for transfer aboard the vessel from Federal to Allied space, where amnesty has been offered by Prime Minister Mahon. In exchange for their release, the True Chapters sect agreed to unlock access to its secretive databanks and sacred texts prior to departure. The Dedicant instead initiated a hyperspace jump ahead of schedule, failing to arrive in the Mullag system as planned.

The Federal Navy and the Allied Defence Force both deployed search parties along the route between systems. Their initial reports stated that no signals were detected, and have found no evidence that the Dedicant was intercepted or destroyed. The megaship's current location and status remain unknown.

Executive Agent Jalen Locke  of the Federal Intelligence Agency issued a press statement:

« We have completely lost contact with the FIA security teams controlling the Dedicant. This is of grave concern, considering there are thousands of Thargoid-worshipping criminals aboard. We are operating under the assumption that the cultists somehow overpowered our people and absconded with the megaship. »

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading expert on the Order of the Far God, also spoke to the media:

« The True Chapters are undoubtedly more proactive than the Far God orthodoxy, but their nature remains essentially fatalistic. This makes it hard to imagine them taking on armed FIA agents in combat. It seems more likely that a third party was involved, although we cannot discount the possibility that the Dedicant's original owners found a way to divert its course through hyperspace. »


* Aegis Receives Titan Materials for Xeno-Research
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis and Azimuth Biotech have concluded rival campaigns to deliver tissue samples harvested from the Thargoid Titans.

Titan tissue samples were obtained from the surfaces of the Thargoid capital ships using research limpets and brought back to human space by daring pilots.

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Allied scientific liaison to Aegis, delivered a congratulatory message:

« It takes a special kind of pilot to travel through the Maelstroms and fly across the surfaces of these enormous motherships, but it seems such courage is not in short supply. The samples we received will undergo scientific testing by Allied, Federal and Imperial specialists. We are confident that they will shed light on the Titans' capabilities and the technologies used in their construction. »

A parallel campaign by Azimuth Biotech also received deliveries of Titan-based materials, but the number of shipments were notably fewer than those provided to Aegis. Observers have labelled this outcome as encouraging for Aegis's reputation, with the tri-superpower initiative failing to attract contributors away from private corporate interests in the past.

Pilots who contributed on behalf of Aegis can collect their rewards from Wiberg Station in the Kioskurber system. Supporters of Azimuth Biotech can do likewise from Stebler City in the Djeriman system.


* An Audience with the Preceptor
The Order of the Far God has reached out to Seo Jin-ae, offering information on the possible fate of the Dedicant.

The megaship was due to transport members of the True Chapters sect from the Popontia system to the Alliance-governed Mullag system, but made a hyperspace jump ahead of schedule and disappeared. The Federal Intelligence Agency has interrogated cult members still waiting in Federal prison cells, but reportedly obtained no useful information.

Days later, Aegis was directly contacted by chapters of the Order within independent space. They volunteered to discuss the Dedicant but only with Seo Jin-ae, whom they refer to as 'the Preceptor' for her ability to interpret to the Thargoid hive mind.

After meeting Far God representatives at a secure location, Seo Jin-ae made a public statement:

« The meeting wasn't as productive as the FIA hoped. I asked the cultists for information, but they wouldn't stop jabbering about their religion. They wanted me to share 'divine commandments' from the Titans, and kept asking when the Far God would arrive to cleanse the galaxy. I'll always be grateful to these people for rescuing me a few months ago, but it's hard work convincing them I'm not a prophet. »

« During the brief period I got them talking about the Dedicant, they admitted knowing nothing about a True Chapters scheme to retake the megaship. And they certainly have no clue where it is now. The meeting was mostly a waste of time. »

« One thing was possibly useful, though. Apparently, the interiors of Far God megaships are remodelled to make them 'deliberately confusing for heretics'. Corridors like insect tunnels, rooms turned into hive cells \u2013 that sort of thing. When I told them the FIA had already examined the ship's layout while it was in custody, one cultist argued they hadn't found the 'secret doors'. They explained how Theta Seven failed to get the hyperdrive working after he gained control of the Sacrosanct, and claimed the crew of that ship rigged the thing with traps. Maybe that's how the FIA agents lost control of the Dedicant. »


* Presidential Candidates Hold Live Debate
Vice President Jerome Archer, Shadow President Felicia Winters, and entrepreneur Zachary Rackham have exchanged political views in a live debate.

The Republican, Liberal and independent candidates came together for an event that was broadcast across all Federal media networks. The event provided a platform to outline each candidate's manifestos for voters, and engage in discourse on key issues.

The debate began smoothly, but did not continue in that vein as the three strong personalities clashed just a few questions in. Shortly after the broadcast, ICE channels began circulating a particularly popular segment in response to a question about Federal policy on public safety:

Archer: « Vigilance will be our watchword, and I aim to continue President Hudson's excellent record on security. »

Rackham: « Oh, is that a fact? Lost any megaships recently, Jerome? »

Archer: « It's hardly appropriate for me to comment on an ongoing FIA investigation. Although I realise that 'appropriate' may not be part of Mr Rackham's vocabulary. »

Winters: « Perhaps it is appropriate, Mr Vice President, when the Dedicant situation is a direct result of your party's repressive policies on religious expression. »

Rackham: « Woah there, ma'am! Is it any less repressive than all the tax hikes your fanciful friends will bring in? »

Winters: « Our marginal increases in taxation, mostly aimed at interstellar corporations, will result in significant reinvestment \u2013  »

Rackham: « Listen, hear me out. What our people need \u2013 what they deserve \u2013 is to pay zero civil taxes. That's right, no tax at all! What's more, I'll make sure the government co-funds every single business enterprise, large or small. »

Winters: « And after the economy collapses, how will you achieve that? By selling off the treasure you stole during your pirate days? »

Rackham: « Now that's cold even for you, Ms Winters! Firing off ICE rumours is not a good look on an elected official. »

Despite impressive viewing figures, many political commentators considered it to be 'unnecessarily personal' and 'portraying the Federation in a poor light'. A second debate is being scheduled, which promises to address these criticisms through close moderation.


* Mining Initiative Begins in Kokoller
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A campaign to attract deep space mining pilots has been launched by the Federal corporation Kokoller Limited.

With the Federation diverting considerable resources toward sustaining its anti-xeno countermeasures, some systems are looking to alternative options for sustaining stocks of raw materials. Kokoller Limited is seeking to take advantage of a strong position in its home system, by running a campaign to procure additional resources for the local economy.

Spokesperson Paul Dyson had the following to say:

« I believe that continued support of the Federal Navy's efforts to protect us is an obligation of all stellar factions. It would be in poor taste to complain or seek sympathy for the impact on our business operations while our brave military personnel risk their lives to keep us safe. »

« That said, while the galactic economy continues to function, it falls on us to maintain high incomes to fund the war via taxes and charitable contributions. One could say that maximising profits is our moral duty. Therefore, raw materials are requested to keep our refineries churning out resources. »

Kokoller Limited has invited all asteroid miners to bring shipments of bertrandite, coltan and praseodymium to Utley Hub in the Kokoller system.


* Thargoid War Update: June 3309
The latest report on the ongoing struggle against the Thargoids from Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn.

« As the war reaches its eighth month, Thargoid invasion forces occupy over a thousand systems. Billions of people have been evacuated or lost as a result. Although this ongoing conflict has made little impact on everyday life for the other side of the bubble, it continues to dominate the media. »

« The beginning of June saw the release of Aegis's latest development: the pulse wave xeno scanner. This module allows any pilots who dares approach the Titans to gather much-needed data, triggering what The Empirical referred to as a 'scientific gold rush'. We are a long way from fully comprehending the purpose of these gargantuan constructs, but the tools to do so are at least beginning to arrive. »

« Unsurprisingly, Azimuth Biotech also declared its interest in the Titans. This led to the corporation competing indirectly with Aegis to collect tissue samples directly from the hull of the Thargoid motherships. Although there was significantly greater support for the tri-superpower agency - no doubt an encouraging sign for Aegis's Professor Tesreau - Azimuth's results suggest that some retain faith in Salvation's legacy. »

« On the subject of faith, another media talking point was the recent mysterious disappearance of the Dedicant. This Order of the Far God megaship, impounded for months by the FIA, was scheduled to deport tens of thousands of imprisoned adherents from the Federation to the Alliance. But with only a few thousand on board, the ship made a sudden hyperspace jump out of Popontia. Theories abound as to its fate, ranging from a simple engine malfunction to the Far God rescuing its loyal worshippers. Even in wartime, it seems everyone loves a mystery. »

« On the front lines, of course, there is no time for such distractions. Thargoid Glaives hunt down human ships. Revenants seek to eliminate human trespassers on conquered worlds. Titans launch wave after wave of Thargoid vessels further into the core systems. Here, the focus remains locked onto the deadliest adversary we have ever faced. But the resistance is holding fast, and some traction is being made by anti-xeno forces. Systems are being recovered from alien control. There is hope that the tide is slowly turning. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Imperial Mother in Medical Emergency
Lady Florence Lavigny, the mother of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, has been placed under medical supervision following a sudden illness.

An official statement was released by the Imperial Palace:

« The Imperial Mother, Lady Florence Lavigny, has suffered an unexpected medical emergency. She is being cared for by a specialist team at her Lake Parisot estate on the planet Topaz . Details of her illness are not being shared at this time. »

« Her Majesty the Emperor has cancelled all appointments and travelled to be at her mother's side. The latest report states that Lady Lavigny has undergone surgical treatment and is in a poor but stable condition. We know that all citizens will join us in wishing the best for this prominent member of the Imperial Family. »

Royal correspondent Gudrun Vestergaard provided some background to the story:

« The Duvals always ensure that each Emperor's parents are afforded the greatest respect, not to mention the finest medical care. Although the Imperial Mother's ailment remains unspecified, not many fear it to be fatal at this early stage. »

« Though Lady Lavigny's engagement to the late Emperor Hengist Duval brought the highest of profiles, she has typically sought to avoid the spotlight. Despite this, she has repeatedly been in the eye of a media storm. In 3250, her husband Prince Aristide de Lavigny met with a mysterious accident that was never fully explained. Decades later, it was revealed that their daughter Arissa had been sired by Emperor Hengist. Upon being selected by the Senate in 3301, Arissa adopted the new surname of Lavigny-Duval to reflect her previously unknown royal heritage. »

« Princess Aisling Duval, Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval, Countess Guinevere Lavigny and many other Imperial Family members have all sent their hopes for a rapid recovery. A similar message came from Hadrian Augustus Duval, in an apparent attempt to rebuild bridges after his recent public spat with the Emperor. As the descendant of another of Hengist's affairs, perhaps Hadrian feels more of a kinship with Florence Lavigny than most others in the Duval dynasty. »


* Kokoller Mining Initiative Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A mining campaign organised by Kokoller Limited has drawn to a close, with the organisers declaring it a success.

The Federal corporation requested deliveries of bertrandite, coltan and praseodymium to supply the Kokoller system's refinery base, ostensibly to manufacture supplies for the Federal Navy's anti-xeno war efforts.

Spokesperson Paul Dyson provided a message to participants:

« It is genuinely a pleasure to see so many pilots respond to our call for raw materials. Harvesting those asteroid belts is no easy task, but the performance has been remarkable. I can promise all those involved in the campaign that the profits raised from refining and distributing these resources will go to a very worthy cause. Those credits are in good hands. »

Kokoller Limited has confirmed that all contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Utley Hub in the Kokoller system.


* Azimuth Plans Corporate Convention
Azimuth Biotech has announced an invitation-only event for prospective business partners and military liaisons.

CEO Torben Rademaker provided a statement to the media:

« New opportunities have emerged for Azimuth to resume the lead in anti-xeno operations. With Thargoid fleets rampaging through the core systems, and Aegis's questionable policy of providing utility modules over increased firepower, humanity's defence once again falls to us. But our organisation will no longer work in solitude. »

« I have extended the hand of partnership to selected financiers, military figures, research groups and manufacturing companies. They are invited to convene and discuss methods of helping us to resist the evil of the Thargoids. »

Business analyst Marlon Royce published this report via Vox Galactica:

« Ostensibly, this appears to be a public relations exercise for Azimuth Biotech. However, the company's relative lack of support from independent pilots in a recent Thargoid tissue sample initiative has accelerated the company's search for allies. Rumours among the tech community hint that the convention precedes the announcement of a weapon schematic redesign to whet the appetite of investors. »

« Azimuth is using private couriers to transport guests to and from the convention, entirely at its own expense. This generous professional courtesy also guarantees anonymity for attendees, making it difficult to determine who is on Rademaker's guest list. Given nerves over Operation Wych Hunt disruption, this seems a wise choice. »

« We do know that Herculean Machines and Space Lanes Cargo are sending representatives. Aanya Gupta, CEO of Holloway Bioscience Institute, also agreed to meet with the rival xeno-researcher. But the rest are avoiding being publicly associated with Azimuth Biotech, which faced enormous criticism for its role in the Battle of HIP 22460 and the Thargoids' subsequent retaliation. »


* Deliver Rarities for Azimuth Event
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Azimuth Biotech has requested shipments of rare commodities to Xi Wangda, as luxury supplies for its business convention.

Torben Rademaker, CEO of the anti-xeno corporation, announced the initiative via public channels:

« We expect this prestigious gathering to be attended by many representatives from research groups, manufacturing companies and military forces. To ensure that our esteemed guests are made welcome, we will pay handsomely for shipments of Albino Quechua Mammoth Meat, Gilya Signature Weapons and Harma Silver Sea Rum. »

« The cornerstone of this event will be the commercial launch of Azimuth's newly modified ship-mounted weapon: the pre-engineered Overcharged Gimballed AX Multi-Cannon with Auto Loader. Our proprietary redesign will make a significant contribution when engaging Thargoid vessels in combat. Those who contribute the greatest number of rare goods will be rewarded with some of these revolutionary modules. »

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, who coordinates the Alliance's involvement with Aegis, remarked on Azimuth's campaign during an interview for the Old Worlds Gazette:

« Anything that increases survivability against the Thargoids is surely welcome. But it does grind a little when it comes from the same organisation that escalated the war so significantly. »

« Furthermore, Mr Rademaker is placing a positive spin on Azimuth's connections with third parties, rather than admit that it is a necessity. Activist groups such as Operation Wych Hunt have diminished the corporation's stellar influence in recent months. Their actions might have forced Azimuth to rely on external support in order to compete with Aegis. »

Pilots can make their deliveries to Musashi in the Xi Wangda system. Azimuth Biotech has acknowledged that transporting these valuable items increases the likelihood of being targeted by pirate forces. The corporation will therefore offer a further reward for redeeming bounty vouchers at Cartier City on wanted ships in the system, in order to maintain local security.


* Presidential Candidates Outline Manifestos
The three candidates in the Federal presidential election have taken part in a second live debate to discuss policies.

The event was more closely moderated than the first debate in June. The candidates discussed their campaigns in detail, with minimal interruption from their rivals.

Republican Party candidate Jerome Archer is the current vice president and a former director of the Federal Intelligence Agency. He explained his intentions to tighten security and increase military spending:

« Shielding citizens from external threats, whether human or alien, is always my top priority. Ms Winters lacks any significant achievements in her political career, if we're honest. Whereas I can refer to many successes \u2013 such as the Proactive Detection Bureau \u2013 which prove I am a man of my word. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters, leader of the Liberal Party, was previously the secretary of state in Jasmina Halsey's administration. She outlined her plans to reinvest in civil infrastructure by increasing corporate taxation:

« Our economic model will look to increase tax revenue generated by large corporations, greatly improving the quality of life for billions of people through public service investment. Mr Archer's obsession with police-state programmes can only push the Federation further toward an authoritarian dystopia. »

Independent candidate Zachary Rackham is a well-known business magnate, who privately owns many Federal companies. His campaign pledges have proved highly popular, but remain light on detail:

« Is anyone else as bored of these two windbags as I am? All politicians do is make empty promises, but I'm in the business of giving people what they want. As president, I'll make every single person rich and successful, just like \u2013 say it with me, come on \u2013 just like me! »

All three candidates pledged to prioritise funding for the Federal Navy's anti-xeno efforts until the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids reaches a conclusion.

In related news, Congress confirmed that the election date has been shifted again. Refugee advocacy groups have argued that all residents of Federal systems lost to Thargoid invasion are entitled to vote, and the active re-registration of this demographic in new territories has forced a further delay. The election is now expected to be held in the last quarter of 3309.


* The Hunt for the Dedicant
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Traces of a distress call from the Dedicant megaship have been detected in the LP 714-58 system.

Vice Admiral Amir Rafiq, a spokesperson for the Imperial Navy, broadcast an announcement on all public channels:

« An Imperial scout ship travelling through LP 714-58 has intercepted several fragmentary signals. Their identifying markers confirmed that they originated from the Dedicant. We believe there has been an encryption error in the system's communication beacons, which prevented the distress call from being rerouted to its intended destination in the Federation. »

« Officially, the Imperial Navy no longer performs joint operations with our Federal counterparts. Nor do we involve ourselves in the activities of the illegal Far God cult. Nevertheless, we are sharing this information as a humanitarian gesture. Our hope is that this may aid a rescue mission for those trapped aboard the lost megaship. »

The Dedicant made an unscheduled hyperspace jump from the Popontia system on the 15th of June, while imprisoned members of the Order of the Far God were being transferred onboard to be relocated in the Alliance.

Executive Agent Jalen Locke of the Federal Intelligence Agency released a statement:

« It is unexpected to receive any kind of assistance from the Empire, but on this occasion we are grateful. Three security teams, comprised of 50 agents each, are currently on the Dedicant along with over 8,000 cultists. This is the first indication that the megaship remains intact and that our people are calling for help. »

« FIA specialists are en route to the LP 714-58 system. However, deciphering interstellar comms signals is a difficult and time-consuming task. We would appreciate any assistance from independent pilots if they are able to detect any further messages. »


* Azimuth Releases New AX Weapon
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Rare goods delivered to Xi Wangda helped ensure that Azimuth Biotech's arms convention was a success.

CEO Torben Rademaker confirmed the initiative's completion:

« From today, the Overcharged Gimballed AX Multi-Cannon with Auto Loader is available at all rescue megaships, as well as Azimuth Biotech's core markets.  I am confident that this will prove useful those brave pilots who enter combat with Thargoid ships. Once again, my company has proved that its ingenuity and experience in developing anti-xeno weaponry cannot be surpassed. »

« I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all of the corporate, financial and military representatives who attended the convention. Many fascinating proposals were discussed, most of which must remain commercially confidential for now. Suffice to say, the future for Azimuth Biotech and our partners looks bright. »

« Finally, the event was helped enormously by the supplies of Albino Quechua Mammoth Meat, Gilya Signature Weapons and Harma Silver Sea Rum, as well as those who eliminated criminal elements in the Xi Wangda system. I have authorised reimbursement for delivered goods from Musashi and bounty vouchers from Cartier City. »

Newsfeeds, business analysts and ICE channels have discussed the clandestine nature of Azimuth Biotech's convention. Some wondered if the corporation would be able to function without external financing. Others suggested that cooperation with mainstream companies may rehabilitate Azimuth in the eyes of the superpowers.

The attendance of senior staff from the Holloway Bioscience Institute has also raised eyebrows within the scientific community. An editorial in The Empirical remarked: « Holloway's expertise in studying vacuum-dwelling life forms is almost unparalleled. If Azimuth were to forge closer ties with the institute, the resulting xenological research capabilities might even surpass those of Aegis. »


* Dedicant Quest Yields Results
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The missing megaship Dedicant is close to being located after fragments of its distress call were tracked down.

The scrambled messages were discovered on comms beacons in the LP 714-58, Wuniez, Olurung and Kwakimo systems. Combined decryption efforts eventually led to another beacon in the HIP 19912 system, where the Dedicant's original transmission was revealed:

FEDERAL ESCORT TEAM ALPHA

ASSIGNED TO ORDER OF THE FAR GOD MEGASHIP 'DEDICANT'

PRISONER TRANSFER MISSION HAS FAILED

SIGNIFICANT NON-LETHAL DEFENSIVE MEASURES ENCOUNTERED

MAJORITY OF ORDER OF THE FAR GOD PRISONERS ESCAPED

PRISONERS INITIATED DEDICANT HYPERDRIVE

ESCORT TEAMS ALPHA, BRAVO, CHARLIE AND CULTISTS REMAIN ON BOARD

'DEDICANT' CURRENT LOCATION UNKNOWN

ADVISE TRACING METADATA COORDINATES TO THIS MESSAGE

REQUEST IMMEDIATE FEDERAL NAVY ASSISTANCE

Vice Admiral Amir Rafiq of the Imperial Navy provided an update:

« Imperial Intelligence specialists are currently analysing the comms beacon in HIP 19912 to trace the message to its point of origin.   We have orders not to commence any joint operations with the Federation, but I am authorised to make our findings public. »

Executive Agent Jalen Locke of the Federal Intelligence Agency told the media:

« We appreciate the assistance from the Empire  , and from all the independent pilots who helped find this distress call. It has confirmed our theory that the prisoners managed to regain control of their former vessel, using various modifications made to its internal systems. »

« FIA security teams are standing by to launch a rescue mission as and when the Dedicant's location is pinpointed. They will retake the megaship by force if necessary and detain   all Far God cultists onboard. »


* Thargoid War Update: July 3309
Vox Galactica journalist Jade Sanderlyn reports on the latest news emerging from the front lines of the conflict.

« Events in the war continue to move quickly, sometimes outpacing the 'speed of news'. In my last update, I mentioned that the Thargoids had occupied over a thousand systems. But by the time that was published, the number had reduced considerably. According to my sources, anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots are reclaiming systems at a higher rate than Thargoids can conquer them. »

« This incredible achievement suggests we are finally gaining the advantage in this war. The hopelessness that many have felt over the last nine months is now tempered with optimism. Our naval forces are proving that the alien fleet is not undefeatable. »

« My sources also passed on some unsettling stories from pilots working beyond the frontline systems. A few of them seem to think that the Thargoids' interest in occupied escape pods \u2013 which is well documented \u2013 has recently increased. Apparently, there have been claims that Thargoid vessels went out of their way to abduct escape pods launched from ships damaged in battle. »

« These are little more than unsubstantiated rumours, of course, and not something I would usually include in a factual report. But we know so little about the Thargoids that even circumstantial changes in their behaviour might be significant. And I can't be the only one who finds such tales chilling. »

« Otherwise, the most significant news this month was Azimuth Biotech's corporate convention and the launch of its AX module redesign. Aegis clearly has the lead in both public sentiment and government support at this time, but it seems like Azimuth has no intention of ceasing its contributions to the war effort anytime soon. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* The Fate of the Dedicant
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The lost megaship Dedicant has been located in HIP 19600, with signs of Thargoid attack and all inhabitants missing.

The Dedicant was being prepared by Federal authorities to deport imprisoned members of the Order of the Far God when it unexpectedly jumped into hyperspace. Pilots who helped decipher its fragmented distress call were informed of the recent discovery by the Imperial Navy.

Executive Agent Jalen Locke of the Federal Intelligence Agency issued a statement:

« We can confirm that the Dedicant has been discovered adrift in the HIP 19600 system. There is evidence that the Thargoids penetrated the hull in multiple locations, and thousands of escape pods were launched. Unusually, there are no bodies onboard and we have not been able to locate any of the escape pods. The whereabouts of all three FIA security teams and over 8,000 Far God cultists cannot be determined. »

« A series of personal logs, portraying some harrowing experiences, are helping us to piece together what happened during the Dedicant's disappearance. We are liaising with military intelligence to learn more. »

In related news, Aegis made an announcement on all public channels:

« Independent observers have detected a new type of Thargoid vessel operating within the Maelstroms. Little is known of their capabilities as yet. They have been provisionally classified as a 'hunter' due to their size, which is similar to the Glaive. »

« Aegis has only corroborated sightings of these ships in close proximity to the Thargoid Titans. However, we have received reports that they may be active elsewhere. Pilots are advised to exercise maximum caution if they encounter these vessels. »


* Cultists Blamed for Dedicant Tragedy
President Zachary Hudson has accused the Order of the Far God of being directly responsible for the fate of the Dedicant megaship.

« Our assessment of these Thargoid-worshipping extremists has been proved correct, » he told The Federal Times. « Hijacking the Dedicant to deliver it to their alien gods is an act of treason and mass murder. »

« I have ordered the Proactive Detection Bureau to root out every deluded individual with sympathies for this twisted cult. Automatic life sentences will ensure that these traitors never again put innocent people at risk. »

The declaration brought political pressure on all three presidential candidates to state their intentions for the Far God cult should they be elected.

Vice President Jerome Archer: « I will be pleased to continue President Hudson's policy on dealing with these religious fanatics: stricter controls, increased surveillance and tougher sentences. »

Shadow President Felicia Winters: « Regardless of their misguided beliefs, thousands of former citizens also lost their lives during this Thargoid attack. I am lobbying for an independent security review into these tragic events. »

Zachary Rackham: « Hear me out. There's a simple solution to all this. When I'm president, only criminals will pay tax. That'll be a far more effective deterrent than imprisonment! »

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, an expert on the Order of the Far God, observed that the cultists had no way of communicating with the Thargoids: « The deeply distressing logs found on the Dedicant prove that the arrival of the Thargoids was unexpected, and certainly not the rapturous experience they believed it would be. »

The Federal Intelligence Agency is continuing to investigate the Dedicant in the HIP 19600 system. The Alliance's amnesty programme with the Federation has been officially halted, but the Far God religion remains legal in most Allied territories.


* Thargoid Scythes Undertake 'Human Harvest'
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A new type of Thargoid vessel is hyperdicting human ships and capturing living passengers.

Aegis has designated the hunter-class alien ship as a 'Scythe'. Aden Tanner released an assessment of its capabilities:

« This Thargoid vessel has been designed not just for combat, but to hyperdict ships and extract human beings from them. Our observations of its tactics suggesting that abduction is its primary purpose. »

« A Scythe's initial attack  mirrors that of its Glaive cousin, by attempting to disable frame shift drives and deplete shields. It then launches a unique strike to makes passenger cabins and cargo holds uninhabitable. The resulting escape pods are rapidly drawn onboard onto the Scythe intact. »

Further observations were made by Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson, the Empire's military liaison to Aegis:

\Due to their modus operandi, it now seems likely that the Dedicant's population was forced to abandon the megaship and subsequently abducted en masse by these vessels. »

« The Thargoids have been capturing escape pods for years, but now it seems to have become a strategic priority. Perhaps they view 'harvesting' us in the same way as obtaining meta-alloys from barnacle sites. We can only imagine what unpleasant intentions they have for living human specimens. »


* Aegis Investigates Missing Populations
An analysis of survivors from recent Thargoid conflicts and invasions has raised the possibility of human abductions on a colossal scale.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, delivered a personal statement to the media:

« A few months ago I was contacted by Zuri Afolayan , a senior analyst for Safeguard Interstellar. Her job involves collating civil and military data to determine where emergency aid is most needed. She had identified consistent discrepancies between the registered populations of Thargoid-occupied systems and all confirmed deaths, refugees and stranded survivors. »

« Aegis performed detailed comparisons of Ms Afolayan's findings with other sources. This led to one inescapable conclusion: tens of millions of people have vanished since the start of the war. »

« No doubt many deaths have gone unrecorded, and many others have fled into deep space. But the recent appearance of the Scythe-class hunter, coupled with events aboard the Dedicant megaship, suggest that at least some have been taken into captivity. »

« I am very conscious that this statement may be seen as alarmist and speculative. But our xenologists and strategists are considering the implications of a mass abduction programme by the Thargoids. Any opportunity to recover these lost souls will be explored as a priority. »

Field correspondent Ernesto Rios published his observations via Vox Galactica:

« It's a well-documented fact that Thargoid vessels occasionally take onboard occupied escape pods. But Aegis now believes that the aliens are no longer just attacking humanity \u2013 they are attempting to capture us alive en masse. »

« What are we to them? Prisoners of war? Food for their young? Fuel for their biomechanical technology? Or is this just misinterpreted data and battlefield rumours? In my career I have heard many of these, and in this instance I'm praying that is the case. »


* Distant Thargoid Encounter Raises Questions
An independent explorer has reported an unusual incident involving a Thargoid vessel, hundreds of light years away from the ongoing invasion.

Commander Renia Rakowski  told her story to Vox Galactica:

« I'd been gathering exploration data for weeks without seeing another soul. Boring, I know, but I like a quiet life. As I jumped out of the Wregoe GA-X B3-0 system, my ship rocked violently and I panicked, thinking the hyperdrive had failed. I barely saw it at first, black against the black of space, until its outline glowed. A Thargoid interceptor. Just like on the newsfeeds, but right outside my canopy. »

« I've never been in combat before, and my ship carries no weapons anyway, so I thought this was the end of me. My heart was drumming as I stared at the alien, and it stared back like some giant lidless eye. A writhing light lashed out, this rasping howl came over the comms, and then\u2026 it left. I wasn't dead, which was quite the surprise. »

« I watched it gliding away, its petals rotating and revolving, sort of beautifully I suppose. It actually turned its back on me, like I was some insignificant speck unworthy of attention. I've never been so glad to be boring. »

Commodore Emil Varga, the Alliance's military liaison to Aegis, provided a follow-up statement:

« This incident took place a considerable distance from the Maelstroms. Initially, we feared this was evidence that new Titans had arrived and were performing a flanking manoeuvre. However, if the interceptor had been part of the invasion fleets, it would have opened fire immediately after hyperdiction occurred. »

« The immediate area around Wregoe GA-X B3-0 contains no barnacle sites or records of Thargoid activity that we're aware of. Universal Cartographics confirmed we have some basic exploration data for that part of the Wregoe sector, but no previous Thargoid encounters. Civilians are warned to stay away from that region until we know more. »


* Alien Abduction Evidence Increases
Newsfeeds and ICE-casts have reacted to Aegis's theory that the Thargoids have purposefully captured tens of millions of living humans.

Eyewitness testimonies provided by independent pilots have given credence to this theory. Citizens' Chronicle featured the following account from Imperial auxiliary Commander Luca Redondo:

« It was a sickening sight, watching Scythes hunt down survivors. A part of me wanted to start blasting the escape pods rather than let those poor people be eaten, or experimented on, or whatever the hell the Thargoids want them for. There was nothing my squadron could do to save them, not without risking the refugees we were carrying. I don't think I'll be sleeping well for a long time. »

Many reporters have interviewed people still waiting to hear from those who once lived in Thargoid-occupied systems. Vox Galactica has published several such stories:

« My ex-husband took our kids to visit his family last November, just before the Maelstroms arrived. Their last message was so happy, telling me their adventures, promising to call me tomorrow. But there was no tomorrow. Just static from the entire system. Every day since then I've contacted the refugee centres, repeating their names over and over. It's my whole life now. There's nothing else. »

An editorial in The Federal Free Press called for greater pressure to be placed on Aegis and the authorities:

« It's outrageous that this was kept out of the public domain for so long, with the Thargoids taking prisoners for months. Why was this suppressed by those in power? We owe it to those millions of people to do everything we can to rescue them. »

An alternative viewpoint was outlined by Timothy Culver, a prominent xeno-peace activist, on his ICE-cast channel:

« Humans have been capturing and experimenting on Thargoids since we first encountered them, so we certainly don't occupy the moral high ground. But I also believe that they are primarily seeking to understand us. I urge everyone to study Commander Rakowski's recent report, which proves that not every Thargoid vessel sees us as an enemy. »


* Ancient Alien Battleground Discovered
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Wreckage from a past conflict between the Guardian and Thargoid races has been found in the Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 system.

The crashed remains of Thargoid vessels, alongside structures of Guardian origin, are located on Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 1 c. Conflict between the two species occurred millions of years ago, but physical evidence of this is extremely rare. The only comparable site, in the Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 system, was initially found two centuries ago by the Azimuth Biochemicals ship Proteus and rediscovered in 3307.

Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 was one of several systems under investigation following a report by Commander Renia Rakowski, who encountered a Thargoid interceptor in nearby Wregoe GA-X B3-0.

The Holloway Bioscience Institute has sent teams into the area to explore the possibility of xenoarchaeological research. Dr Jeong-Hui Shin gave a statement to The Sovereign newsfeed:

« It is fascinating that none of the Thargoid vessels operating in this region are immediately aggressive. One of our theories is that they are still following million-year-old orders to attack the Guardians. Therefore, from their perspective, humans are an unknown species and not identified as an enemy. Alternatively, they may be pursuing non-combat functions such as meta-alloy harvesting, as with the Thargoids that can still be found in some nebulas. »

Prominent xeno-peace advocates including Timothy Culver, Bernadette Wells and Dev Venkatesh  have called for further study of the area. They claim that this is « an opportunity for non-hostile interactions with the Thargoids, » who may have developed « an autonomous subculture that is more amenable to coexistence with humanity, providing certain boundaries are respected. »

Other pro-peace groups have demanded that naval forces should not be sent into the region, as the Thargoids may view this as a provocation. At present, Aegis is focused entirely on gathering information and is not aware of any anti-xeno deployments against Wregoe BU-Y b2-0.


* Duvals Rally Around Imperial Mother
Lady Florence Lavigny is recuperating from a serious illness, but the experience has prompted her to call for changes within the Imperial Family.

Official sources confirmed that the Imperial Mother remains under constant medical supervision at her home on Topaz, following a successful surgical procedure. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has now returned to the Imperial Palace on Capitol, and is being regularly updated about her mother's condition.

Countess Guinevere Lavigny, cousin to the Emperor and niece of Lady Lavigny, also visited Topaz. She told a local reporter:

« My aunt is now able to communicate properly for short periods, and is dwelling on the past a great deal. She talks about wanting to bring together our entire family, and resolving minor disagreements which have lingered for too long. This is something that my brother Lucius  and I have always felt is long overdue, so I hope she gets her wish. »

The Imperial Herald's royal correspondent Gudrun Vestergaard speculated:

« Uniquely, Florence Lavigny has earned the respect of everyone connected to the Imperial Family over the past decade. She alone could heal the rifts between Emperor Arissa, Princess Aisling and Hadrian Duval, which have become more pronounced in recent months. Minor members of the Empire's ruling dynasty might also find their fortunes changed by the Imperial Mother's plans. »

« It's worth remembering that the details of Lady Lavigny's illness were never made public. Are her calls for unity prompted by thoughts of mortality? Perhaps time is of the essence if she seeks to make lasting changes to the House of Duval. »


* The Case Against 'Calico Zack'
Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco has renewed her investigation into Zachary Rackham, seeking to invalidate him from the Federal presidential race.

« Thirty years ago, the mysterious 'Calico Zack' gained a reputation as a notorious pirate lord. In some backwaters, tales are still told of how he personally led countless raids against cargo ships and passenger liners. Allegedly there were very few casualties in his wake, since the pirate always focused on hijacking valuables rather than causing bloodshed. »

« As Calico Zack's wealth and influence grew, Archon Delaine viewed him as a threat and planned to go to war. This may be what prompted him abandon piracy. He laundered his ill-gotten gains via shell corporations and stock investments, reinventing himself as Federal entrepreneur Zachary Rackham. »

« Since those days \u2013 which he now claims were spent as a struggling trader \u2013 Rackham has become a trillionaire. He has absorbed companies, funded grandiose structures, and plastered his name wherever he could. Rackham Capital Investments is largely run by former pirate comrades turned businessmen, which has led to a few violent 'resignations' over the years. »

« Rackham's presidential candidacy has inspired me to redouble my efforts to expose his criminal past. I cannot imagine what the Federation will become if he is elected to high office. »

The Federal Times has come under fire from Zachary Rackham's supporters, claiming it is acting on the orders of his political rivals. An editorial in rival newsfeed Sol Today said:

« Bryanna Blanco was once a highly respected reporter, but should be facing libel charges for this kind of mudslinging. She has pursued a years-long vendetta against Rackham with very little to show for it, and her articles often recycle discredited conspiracy theories. »

A Federal Intelligence Agency spokesperson stated:

« Mr Rackham is a long-standing member of the FIA Civilian Oversight Board. There has never been any evidence that might cause us to open a criminal investigation into his activities. »


* Deliveries Requested to Commemorate Duval Family
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Shipments of precious materials are needed in the Laedla system to build statues honouring the House of Duval.

Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval made a public announcement to launch the initiative:

« We are all relieved that our beloved Imperial Mother is on the path to recovery. In such times, we must remember how much all citizens owe to the Duval dynasty, whose thousand-year reign has brought peace and prosperity to trillions. »

« In honour of Her Majesty the Emperor and all those who came before her, I am arranging for mighty statues to adorn the public plazas of many Imperial worlds. Using the finest quality gold, jadeite and platinum, we will construct impressive monuments to the architects of our glorious Empire. »

The Imperial Herald published a related piece by royal correspondent Gudrun Vestergaard:

« Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval is the son of Prince Baylor Duval, one of Emperor Hesketh's brothers, who married into the House of Lombardo nearly a century ago. This offshoot branch of the Imperial Family are survivors of the mass assassinations perpetrated by the NMLA, as a result of which their prominence among the nobility has risen. »

« Emperor Arissa has given the statues her personal blessing, but the mood within the palace is mixed. Some view Archduke Otto as having delusions of grandeur. Others consider him an opportunist looking to ingratiate himself with more prominent family members. But perhaps this is a simple gesture in good faith \u2013 a swift response to Florence Lavigny's request for unity within the royal family. »

The required resources can be delivered to Kummer Acropolis in the Laedla system. Laedla Empire Assembly, which is providing logistical support and security for the project, will redeem bounty vouchers for wanted ships in the system.


* Rackham Refutes Rumours
Presidential candidate Zachary Rackham has denied allegations that he was a notorious pirate lord prior to becoming an entrepreneur.

Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco has long maintained that the business magnate gained his initial fortune by means of piracy. She recently announced that she was renewing efforts to prove his criminality, thereby invalidating him from holding the presidency under Federal electoral laws.

In an exclusive interview with Sol Today, Mr Rackham addressed the situation:

« I've always been highly amused by these stories, which make out that I was some kind of swashbuckling corsair in my youth. No doubt they've helped boost sales of The Federal Times. »

« But in the Federation, we have laws to protect innocent people \u2013 just like me! \u2013 from libellous accusations. It's time for Ms Blanco to discard her poisonous obsession with me, or I'll be forced to defend my good name through legal means. Hey, if she needs a good source of income, my campaign could always find use for an imaginative speech writer! »

In response, The Federal Times published a personal article by Bryanna Blanco:

« Rackham does have one genuine talent: covering his tracks. With all his money and resources, he's erased all evidence of his past. I've interviewed plenty of victims and witnesses, but most of my discoveries won't stand up in court against his powerful legal team. »

« So, with special funding provided by my editor, I've turned to the professionals. The Wallglass Investigations Agency has been hired to prove that Rackham operated as a pirate lord. If they can't find irrefutable proof, nobody can. And if I'm proved wrong, then Calico Zack can take his shot at stealing the entire Federation. »


* Thargoid War Update: August 3309
Vox Galactica's Jade Sanderlyn reviews developments in the ongoing war against the Thargoids.

« There have been some impressive territorial gains against the Thargoids in recent weeks. The number of systems controlled by the Titans' invasion fleets has tumbled, allowing many millions of people to return to their homes. This is largely thanks to coordinated action by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. »

« However, I take no pleasure in reporting that the 'unsubstantiated rumours' I discussed last month are true. The Thargoids' increased interest in capturing escape pods has been verified, with the appearance of a new vessel designed for this very task. Scythe-class hunters are now launching attacks en masse, using a combination of unique hull-breaching munitions and recovery drones to abduct living people. »

« It's believed that the Scythes were responsible for the disappearance of thousands aboard the Dedicant. There's a horrific irony that most of these abductees were members of the Order of the Far God, finally getting their wish to be saved by their 'angels'. From the logs found aboard the megaship, adrift in the HIP 19600 system, there was nothing holy about the experience. »

« It's fair to say that these latest revelations are further proof of the fluid nature of the war. They prove that the Thargoids are still adapting their tactics to the current challenge humans provide. What purposes they may have for human specimens remains unknown. But the psychological impact of that mystery \u2013 not knowing what they're doing with the people they capture \u2013 will weaken the morale of many anti-xeno fighters. »

« Another discovery this month was a planetary site in the Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 system. This contained both Guardian ruins and crashed Thargoid vessels, and is only the second of its kind ever recorded. More intriguingly, Thargoids active in the region are not attacking human ships on sight. »

« Several pilots told me that this is still normal Thargoid behaviour near some of our populated nebula colonies. But xeno-peace activists feel that this discovery presents an opportunity. The Holloway Bioscience Institute is already planning an independent research expedition to the area. We'll be watching what happens there very closely. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Now more than ever, stay safe out there. »


* Human Presence Causes Thargoid Withdrawal
The Thargoids have unexpectedly abandoned the region around Wregoe BU-Y b2-0, mere days after being discovered.

They were believed to be present due to an ancient site on the planet Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 1 c, which hosted a conflict between Guardian and Thargoid forces millions of years ago. Aegis has confirmed reports that all Thargoids have now disappeared from that area of space. Aden Tanner delivered a summary:

« Our pilots can no longer detect a single Thargoid ship anywhere in that region. In military terms, they have undertaken a full tactical withdrawal. It usually requires overwhelming firepower to drive out Thargoid forces, especially from multiple systems. In this case, there was no fleet action or anti-xeno operation sufficiently large to cause this response. »

Dr Jeong-Hui Shin of the Holloway Bioscience Institute observed:

« This is atypical behaviour for the Thargoid species. Their territorial instincts are usually aggravated by the arrival of humans, as witnessed in several of the nebula colonies. It is unprecedented for them to avoid engaging us in battle. We can only theorise that their purpose for being in this region was interrupted, perhaps even invalidated, by our presence. »

Dev Venkatesh, a prominent xeno-peace advocate and former lecturer at Orion University, told Vox Galactica:

« Frankly, this is a disappointing development. Here was a chance to observe this intelligent race in a non-combat environment, but it's clear that our ships disrupted the Thargoids' plans. I find it encouraging, however, that they chose to simply retreat instead of fight. We must hope that a similar opportunity will one day present itself, and perhaps we can approach it with greater caution. »


* Aegis Leak Confirms Vanishing Populations
A private discussion among Aegis leadership regarding mass Thargoid abductions has been made public.

Recordings of Professor Alba Tesreau, Aden Tanner and Seo Jin-ae were sent to and published by all newsfeeds, including the Pilots' Federation. File data shows that their conversation took place shortly before Professor Tesreau's statement to the media on July 18th, in Alba Tesreau's office at Aegis headquarters in Duamta.

After a brief period of speculation, Seo Jin-ae herself confirmed that she released the logs. Seo indicated that rumours circulating on 'alternative ICE channels' of Aegis withholding information from the public were false, and that Tesreau intended to announce evidence of human abductions even before the Dedicant tragedy brought the news to prominence.

Ernesto Rios analysed the new information in an article for Vox Galactica:

« Leaks of classified information are nothing new, but it is rare that they support rather than damage the target organisation. According to these recordings, the topic of millions of people missing from Thargoid-invaded systems was carefully considered prior to Aegis informing the public. »

« A significant revelation relates to the visions experienced by Seo Jin-ae. She tells Tesreau and Tanner: 'An image keeps repeating\u2026 Rows and rows of what I thought were eggs.' But then clarifies: 'They're pods. Containers for humans.' Seo claims that abducted people are being kept alive aboard the Titan motherships. The reason remains unknown, though Seo insists the abductees are 'important to the next phase of the Thargoid invasion.' »

« Tanner then queries that Aegis might develop a way to recover these pods. We have yet to see confirmation that Aegis is investigating this possibility. But the prospect of extracting prisoners from within the fearsome Titans will only appeal to the most courageous or foolhardy pilots. »


* Materials Received to Construct Duval Statues
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A campaign by a minor Imperial Family member to deliver precious materials to Laedla has concluded.

The shipments of gold, jadeite and platinum will be used to construct statues of Duval family members, to be erected in public spaces in planetary cities across the Empire.

The project is the brainchild of Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval, who announced:

« I am deeply grateful to all the pilots who mined or transported the resources we required. Work has already begun to forge them into beautiful works of art, commemorating past Emperors and other noble holders of the Duval name. »

« It is my honour to confirm the first two statues will be of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, located in the palace's central plaza on Capitol, and of Lady Florence Lavigny, placed within the main square of Topaz's capital city alongside the memorial sculpture of Emperor Hengist. »

Laedla Empire Assembly is now offering payment to those who delivered the required materials to Kummer Acropolis in the Laedla system. Bounty vouchers for all wanted ships destroyed within the system will also be redeemed.


* Wallglass to Probe Rackham's Past
The Federal Times has hired the Wallglass Investigations Agency to prove that presidential candidate Zachary Rackham was once a pirate lord.

Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco has long claimed that the business magnate obtained his initial fortune via piracy. Wallglass, an independent firm that is much respected in the intelligence community, is seeking evidence to validate this accusation.

Harlan Turk, Rackham's running mate in the election, has lobbied for Congress to halt the investigation. He asserted: « The Federal Times is breaching the impartiality rules of journalism, and violating the security measures afforded to all presidential candidates. »

Political ICE-caster Sura Oyekan also voiced her objections: « This is an outrageous attack on the reputation of a respected public figure, a great man who has contributed so much to Federal commerce and culture. »

There was a more speculative approach from independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse:

« Hiring the Wallglass Investigations Agency to dig up dirt on Zachary Rackham is a smart move, albeit an expensive one. They'll already have insights from their own detectives Gunnarson and Wolfe, who infiltrated the Jokers' Deck gambling circle and found Rackham was a member. Or was he really there to quietly fund the coup against Archon Delaine by two of his own arch-corsairs? I think we all know the answer. »

« Wallglass might also have access to the finance systems of Rackham Capital Investments, which were originally acquired by a hacktivist group known as the Collective. These nameless geniuses stole a billion credits \u2013 the same amount suspiciously won by Rackham in the Federal Grand Lottery \u2013 and distributed it to former employees whose pensions had been illegally withheld. Bravo! »

« The latest rumours are that Wallglass has tracked down fellow pirate Taja Gavaris, the ex-CFO who attempted a corporate takeover. Allegedly she fled Federal space after Rackham counter-blackmailed her, but if anyone knows where the bodies are buried, it's Gavaris. I'm expecting some juicy revelations soon. »


* Upgraded Xeno Scanner Requires Resources
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis aims to provide an update to the pulse wave xeno scanner that can locate captive humans on Thargoid Titans.

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Alliance's scientific liaison to Aegis, informed the media about the project:

« Information provided by Seo Jin-ae suggests that people abducted by the Thargoids are being kept alive aboard the Titan motherships inside 'pods'. This theory makes sense - since Thargoid atmospheres are toxic to humans, any captives are surely sealed in an environment that meets their respiratory and nutritional needs. »

« The pulse wave xeno scanner has been modified by Allied, Federal and Imperial technicians, working in concert using Aegis's communications protocols. The module's electromagnetic pulse technology aims to identify these pods by detecting several key markers generated by living humans. »

« A broader effort to prepare for humanitarian rescue efforts is underway, but we have encountered a shortage of neofabric insulation, polymers and thallium. Shipments of these materials are urgently required to support the crews onboard rescue megaships in its vital work. »

Contributors are asked to transport these commodities to Muller Terminal in the Rabh system. The CD-51 1447 Imperial Society has agreed to coordinate the enterprise on behalf of Aegis, and will protect deliveries by redeeming bounty vouchers for all wanted ships in the system.


* Rescue Megaships Scheduled to Redeploy
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The eleven megaships coordinating evacuation efforts from Thargoid-invaded systems are set to move over the next few weeks.

Military analysis of the current front line has highlighted that the distance between active conflict areas and the megaships can be decreased with an acceptably low degree of risk. Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson, part of the Imperial delegation to Aegis, offered this comment:

« Shortening the distance between systems which require humanitarian support and the megaships responsible for coordinating that support is important. Until now we have urged caution to maintain their current safe positions, since these vessels are obvious targets for Thargoid attack. But as our brave pilots continue to regain territory and push the alien forces back, we feel confident that this is the right decision. »

From September 7th, the following megaships will temporarily cease offering new mission contracts. They will redeploy to new locations on September 14th, with missions offered once again:

Rescue Ship Foerster

Rescue Ship Hutner

Rescue Ship Seacole

Rescue Ship Yoshida

Allied Solace

From September 14th, the following megaships will temporarily cease offering new mission contracts. They will redeploy to new locations on September 21st, with missions offered once again:

Rescue Ship Bertschinger

Rescue Ship Cavell

Rescue Ship Cornwallis

Rescue Ship Kisseih

Imperial Sanctum

Federal Haven

Any ships or modules stored on the rescue megaships will be transported safely to the new location.


* Sirius Corporation Discusses Thargoid Abductions
Sirius Corporation has revealed a long-running project to rescue people who were captured by the Thargoids.

CEO Li Yong-Rui made this statement during a press conference:

« Shortly after the early reports of Thargoid Interceptors collecting inhabited escape pods were received, Sirius has explored several possible countermeasures. Various remote recovery methods had been designed, although only a few prototypes were ever constructed. »

« Now that the Thargoids are conducting widespread, systematic abductions of living humans, we believe that this research may prove crucial to saving millions of lives. Sirius Corporation is willing to bypass the commercial potential of our work and share it directly with Aegis. I have personally requested a meeting with Professor Tesreau to provide details and discuss options. »

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, who oversees the Alliance's contributions to Aegis, was invited to comment by the Old Worlds Gazette:

« The Assembly has no knowledge of this project, since it falls outside of our strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation. My concern is whether this comes with an expectation of a reciprocal data exchange. Li Yong-Rui's offer sounds like an altruistic gesture, but sometimes the true price of information is unclear. I intend to discuss this with the other Aegis coordinators before any decisions are made. »

Aegis is currently gathering resources for an upgraded pulse wave xeno scanner, which can locate human captives held on Thargoid Titans. There has been speculation that Sirius Corporation's research may prove useful to the anticipated next step: rescuing those abductees from their confinement.


* Aegis Releases Upgraded Xeno Scanner
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A pulse wave xeno scanner upgrade that can detect human life signs on Thargoid Titans is now available.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, announced the campaign's successful conclusion:

« The upgraded pulse wave xeno scanner will isolate human life signs aboard the Titan motherships. If Seo Jin-ae is correct that some of our missing populations are being stored by the Thargoids, this could be the most important technological breakthrough in the war. I'm deeply grateful to all those who helped make it a reality. »

« Aegis is already trialling potential methods to rescue abductees, providing they can be located. I have also accepted Li Yong-Rui's invitation to discuss the recovery methods already explored by Sirius Corporation, following majority approval from our superpower delegates. »

Former Federal admiral and current Aegis military strategist Aden Tanner discussed the practicalities of locating human captives:

« I want to remind pilots of how dangerous this task will be. Ships must be equipped with caustic sink launchers to survive within the corrosive Maelstroms, as well as Thargoid pulse neutralisers to breach the Titan's defensive barrier.Flying close to the surface of the Titans is no easy feat, plus there is an ever-present risk of attack by patrolling Thargoid vessels. But I know how determined many of you are to find these poor souls. Every human identified is a potential life saved the moment we have the tools to do so. »

In advance of the pulse wave scanner upgrade, Aegis hosted a campaign in the Rabh system which aimed to resupply low-stock commodities for the broader humanitarian efforts. Independent pilots managed to deliver quantities of neofabric insulation, polymers and thallium. While the eventual total received was lower than anticipated, current stocks should now be sufficient while a permanent supply chain is established.

CD-51 1447 Imperial Society is now rewarding contributors to Aegis's initiative at Muller Terminal in the Rabh system. Pilots who protected deliveries by destroying wanted ships can also now redeem bounty vouchers.


* Wallglass Links Rackham to 'Calico Zack'
The Federal Times has published evidence that trillionaire and presidential candidate Zachary Rackham was once the pirate lord 'Calico Zack'.

The newsfeed featured a detailed expos\u00e9 by financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:

« The Wallglass Investigations Agency has confirmed my long-held suspicions about Zachary Rackham's past. With the timely assistance of independent pilots, we have unearthed a message archive concealed in the Zeta Trianguli Australis system. »

« This was created as insurance by a pirate named Angelo Defries. Wallglass's analysis revealed that Defries learned of Zachary Rackham's alter-ego over sixteen years ago, and threatened to transmit evidence to several newsfeeds \u2013 including, ironically, us here at The Federal Times. »

« While Defries seems to have disappeared around 3292 with his evidence withheld, conversations from that period were traced to the Wishbone Point facility. Wallglass, in conjunction with volunteer pilots, tracked down and decrypted the damning logs. »

« This vindicates my many years investigating Rackham's criminal activities and corruption. More importantly, we have proved that the Federation is at risk of electing a pirate lord as its president. »

Vox Galactica reporter Patricia Chen covered the story:

« Mr Rackham strenuously denied these allegations, stating that he always tolerated 'being associated with a mythical figure' as it gave him 'an aura of danger that was useful in boardroom meetings'. His devoted followers say that the evidence was manufactured for Wallglass to find, and that Bryanna Blanco is secretly funded by either Jerome Archer or Felicia Winters. »

« However, high-profile supporters such as business magnate 'Sir' Randolph Plaskett and ICE-caster Sura Oyekan  have publicly withdrawn their support. The value of shares in Rackham Capital Investments has also nosedived. With a month until the voting period opens, this discovery has disrupted an already much-delayed Federal election. »


* Rackham Withdraws from Presidential Election
Zachary Rackham has officially ended his election campaign, following the discovery of evidence that supported claims of his criminal past.

Federal Times journalist Bryanna Blanco published the results of an investigation by the Wallglass Investigations Agency, which included a message archive found on Zeta Trianguli Australis A 7 a. These findings strongly support a long-standing rumour that the trillionaire operated as notorious pirate lord 'Calico Zack', prior to inheriting his family's wealth.

PR consultant Anya Blackriver delivered a statement, in her role as campaign manager:

« Mr Rackham has decided that these attempts at defamation are a regrettable distraction from his election campaign. His amused tolerance of the nickname 'Calico Zack' \u2013 a nickname assigned to him by the media, I should point out \u2013 is not an admission of any true link to that despicable outlaw. Rather than allow the race for the Federal presidency to be clouded by these ridiculous claims, Mr Rackham's legal team has advised a focus on defending his good name away from the spotlight. »

This announcement came a day after Congressman Harlan Turk formally resigned from his role as Zachary Rackham's running mate. He will continue representing the Duamta system as an independent.

Federation correspondent Patricia Chen reported on the situation for Vox Galactica:

« There is speculation Rackham was warned that any further revelations could render him unelectable to the majority \u2013 and open to criminal charges. While the Federal Times piece is mostly based on circumstantial evidence at this stage, Rackham's willingness to concede his claim to the presidency suggests a nervousness towards deeper dives into his past. His business portfolio has also been severely damaged, causing billions of losses in share price. Investors and corporate partners are avoiding any association with the man who may once have been Calico Zack. »

« Both of his political rivals welcomed the news. 'Nobody with even a hint of criminality deserves a position of such significant power,' remarked former FIA director Jerome Archer, while Felicia Winters agreed it was best that Rackham 'stands aside to let the grown-ups do their work.' The electoral race is now evenly balanced between the two, with voting scheduled to take place in October. »


* Aegis Resolves to Free Abductees from Titans
With human life-signs now confirmed beneath the hulls of the Thargoid Titans, the urgency to mount a rescue mission has intensified.

Many pilots equipped with the updated pulse wave xeno scanner detected signals that match living humans on every Titan mothership. As a result, Aegis has prioritised finding a way to recover the abducted. A potential solution has emerged, reportedly via a low-ranking engineer within Sirius Corporation.

Director Ivano Colombera, the Empire's scientific liaison to Aegis, explained:

« Li Yong-Rui has shared Sirius Corporation's projects to counter Thargoid abductions, and this has accelerated our work. Among their research was a blueprint that repurposes sub-surface displacement missiles \u2013 a commonly used mining tool \u2013 to breach Thargoid vessels and expose captured escape pods. »

« These missiles were originally designed to extract mineral deposits from within asteroids without causing its destruction. Our consensus is that with some modifications, they could be deployed to target the human storage chambers within the Titan and retrieve the captives safely. »

Aden Tanner discussed the approach with cautious optimism:

« This could be the non-lethal rescue method we've been searching for. However, these missiles are intended for minerals not people, and Thargoid technology is poorly understood. We must ensure that we won't inadvertently harm those we're trying to save, and prevent an aggressive reaction from the Titans themselves if possible. »

Aegis confirmed that it has begun manufacturing prototype sub-surface missiles capable of penetrating the Titans' outer hulls. Further developments are expected to be announced shortly.


* Thargoid War Update: September 3309
The race is on to develop technology which can recover humans from Thargoid Titans, reports Vox Galactica journalist Jade Sanderlyn.

« Now we know the stomach-churning truth: the Thargoids are keeping people they abduct alive. The dramatic leak of a high-level conversation within Aegis confirmed that Thargoid tactics had shifted to incorporate the mass abduction of humans. Seo Jin-ae's telepathic connection to the aliens revealed that captives are being stored inside pod-like structures aboard the Titans. She also sensed that the Thargoids considered these captives an important part of their invasion plan. »

« Aegis took these visions seriously, releasing an update to the pulse wave xeno scanner that was designed to test her hypothesis. Sure enough, those pilots who dared make a close approach to the Thargoid motherships detected human life-signs beneath their hulls. This is where civilians from conquered systems are being held. For what purpose? We scarcely dare imagine. »

« Demands to save these people from their unknown fate have rippled across every inhabited world. To their credit, the three superpowers have empowered Aegis to make this its top priority. Even Sirius Corporation has offered assistance, sharing designs for a modified sub-surface displacement missile that might be capable of extracting these pods from within the Titans. Time is of the essence, since not even Seo Jin-ae knows for certain what the Thargoid intentions are for the prisoners. »

« From the scientific community to the general public, there is enormous speculation. What state will the captives be in, assuming they can be recovered alive? Will they even be recognisably human? Some xenologists claim that the life-support chambers \u2013 to protect humans from the Thargoids' toxic atmosphere \u2013 mean a stable physical condition is probably. But whether this is a necessity of their capture methods or an intentional step in a broader process remains unclear. »

« Meanwhile, anti-xeno forces continue to achieve impressive results. The number of Thargoid-controlled systems has reduced significantly from only three months ago. Alien fleets are apparently struggling to expand their territory, with organised system defences supported by the Pilots' Federation preventing the loss of new systems. What seemed like a near-hopeless task when the Maelstroms arrived has become a shining example of human courage and determination for future generations. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Deliver Resources for Extraction Missile Manufacture
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis has requested materials to construct sub-surface extraction missiles that recover imprisoned humans from the Titans.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, announced:

« Using blueprints provided by Sirius Corporation, engineering teams have worked around the clock to modify sub-surface displacement munitions. These adaptations enable the projectiles to breach sections of the Titans' hulls and jettison the bio-storage capsules embedded within. »

« We could spend the next few months in a testing cycle, and ideally that would be the case \u2013 but lives are at risk and we can't be sure how much time our missing have. Therefore, we have approved mass production of these sub-surface extraction missiles. Industrial materials are urgently needed to establish assembly centres, so that we can distribute them as rapidly as possible. »

Princess Aisling Duval, who is coordinating the Empire's involvement with Aegis, transmitted a personal message:

« My heart goes out to the families and friends of the millions unaccounted for following the Thargoid invasions. But I urge you all to hold onto the hope of seeing your loved ones again. With this breakthrough, we finally have a chance to rescue some of those poor souls. Nobody doubts that this will be dangerous, and yet if this war has proved anything, it's that we can rise to any challenge when we work together. »

Aegis has requested shipments of CMM composites, neofabric insulation and osmium, to be delivered to Springer Gateway in the Senlu system. To protect transports, bounty vouchers for all wanted ships in the system will be redeemed by the Green Party of Senlu.


* The Future of the Throne
The Imperial Senate has formally raised the issue that Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has not yet produced any direct heirs.

The debate was instigated by Senator Lysandra Courcelle :

« The continuation of the Duval bloodline has formed the linchpin of our society for over a thousand years. But it has been eight years since Arissa Lavigny-Duval became our ruler. In that time there has been no spouse or consort, no indications of marriage, and no biological heir to the throne. We politely remind the Emperor of her duty to ensure the line of succession. »

Following a highly spirited exchange among senators, Chancellor Anders Blaine proclaimed:

« Her Majesty has sacrificed much for the Empire. It is not our place to question her personal choices, but rather to support her vision for our prosperity and security. »

Gudrun Vestergaard, royal correspondent for The Imperial Herald, analysed the situation:

« This is a delicate subject, but one of enormous importance. The Imperial Mother's recent illness has brought into focus the passing of the torch through each generation of Duvals. Every Emperor of the last thousand years has had one or more children. The public has a certain expectation that an Emperor will produce healthy heirs to continue the Duval line, and each new birth is proudly celebrated across the Empire. »

« However, there has never been any indication that Arissa has a partner, or entertains marriage prospects of any kind. Princess Aisling Duval's romantic liaisons \u2013 including, famously, a Federal ambassador \u2013 took the media spotlight for years. Hadrian Duval is married with a baby son, and others such as Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval have multiple offspring. But Her Majesty seems content to rule alone. »

« Senator Courcelle has raised a valid question: how long can this continue? And if Arissa remains childless, who will be the next Emperor? »


* Celebrations in Sol for Federal Election
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A series of public events to celebrate the forthcoming presidential election are being held in the Sol system.

Congress approved a request by President Zachary Hudson to finance a range of festivities, concerts and shows across the home system of the Federation.

Billions of people are expected to attend, leading to a request for supplies of Crystalline Spheres, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Indi Bourbon, LTT Hyper Sweet and Pantaa Prayer Sticks to be delivered to Li Qing Jao starport in orbit over planet Earth. Congress also agreed to authorise a temporary two-week permit for all Pilots' Federation members to access the Sol system.

President Hudson announced the events across all Federal news channels, where he said:

« Now we approach the time, as determined centuries ago by the Federal Accord, of our civilisation's most profound tradition: the peaceful transfer of power. I have been deeply honoured to serve as your president for the past eight years. And you, the people of the galaxy's largest ever democracy, deserve to celebrate all that we have accomplished together. »

Vox Galactica's political journalist Conrad Sterling observed:

« This is clearly a high-profile attempt to boost public morale, one that allows President Hudson to leave office on a positive note. Political critics are viewing it as a way to distract the citizens from the prolonged Thargoid war, the recent Rackham scandal, and various other challenges besetting the Federation. But the eagerness of most citizens to embrace the sentiment proves one fact remains true: everyone loves a party. »

Voting will open next Thursday for Federal citizens to choose either Vice President Jerome Archer or Shadow President Felicia Winters as their next president. The election winner will be announced at the start of the following week.


* Aegis Produces Sub-Surface Extraction Missiles
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Rescue megaships now stock Aegis's modified mining tool, designed to extract bio-storage capsules from Thargoid Titans.

The sub-surface extraction missiles went into rapid production following a delivery initiative in the Senlu system. Aegis has confirmed that pilots who transported CMM composites, neofabric insulation and osmium to Springer Gateway can now collect their rewards. Bounty vouchers for all wanted ships destroyed during the past week will also be redeemed at the same location.

Aden Tanner discussed tactics for using the new module:

« These specialised devices are designed to be used alongside the pulse wave xeno scanner, which can now pinpoint human life signs beneath the hull of a Titan. If accurately targeted, an extraction missile should penetrate far enough into the outer hull to jettison the pod-like structures containing captives. Assuming the extraction is successful, these capsules can then be taken onboard via cargo scoop. »

« All pilots who achieve this should deliver recovered capsules to the nearest search and rescue contact. Aegis has provided instructions to medical and military teams standing by at these locations. These personnel will place capsules into high-security quarantine before attempting to revive the occupants. »

« Once again, I remind pilots to outfit their ships to deal with the Maelstroms' caustic effects, defensive barriers and Thargoid patrols. Deploying the extraction missiles might also trigger counterattacks from the Titans themselves. These are perhaps the most dangerous rescue missions ever attempted. But I am confident that we can bring many of our people home. »

The first wave of ships equipped with sub-surface extraction missiles are already making their initial forays into the Maelstroms.


* Scientists Study Thargoid Barnacle Matrix Sites
Aegis xenologists are focusing their efforts on the mysterious alien growths reported on multiple planets and moons in the Trianguli sector.

These have been designated 'Thargoid barnacle matrix sites', due to their resemblance to the barnacles that produce meta-alloys, but are far greater in size and complexity.

Commander Yoselin Aquino  described visiting one of these sites to Vox Galactica:

« This wasn't an easy place to explore, since I had to avoid Revenant drones and the occasional Thargoid scout. Once I did get up close, I found it unsettling as all hell. Each barnacle clump was a mound-like structure over a kilometre across, with several rounded peaks. Spaced around these were weird coral trees, which squeeze out a caustic sap-like stuff and dropped bizarre-looking 'fruits. »

« What really made me nervous were the spear roots in the middle of the site. They're made of some toughened substance in a sort of segmented spike, like gigantic skeletal fingers reaching up through the ground. If you ask me, these things are alive in some way. The noises my audio converter picked up made me feel like they were moving, closing around me to drag me down. »

Professor Shamus Madigan, Federal scientific liaison to Aegis, published a project update:

« Barnacle matrix sites emit a significant amount of electromagnetic interference which, coupled with aggressive Thargoid defenders, has prevented a detailed underground analysis. However, Aegis is now devoting extra resources to investigate why these organic structures exist. »

« I can report that geological sensors have detected vibrations resulting from sub-surface activity, with occasional quakes rippling across the ground. This suggests that violent chemical or physical processes are taking place internally. The prevailing theory is that these sites are still not completely formed, but we cannot yet determine their nature or purpose. »


* First Captives Freed from Thargoid Titans
The first humans rescued from the Thargoid motherships have started to arrive, almost all of whom have so far survived extraction.

The highly dangerous task requires using an upgraded pulse wave xeno scanner to detect human life signs on the Titans. The new sub-surface extraction missiles then target and jettison the bio-storage capsules \u2013 as the structures are officially designated \u2013 which are then recovered using a cargo scoop.

All recovered individuals are being assessed by medical specialists. The tri-superpower agency Aegis released this statement to the media:

« In each case, research teams successfully cracked open the capsules and removed the comatose person. They were suspended within a chemically complex gel, not unlike amniotic fluid, with tubes supplying breathable air and basic nutrients. Between thirty and ninety minutes later, the person wakes. »

« All recovered individuals are currently being kept in strict medical quarantine under military guard. Molecular scans are being conducted to ensure that no traces of Thargoid material remains, and a period of long-term observation now begins. »

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, was permitted to observe these procedures. As part of a report in The Empirical scientific journal, she noted:

« The former abductees I have seen looked physically healthy, and returned to consciousness easily. Most remembered little about their abduction, though several mentioned an overwhelming urge to 'escape their ship' prior to blacking out. Some described being semi-aware of their time in stasis, saying it felt 'like an extended dream'. Others were in a state of shock or showed signs of psychological trauma \u2013 understandably, considering the nightmarish circumstances. »

« The capsules are clearly designed to sustain oxygen-breathing life forms indefinitely, protected both from the vacuum of space and the Thargoids' ammonia-based environment. But what the aliens intended to use these people for remains unknown. »

Aegis later stated that identities are being logged and will soon be made public, with the hope that families and friends will be able to visit.


* Federal Election: The Imperial Perspective
As the Federation readies itself for a new president, the Empire is preparing for potential changes to its relationship with its historical rival.

Last year Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval severed all official collaboration with the other superpowers, except for limited contributions to Aegis. But this does not mean the Empire is ignoring the potential impact of either Jerome Archer or Felicia Winters becoming the next Federal president.

Senator Denton Patreus remarked on the election during a military parade through the city of Port Isabelle:

« The Federation's leaders always reinforce their popularity by framing the Empire as the 'great enemy'. I expect Archer will have those same aggressive tendencies. In truth, I'd prefer to deal with that predictable approach, since Winters is clearly the more cunning and deceitful candidate. »

Princess Aisling Duval was asked her opinion while visiting a xenology seminar hosted by the Achenar Research Council:

« I must admit that Felicia Winters's style of governance is more appealing, though she should be mindful of her running mate's influence. But whoever becomes president must break the cycle of hostility between Empire and Federation. My fruitful collaboration with other Aegis delegates, and ACT's success against the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, is evidence of how effective inter-superpower cooperation can be. »

The election was also discussed by Cassia Carvalho, political journalist for The Imperial Herald:

« The average Imperial citizen has little interest in the Federation's internal workings, but anxiety in the Senate is high. With the Thargoid war still raging, the prospect of a new president seeking to stamp their authority on the interstellar stage is a major concern. Conversely, some captains of industry anticipate a new era of trade with a friendlier Federation, if the Emperor can be convinced to rescind her isolationist decree. »

Voting within Federal systems has been running for 24 hours, and polling suggests Felicia Winters holds a slight lead over Jerome Archer. The election will run for another three days.


* Sol Celebrations End as Election Begins
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The Federation has begun voting to decide its next president, as a week of festivities in the Sol system are concluded.

Congress confirmed that any pilots who supplied rare goods for the celebratory events can collect payment from Li Qing Jao starport. All temporary system permits for Sol remain suspended for Pilots' Federation members for a further week.

The 3309 presidential election has now officially begun. More than one trillion Federal citizens    are expected to submit their votes, which will be recorded and collated over the next four days via secure digital systems.

Vice President Jerome Archer is the Republican Party candidate, who is widely perceived as the political heir to President Zachary Hudson. His running mate is Congressman Niko Shirakawa, who has strong connections within the military.

Shadow President Felicia Winters, leader of the Liberal Party, is the rival candidate and a proponent of more humanitarian-focused policies. She is on a presidential ticket with Congressman Isolde Rochester, matriarch of the famous Rochester dynasty.

Sofia Trevino, political correspondent for The Federal Times, commented:

« Following months of delay, logistical issues caused by the Thargoid war, plus the drama surrounding Zachary Rackham, voting is finally underway. Analysts believe this could be one of the closest-run elections in the Federation's history, reflecting the polarisation that has taken place in recent years. »

« Support for the Republican Party has been bolstered by its increasingly successful handling of the Thargoid menace during the past six months. But Archer's flagship creation, the Proactive Detection Bureau, remains highly divisive \u2013 something the Liberal Party has found success in using to frame its opponent as increasingly authoritarian. How these primary points will ultimately impact the outcome of the vote remains to be seen. »

The new president will be announced on Monday 16th October. President Hudson will remain in office as caretaker president until the official inauguration of the election winner, expected to take place in the new year.


* Federal Election: The Allied Perspective
The Alliance is observing the Federal president election, but expects little will change in relationships between the two superpowers.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon delivered a formal address on the topic before the Assembly:

« The Alliance continues to enjoy stable relations with the Federation. Our recent anti-xeno coalitions, including the reformation of Aegis, show how we can benefit from maintaining such cooperation. I am confident that the new president, whoever it may be, will respect the status quo. »

Councillor Nakato Kaine gave a more direct statement to the press:

« I cannot ignore how the Federation has become more authoritarian under Zachary Hudson's Republican government. It has also coped poorly with internal pressures: the Starship One conspiracy, Jupiter Division's attempted coup, the secession crisis triggered by the Proactive Detection Bureau's operation\u2026 the list goes on. And yet, Federal democracy is now empowering every individual to elect their leaders. That, at least, is something we in the Alliance should admire and consider adopting. »

Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported:

« Most Allied politicians are too diplomatic to openly express a preference between the two candidates. Privately, councillors like Kaine are hopeful of a more nuanced relationship with Winters, who lacks the hawkish rhetoric of Hudson. However, others believe that Archer's focus on military spending and domestic security might prove more practical in the face of the Thargoid invasion. »

The latest voting polls from Federal systems show that Jerome Archer has overtaken Felicia Winters, albeit by a narrow margin. The voting window ends on the 15th, with the results verified by Monday to determine the victor of the 3309 Federal presidential election.


* Felicia Winters Elected as Federal President
The Federation has voted to elect Felicia Winters as its next president, with a four per cent vote majority over her rival Jerome Archer.

The current shadow president of the Liberal Party will be officially inaugurated in the new year, entering an eight-year term of office. Congressman Isolde Rochester will also be sworn in as vice president in Winters's administration.

President Zachary Hudson will remain in power during the transition period, but will not be expected to implement any major policy changes. The Liberal Party will replace the Republican Party as the superpower's governing authority in 3310, with Jerome Archer assuming the role of shadow president.

President-elect Winters addressed her supporters during a celebratory rally in Olympus Village on Mars:

« The people of the Federation have spoken! I thank you all for turning my party's vision into a reality. My aim is to govern fairly for everybody, regardless of their political allegiance. Together we will create optimism where there was fear, give shelter those who are vulnerable, and improve the quality of life for each and every Federal citizen. »

Vice President Jerome Archer formally conceded the election during a session of Congress:

« My compliments to Felicia Winters, who fought a strong campaign. I look forward to taking on the role of shadow president next year, and ensuring that her government's proposals are thoroughly scrutinised from day one. »

Former presidents Antonia Madison and Jasmina Halsey \u2013 whom Winters temporarily replaced after the Starship One disaster \u2013 offered their congratulations. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon of the Alliance, First Minister Octavia Volkov of the Marlinist Colonies, and CEO Li Yong-Rui of Sirius Corporation sent similar messages to the Winters campaign.

No formal acknowledgement was received from the Empire. However, Princess Aisling Duval joined Professor Alba Tesreau and other members of Aegis leadership to state: « We trust that President Winters will remain committed to our unified approach, ensuring the development of technology needed to secure victory in the ongoing Thargoid war. »


* Winters Outlines Her Future Presidency
President-elect Felicia Winters has discussed her election victory and other topics during an interview with The Federal Times.

On defeating Vice President Jerome Archer:

« One cannot dispute that Archer played his campaign straight, with none of the underhanded tricks utilised by some of his predecessors. But the election results prove that the citizens want a change from the Republican Party's bombastic approach. »

On the priorities for her forthcoming administration:

« Our government will expand investment in the Federation's soft infrastructure, pulling the economy's focus away from military projects and corporate profits. Many systems are in dire need of improved healthcare, housing and work opportunities. Billions of people need temporary financial support as refugees from the Thargoid invasion. We are not the Empire \u2013 we serve our people rather than rule over them. »

On the Proactive Detection Bureau:

« My very first task in office will be to dismantle this monstrosity, ending the surveillance of private communications. The Federal Intelligence Agency is perfectly capable of protecting our people without violating their personal freedoms. »

On the Thargoid war:

« I can assure everyone that while I lack the enthusiasm for war that my predecessor demonstrated, my administration takes office with the Thargoid invasion as a top priority. Aegis has led the way in developing new anti-xeno technologies, and Federal support for the agency will continue. »

Many Federal newsfeeds congratulated Felicia Winters on her success in the election, but an editorial in Sol Today said:

« Without Zachary Hudson's strength of will, or Jerome Archer's dedication to security, there's every possibility that the Federation will rot from within. You can expect to see all manner of fringe groups and minorities grab the lion's share of funding, while freeloaders and criminals get a free pass. We predict that Winters will go down in history as one of the weakest presidents ever. »


* Titan Survivors Kept in Quarantine
Thousands of people rescued from captivity within the Thargoid motherships remain isolated under strict medical and security protocols.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, spoke at a press conference:

« I'm relieved to see that the sub-surface extraction missiles are proving effective, especially considering how quickly they went into production. Many pilots are using them to excavate bio-storage capsules from beneath the hulls of the Thargoid Titans. »

« Each resuscitated individual has undergone an exhaustive range of physical scans and psychological evaluations. Some are being treated for stress-related conditions and mental trauma, but otherwise they appear to be unharmed. With no clear evidence that these people have been infected or influenced by the Thargoids in some manner, Aegis has sent a number of proposals to superpower governments as they consider the next steps. »

Despite this announcement, everyone extracted from a bio-storage capsule remains under military quarantine. The Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent factions have all instructed that any citizen who was abducted by Thargoids must be kept in high-security isolation until further notice.

As discussed by reporter Ernesto Rios for Vox Galactica:

« There is widespread concern that whatever the Thargoids had planned for their human captives was set in motion before rescue efforts began. While scientific analysis of the captives disputes this notion \u2013 as all results have thus far \u2013 the returnees may face prejudice and mistrust when they are permitted to rejoin society. »

In related news, there are reports that the Thargoid barnacle matrix sites have recently undergone enormous growth, with sightings of 'towering spires' and similar megastructures. Aegis and other scientific bodies have sent analysis teams to all known sites to gather data.


* Mysterious Phenomenon Triggers Violent Attacks
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A large naval squadron has gone rogue in the Shamash system, amid claims of widespread mental instability caused by an unknown signal.

Security forces for the Shamash Future faction were practising fleet manoeuvres, shortly before they turned their weapons against passing traffic. Lieutenant Commander Mackenzie Coates , one of the officers coordinating Fleet Exercise Grey Swan, told the media:

« All crews deployed for the exercise are now ignoring orders and attacking anything within range. The evidence we've gathered suggests they're suffering from violent mania, caused by some kind of mass psychological disturbance. They are still capable of operating the ships, making them a danger to civilians. »

« Garrett Orbital outpost reported an anomalous multi-frequency signal during Grey Swan, which also broke through our primary comms network. We think it's related to the violence Shamash is now facing, but with all the chaos we haven't had a chance to investigate further. Garrett Orbital is now in lockdown, while security teams onboard try to contain outbreaks of aggression from affected personnel. »

A popular news program, 'Frameshift Live', was broadcasting from Garrett Orbital around the time of the fleet exercise. Disturbing footage indicates the presenters were similarly affected by this unexplained hysteria.

The San Tu State Network megaship Khonsu Gleam, present in Shamash on unrelated business, has been asked to host defensive efforts since the system lacks a starport. Captain Ulrich Maurer  has agreed to remain and support Shamash Future, by organising countermeasures against the Grey Swan fleet.

Speculation have been raised that the 'anomalous multi-frequency signal' might be a new Thargoid weapon, or a test of experimental mind-affecting technology. However, no alien or unauthorised vessels have been detected in the system, and the signal's origin remains unconfirmed.


* Eliminate Threat of Grey Swan Fleet
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Commanders have been asked to help destroy the rogue Grey Swan pilots killing civilians in the Shamash system.

Military squadrons taking part in Fleet Exercise Grey Swan became irrationally violent following an unexplained mass hysteria that swept through Garrett Orbital during a fleet training exercise. Captain Ulrich Maurer, commanding officer of the San Tu State Network megaship Khonsu Gleam, broadcast the following message:

« Shamash Future's security forces have asked us to help stop the carnage taking place throughout this system. No medical or technological solution has been found for affected pilots, who seem reluctant to leave Shamash. Therefore, to prevent the loss of more innocent lives, there is regrettably no choice but to eliminate every ship in the Grey Swan fleet. »

« We are urgently seeking to recruit independent pilots with combat experience. Financial rewards and other incentives will be available at the Khonsu Gleam. Hopefully we can perform this unpleasant task as efficiently as possible. »

Wing Commander Mackenzie Coates was coordinating Fleet Exercise Grey Swan when a bizarre signal caused its crews to become homicidal. She told a local newsfeed:

« This is a nightmarish situation. I'm trained to deal with pirates, invaders and even Thargoids, not to hunt down my own friends and colleagues. The thought of them being turned into deranged savages\u2026 I know they wouldn't want to live like that. But I can't be the one to pull the trigger \u2013 there are survivors on Garrett Orbital who need my help. »

Participants are advised that the Khonsu Gleam aims to complete the combat operation by Wednesday 1st November.


* Thargoid War Update: October 3309
Vox Galactica's Jade Sanderlyn discusses the successful recovery of people from the Titans and developments at the new Thargoid spire sites.

« When Aegis announced its plans to free abductees from the Thargoid motherships, I wasn't the only one expecting the worst outcome. Turning a core mining missile into a way to extract life-support capsules from the Titans sounded extremely risky. And even if it worked, what state would these poor people be in after such a horrific experience? »

« Much to my relief, the scheme is working. Many thousands have now been brought back to civilisation, and seem to have suffered few ill-effects. Wisely, all are being kept under strict quarantine while a battery of medical tests are run on them. But I understand that, in most cases, abductees are permitted to communicate with their friends and families - most of whom never expected to hear from them again. »

« Another surprise, albeit much less welcome, were the rapid changes observed at the Thargoid barnacle matrix sites. Intense geological activity had been registered beneath the surface, but the alien growths resisted detailed analysis. Their transformation into colossal towers several kilometres high has startled the scientific community. »

« Xenologists tell me that the emergence of these Thargoid spire sites, as they're now classified, suggest that the aliens are putting long-term plans into place. Their actual purpose is unclear, but few believe that the outcome will be beneficial for humanity. »

« Elsewhere, resistance to the aliens remains as dedicated as ever. At the time of writing, no new invasions have been reported, and the Thargoids occupy only a third of the territory previously conquered by their fleets. Scores of once-inhabited systems still need to be liberated, but the mood among anti-xeno forces is that the tide has turned in humanity's favour. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Aegis Prioritises Research into Thargoid Spire Sites
The rapid evolution of Thargoid barnacle matrix sites into colossal spires has sparked intense scientific scrutiny and concern as to their purpose.

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Allied scientific liaison to Aegis, discussed recent developments in an article for The Empirical:

« There's no doubt that these twisting, biomechanical towers are important to the Thargoids. Each site is defended by highly aggressive drones, including a new type designated the 'Banshee'. Larger Thargoid vessels also routinely come and go, in a manner similar to ships docking with an outpost. »

« Some believe that each site is an alien city \u2013 a xenopolis, if you will \u2013 and that this marks the start of a colonisation programme. But I believe the Thargoids remain on a war footing. Either way, we are bringing together our finest xenologists to decipher their function as rapidly as possible. »

One of these scientists is Professor Ishmael Palin, who is recognised as a leading authority on the Thargoids. In a brief interview for Vox Galactica, he said:

« The construction of permanent surface structures confirms that the Thargoids have long-term plans. I've studied scans that indicate organic and mechanical processes taking place within each spire. My guess is they're industrial in nature, the equivalent of our extraction factories. It's possible they are producing or refining vast quantities of mineral substances to supply the Thargoid war machine. »

« Many pilots have already seen fit to provide me with compounds extracted from Thargoid spire sites, which has given my research an initial boost. Further samples can be delivered to Abel Laboratory or the bartender at Baird Gateway in the Arque system. »


* Grey Swan Fleet Destroyed in Shamash
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Crazed pilots that were killing civilians in the Shamash system have been eliminated.

The local security force vessels participating in Fleet Exercise Grey Swan were exposed to an anomalous signal, which then circulated through the fleet's networked comms. This apparently triggered a violent mania that caused them to attack passing traffic.

Captain Ulrich Maurer of the megaship Khonsu Gleam announced that an operation to eliminate the threat had concluded:

« All Grey Swan ships have now been targeted and destroyed. Though tragic, this action undoubtedly saved many thousands of lives and has brought peace to the system once more. San Tu State Network, in agreement with Shamash Future, has agreed to reimburse all independent pilots who took part. Payments are available for collection at the Khonsu Gleam. »

Shamash Future confirmed that Garrett Orbital, which was locked down due to several of its crew becoming homicidal, is now functioning as normal. The scars of the survivors may take much longer to resolve, however.

Research has begun into the cause of this event, although few details of note has been identified. One possible explanation was floated by Jaya Chaudhary, host of historical ICE-cast Ghastly Pasts:

« The horror which unfolded in Shamash bears strong similarities to the fate of the generation ship Thetis. This vessel from the 22nd century was discovered in the Nefertem system in 3303. Logs describe how its entire population turned on each other in a murderous rage, after a signal was picked up while passing an unnamed planet. This 'whispering' sound compelled everyone who heard it to kill on sight. »

« The Thetis phenomenon had never been encountered before or since \u2013 until now. What was once a chilling tale from the pages of history has become a sickening reality. We do not know where the signal was transmitted, how it interacts with the human mind or whether we'll encounter it again. These questions are attractive to researchers, but uncovering any answers may prove highly dangerous. »


* Thargoid Abductees Reconnect with Society
People who have been rescued from Thargoid Titans remain in quarantine, but can soon expect family visits and access to comms networks.

Aegis reported that bio-storage capsules are still being successfully extracted from the Thargoid motherships, albeit at high risk to pilots. Each revived individual has been placed in medical isolation, as per guidance from Aegis specialists.

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, who coordinates the Alliance's involvement with Aegis, discussed the situation in a session of the Assembly:

« All abductees are being monitored for signs of Thargoid physical or mental influence. So far, I'm pleased to say, these test results remain negative. Therefore, those from Allied systems are now permitted to receive visitors, while remaining under strict quarantine conditions. They are also being granted direct access to comms and public media. I understand that Federal, Imperial and most independent authorities will shortly follow suit with their own citizens. »

Director Nassim Qadir, head of medical research at Azimuth Biotech, was quoted in a formal statement from the corporation:

« Isolating all the returnees was prudent, but they should not be treated like normal people. The Thargoids went to great lengths to capture living humans, and we have not yet determined the reason. It's possible they are acting as carriers of an alien pathogen, or affected in some other way that Aegis's inferior procedures cannot detect. »

« We propose that Azimuth Biotech takes exclusive control of processing all those recovered from the Titans. We have the techniques, equipment and experience in researching human-xeno interactions. Only after being subjected to an intensive battery of examinations should these subjects have their civil rights and freedoms returned. »


* Hudson Lays Groundwork for Political Successors
President Zachary Hudson has announced a raft of legislation he intends to push during his last few months in office.

Political journalists have noted that many of the points would benefit the Republican Party while in opposition to the president-elect Felicia Winters administration. A press release from the Office of the Federal President listed the key initiatives currently underway:

« First: A new media standards agency will be established to regulate independently operated newsfeeds in Federal systems, to ensure local issues are presented in a format which adheres to Federal values. »

« Second: Corporations that have exclusive contracts with the Federal government will be granted significant tax rebates, on President Hudson's executive authority. »

« Third: The Federal Navy Intelligence Office will establish a data-sharing strategy with the Proactive Detection Bureau. This will broaden the net to capture even more criminal activity. »

« Fourth: Funding will be granted for a political think tank. This will be a cross-party institute to gather ideas, strategies and research that benefits the entire Federation. »

An editorial in the Federal Free Press pointed out the potential downsides to each of these initiatives:

« First: Sol Today's CEO Neive McFarlane is on the board of this 'independent' regulator, thereby ensuring local newsfeeds will have a pro-Republican voice at the highest level of oversight. »

« Second: Felicia Winters's administration will be forced to reverse these rebates to cover the loss of tax-generated revenue, which is guaranteed to cause friction with those corporations. »

« Third: The Federal Navy could provide military-grade technology for public surveillance, to bypass legal encryption software used to protect private conversations. It is likely Winters will be furious about this proposal, given her election pledge to dismantle the PDB entirely. »

« Fourth: Outgoing Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has volunteered to act as this think tank's congressional liaison \u2013 and assume the authority to decide which of its reports reach those in power. »


* Palin Makes Thargoid Spire Breakthrough
Analysis of objects and refinery compounds obtained from Thargoid spire sites has revealed a crucial connection to the Titans.

The announcement was made by Professor Ishmael Palin, who has been receiving deliveries of these materials from Pilots' Federation members:

« Genetic commonalities between the spire compounds and Titan hull fragments have now been verified. My research suggests these surface sites have been established to harvest resources which sustain the Thargoid motherships in some way. It may be that their supplies of some vital enzymes or fuels are running low, after months of being deployed away from their home worlds. »

« To capitalise on this newfound understanding, my team has synthesised a biological contaminant based on the chemical composition of the samples. Introducing this to a spire's processing chain can only help our efforts to disrupt their invasion plans. »

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Alliance's scientific liaison to Aegis, commented:

« It is important to note that Professor Palin's work is still in the experimental phase, necessitating further testing. Large quantities of the contaminant will need to be transported to all known spires. This will be a highly dangerous mission, as the sites are aggressively patrolled by Thargoid drones and vessels. »

Aegis has expressed gratitude to everyone who provided samples from the Titans and Thargoid spire sites to Professor Palin in the Arque system. A special notice was published honouring those pilots who delivered the first and the highest number of items:

* Winters Resists Hudson's Legacy Projects
President-elect Felicia Winters has vowed to defeat new legislation proposed by outgoing President Zachary Hudson.

If funded, these initiatives will establish a media standards regulator, set up a political think tank, and merge the Proactive Detection Bureau into the Federal Navy Intelligence Office. Tax rebates will also be granted to all corporations with existing government contracts.

The Federal Times approached Felicia Winters for comment:

« It's obvious that these pro-Republican measures are being pushed through because of Jerome Archer's poor electoral performance. It would look bad for Hudson to admit that his own vice president wasn't a popular choice of successor. So now he's giving Archer as many advantages as possible for when he becomes shadow president. »

« We aim to block these legislative changes should they go through Congress. And I personally guarantee that once I am in office, the PDB will no longer eavesdrop on every citizen's private communications. That's more than just an election pledge \u2013 it's about doing what is right. »

The newsfeed also published a statement by Owen McKenna, CEO of Core Dynamics:

« Winters says that she plans to cut back on military spending. That makes no sense during wartime, but as president it'll be her call. So, if you ask me, Hudson's corporate tax rebates should be allowed to stand. Then at least companies who supply the Federal Navy might have a chance of remaining profitable. »


* Concerns Raised over Titan Returnees
People who were recovered from the Thargoids have been flagged as potential biohazards by an Imperial medical institute.

Dr Zoe Terentia , chief researcher at Kamadhenu Medipure , published her findings in the Citizens Chronicle.

« Our analysis of abducted Imperial citizens currently in isolation has yielded disturbing results. There is clear evidence of an auto-immune response in multiple subjects. These manifest as minor physiological changes at a superficial level, which are mostly being dismissed. »

« In my professional opinion, this qualifies as evidence that these individuals have been altered in some way by the Thargoid-constructed bio-storage capsules. I recommend they all be relocated to a high-security location beyond inhabited space. Should further mutations manifest, euthanasia should be considered to prevent any chance of contamination. »

Director Ivano Colombera of the Imperial Science Academy, who acts as the Empire's scientific liaison to Aegis, opposed this assessment:

« The life support systems in Thargoid bio-storage capsules were intrusive, and in some cases left residual scarring. We would expect human physiology to react negatively to such an invasive artificial environment, and these natural immunological responses hardly qualify as 'mutations'. So we should not consider this a cause for alarm. Nevertheless, I agree that all returnees must stay quarantined until all necessary scientific observations are complete. »

The Imperial Herald featured related comments from Senator Caspian Leopold, another member of the delegation to Aegis:

« I concur with Director Colombera that caution must be our watchword. I'm told that those rescued from the Titans are being made as comfortable as possible, but for now they must remain isolated. I know that our stoic citizens will understand their duty. »

« Regarding this topic, Azimuth Biotech's offer to perform scientific tests on returnees has been formally rejected by the Senate. They decided that further association with Azimuth would not be of benefit to the Empire. And speaking personally, I will not countenance letting those butchers anywhere near our people. »


* Torval Mining Campaign Marks Ownership Change
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

A mining initiative is being held in the LHS 3872 system, as Torval Mining Ltd welcomes its new CEO.

Senator Zemina Torval, owner of the Imperial company until recently, has formally transferred her controlling shares to her eldest daughter. Constantia Torval was already director of operations, but will now oversee all corporate decision making from the highest chair.

From the press suite on Curbeam Hub starport, Ms Torval gave an announcement from the megaship Zetian's Recall:

« My mother's tireless efforts to build a corporation worthy of our family name have brought enormous success and esteem to the Torval portfolio. It is my honour to continue supplying vital resources to the great industries that drive our Empire. »

« To mark the occasion, Torval Mining Ltd offers generous payments for newly mined quantities of lithium hydroxide, painite, praseodymium and tritium. The campaign is being managed by the Aristocrats of Cuacocha, who will receive shipments at Curbeam Hub in LHS 3872. This follows my new policy to subcontract mining operations to other Imperial factions, in order to meet expanded resource extraction quotas. »

« A Torval Mining Ltd mining laser will also be awarded to those pilots who make a concerted effort to support our endeavours. »

Anton Lagorio, business correspondent for The Imperial Herald, reported:

« This announcement confirms rumours that Constantia Torval had been allowed to take the reins in managing the family company. Under her guidance, Torval Mining Ltd has expanded its sphere of operations and obtained many lucrative new contracts. Whereas Zemina Torval's policy was to manage as much as possible in-house, her daughter seems keen to build corporate relationships with subsidiaries within the Empire. »


* Alliance Reviews Sirius Defence Pact
The Alliance Assembly has approved a formal evaluation of its strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation.

The vote to launch an independent inquiry was led by Councillor Nakato Kaine, who summarised:

« This partnership has been in effect for nearly two years. What tangible military support have we seen? Sirius Corporation has done little to protect Allied populations from attack or abduction. The capital ships promised to the Alliance Defence Force remain on the drawing board. The Sirius Navy isn't even engaging the Thargoid fleets on the front line of this war. How much longer must we endure Li Yong-Rui's empty promises? »

Admiral Nikolas Glass, the megacorp's representative on the Council of Admirals, disputed these claims:

« In truth, an enormous amount of work is taking place behind the scenes. Sirius technicians have retrofitted many ageing ADF ships with modern weaponry and internal systems. We've invested significantly in new AX modules, such as the anti-xeno missile rack and pre-engineered heatsink. And our blueprints formed the basis for Aegis's sub-surface extraction missile, which has helped rescue so many from the Titans. »

An editorial piece in the Old Worlds Gazette speculated:

« The strategic defence pact has led to some successes, such as the Operation Tyndareus taskforce that repulsed a Thargoid incursion in Allied territory. But that was over a year ago, and the vision of a Sirius-backed Alliance Navy to rival the Empire or Federation has not materialised. »

« As displeasure grows in the Assembly, the option to renegotiate the pact has been raised alongside Councillor Kaine's proposal to terminate it entirely. Prime Minister Mahon faces political pressure to abandon his commitment to Sirius Corporation, especially now that a reformed Aegis is leading anti-xeno technology development. »


* Mining Campaign in LHS 3872 Concludes
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Torval Mining Ltd has announced that sufficient quantities of mined resources were delivered to its subsidiary faction.

The Aristocrats of Cuacocha, who control the LHS 3872 system, received the shipments of mined lithium hydroxide, painite, praseodymium and tritium. They have confirmed that all participating pilots can now collect their rewards at Curbeam Hub.

Constantia Torval, the corporation's recently appointed CEO, gave a statement:

« With this successful event, Torval Mining Ltd advances toward even greater prestige and profitability. I offer sincere thanks to our partners and contributors. »

The campaign's background was discussed by Gwendolyn Nash, Empire correspondent for Vox Galactica:

« Senator Zemina Torval handing Torval Mining Ltd to her oldest daughter is the latest of several curious developments in recent years. She established the company by branching out from Mastopolos Mining, severing connections with more distant family members. She also transferred many investments to her other daughter Petra Torval, who is also a senator, and grandson Titus Torval, an Imperial Intelligence captain. »

« Coupled with the fact that she has missed several Senate meetings recently, speculation is rife that the 132-year-old has entered the twilight of her corporate and political careers. But as even her sternest opponents would attest, it is never wise to underestimate Zemina Torval's willpower. »


* Azimuth Biotech: 'We Can Serve Alliance'
Azimuth Biotech has suggested that it can replace Sirius Corporation as the Alliance's anti-xeno military partner.

The move follows the Alliance Assembly's decision to reevaluate its strategic xeno defence pact with Sirius, amid concerns that the megacorp has not sufficiently protected Allied systems from the Thargoids.

CEO Torben Rademaker offered the following statement during a recent shareholder presentation:

« Azimuth Biotech is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 the only corporation to specialise in anti-xeno weapons tech. Sirius Corporation, once the trend-setter in so many fields, has become complacent and is now best described as a household goods manufacturer with delusions of grandeur. Aegis is a loosely connected gang of publicity-seekers playing war games with technology developed by uncredited researchers. But Azimuth specialists have been diligently researching the Thargoid species ever since we made first contact with them two centuries ago. »

« We can supply the Alliance Defence Force with weaponry and defensive technology guaranteed to be a match for anything in the Thargoids' arsenal. I'm prepared to meet with Prime Minister Mahon personally to work out the details of our proposal. »

The Alliance Assembly has not yet formally responded, but Councillor Hildegard Dressler said: « Our vulnerability to Thargoid attacks means Azimuth should be seriously considered to reinforce our security. » Councillor Ainsley Niven took the opposite view: « There will be mass uprisings if we collaborate with the most notoriously immoral company in history, one soaked in the blood that Salvation spilled in his pursuit of greatness. »

Leon Banerjee, science correspondent for Vox Galactica, observed:

« It's worth noting what Azimuth is not offering the Alliance: the anti-xeno superweapons that once cleared entire systems of Thargoids. Resurrecting Proteus Wave technology after HIP 22460 would cause a public outcry, but that wouldn't greatly concern Rademaker. Therefore, we can deduce that Azimuth's ability to weaponise Guardian artefacts died along with Salvation, leaving the corporation struggling for relevancy following his death. »


* Thargoid War Update: November 3309
Renowned war correspondent Jade Sanderlyn provides her regular summary of the latest news regarding the Thargoid conflict.

« It is now a whole year since the Thargoid Titans arrived and unleashed their fleets upon us. It's pleasing to report that humanity's resistance remains strong. New invasions are rare, and Thargoid vessels are being driven out of occupied systems. Nobody is under any illusions that this war might end soon, and it remains to be seen how the Thargoids adapt to the current situation. But among independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons, morale is high \u2013 as it absolutely deserves to be. »

« The Thargoid spire sites have also brought cause for cautious optimism. Having received huge volumes of samples for testing, Ishmael Palin proved that spire compounds and Titan hull fragments share genetic commonalities. Whatever these eerie alien growths are, evidence is growing that their industrial processes are related to the Thargoid motherships in some way. »

« Professor Palin has now concocted a biological impurity, which should disrupt the spires' biochemistry when inserted into their processing chain. Many pilots are signing up to undertake missions to deliver this contaminant, despite the inevitability that some volunteers will not return. It's too soon to determine whether or not this will impact the Thargoid war machine, but hopes are high. »

« Meanwhile, the many thousands of people rescued from captivity within the Titans remain in strict quarantine. Debate continues over how quickly they should be returned to society, but so far nobody seems to be taking any chances. »

« That could change following Felicia Winters' victory in the Federal presidential election. Via my political colleagues, I've heard that the president-elect plans to send home all returnees with Federation citizenship when her term of office begins next year. So we might soon score the greatest of victories: allowing those who were so cruelly abducted to return to their normal lives. »

« This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Kaine Launches Alliance Resource Drive
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Councillor Nakato Kaine has requested deliveries to the Tionisla system in protest against the anti-xeno defence pact.

Pilots are asked to deliver shipments of hazardous environment suits, micro controllers and titanium to Brett High. The Alliance Rapid-reaction Corps, which is hosting the initiative, will protect participants by redeeming bounty vouchers for the destruction of any wanted ships.

The campaign was personally arranged by Councillor Nakato Kaine, the representative for Tionisla in the Alliance Assembly. Speaking to the Old Worlds Gazette, Kaine stated:

« I aim to prove that the Alliance's military fleet is not as dependent upon Sirius Corporation as many believe. This campaign demonstrates our capability to stockpile vital resources for the Alliance Defence Force. And we have plenty of researchers, mechanics and manufacturers ready to develop our own defences against the Thargoids. »

« It's clear to me that Li Yong-Rui never intended to honour his anti-xeno commitments. I've seen evidence of Sirius negotiating favourable contracts with Allied tech and military corporations. Their special access to the Alliance's markets, plus the endorsement of our prime minister, have provided them with unfair leverage. The true cost of the pact has yet to be revealed, but you can bet that Allied citizens will pay the price while Sirius's profits soar. »

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has not commented on the Tionisla campaign, other than to confirm: « A formal inquiry into the strategic defence pact is ongoing, and the Assembly will study its findings carefully. »


* Titan Taranis Surrounded
The star system Hyades Sector FB-N B7-6, which contains Thargoid Titan Taranis, has been surrounded by human forces.

Aden Tanner, special advisor to Aegis, provided the following update:

« Our pilots appear to have pushed Thargoids out of all systems in Titan Taranis's area of control. It's taken a huge effort, one which should rightly be recognised as outstanding.  We don't know for certain what will happen next. But for now, the region is back in humanity's control. »

« I strongly urge pilots to keep fighting the Thargoid fleet wherever it is encountered. We must not become complacent - the Thargoids have surprised us before, and have demonstrated the ability to respond when defeat seems inevitable. Those who fought in the HIP 22460 campaign and witnessed the Proteus Wave event will testify to the dangers of assuming the war is won. »

Systems in the immediate vicinity, such as Hupang, Swahku and HR1737, have initiated repairs to starports which have been abandoned since November 3308. Titan Taranis itself remains largely resistant to conventional assault, and Hyades Sector FB-N B7-6 is still considered a Thargoid stronghold.


* Archer Outlines Shadow Presidency Future
Vice President Jerome Archer has discussed the recent Federal presidential election and other topics during an interview with The Federal Times.

On the victory of President-elect Felicia Winters:

« Winters fought a clean campaign based on issues, as I did, so one cannot fault her for that. But I think the harsh realities of governance will quickly overwhelm her liberal idealism. Hudson, whatever his critics may think of him, was never afraid to take decisive action. We'll see if Winters can do the same. »

On Archer's electoral policies:

« I maintain that a security-first approach is the correct one, given the many threats facing the Federation. The Thargoids are not the only enemy of our people. Dismantling the Proactive Detection Bureau, as Winters has threatened to do, will be an act of self-sabotage for our entire society. »

On his relationship with outgoing President Zachary Hudson:

« It's been an honour to support President Hudson, from whom I have learned a great deal about the political arena. Both of us are genuine patriots with similar viewpoints. I know he will continue to serve the Federation in his own way. »

On his future political career:

« As shadow president, it will be my duty to not only scrutinise Winters's administration, but also restore electoral faith in the Republican Party. I'm confident that the citizens will be fully on board with our policies by the next election, if not sooner. »

In response to this interview, an editorial in the Federal Free Press said:

« Jerome Archer's priority now is to gather Hudson loyalists under his banner, and position himself as a worthy successor. But this tactic of talking about all subjects except his own lack of responsibility for the election loss will not fool voters. Once the PDB is gone, and we see the improvements wrought by a Liberal Party administration, Archer faces a considerable challenge to avoid becoming a footnote in the Federation's history. »


* Spire Shutdown Confirms Thargoid Vulnerability
Professor Palin's biological impurity has proved effective against the Thargoid spire sites, and is capable of halting their functionality.

Independent war reporter Gus LaChappelle  published an on-the-scene report of the site in the Hyades Sector ST-Q B5-5 system for his ICE-cast channel Muzzle Flash:

« The eerie stillness surrounding me now is even more unnerving than when I visited this horror factory before. Bioluminescent nodules no longer pulse their sickly glow. Spires blot out the stars above, twisted towers made from solid night. Mega barnacles have ceased producing their foul byproducts. I'm walking through an alien cemetery. »

« The soldiers escorting me constantly perform pirouettes with their weapons, trigger-twitchy. But there are no black-hulled monstrosities spitting fire from the shadows or wheeling across the sky. Only rotted mineral sacs drooping from mechanical vines, and decaying chunks of necrotised metal. Even the nerve points that once triggered glandular responses have grown dull. »

Professor Shamus Madigan, Federal scientific liaison to Aegis, discussed these developments via Vox Galactica:

« Multiple pilots introduced Professor Palin's contaminant into the supply lines for these spires, but it's still remarkable how quickly it took effect. With large quantities of the contaminant in place, the Thargoids seem to have abandoned the site in Hyades Sector ST-Q B5-5. Perhaps maintenance drones were unable to keep the site viable for its purpose. Efforts are underway to repeat this success at other sites. »

« What this means for the Thargoid invasion fleets remains unclear as yet. If we are right and the Titans depend upon these biomechanical foundries, the loss of these sites may prove invaluable. But so far \u2013 though Taranis has lost control of surrounding systems \u2013 there is no evidence that the motherships have been affected by the spire sites' inactivity. »


* Tionisla Materials Campaign Fails
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Councillor Nakato Kaine has announced that a delivery campaign in the Tionisla system has not reached its target.

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, she said:

« The purpose of this campaign was to demonstrate the core principles of the Alliance: independence, self-sufficiency and mutual support. While we received millions of units, our target quota was not filled. I believe there are important lessons to be learned here. We must not lose faith in the Alliance's ability to remain self-sustaining in military infrastructure. »

The strategic defence pact between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation is being subjected to an independent inquiry. A vocal minority of councillors in the Assembly are critical of their corporate partner's inability to deliver anti-xeno ships or activities.

Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong Rui offered this comment to reporters:

« Sirius Corporation's continued efforts to supply the Alliance Defence Force with upgraded modules and resources have been hampered by the Alliance Assembly in recent months. Kaine's rogue operation in Tionisla only demonstrates how partisan some of us have become. If the defence pact had received unconditional support, just imagine what triumphs and successes Sirius might have delivered by now. »

The Alliance Rapid-reaction Corps has confirmed that pilots who earned bounty vouchers protecting traders can now collect their rewards from Brett High. The intended discount on the Alliance Challenger, Chieftain and Crusader has been cancelled due to the delivery campaign's failure to reach its targets.


* Utopia Shares Update on Nemesis Failsafe
Simguru Pranav Antal has discussed Utopia's analysis of the designs for a Guardian-based device allegedly constructed by Salvation.

The schematics for the Nemesis Failsafe were unearthed by Seo Jin-ae, who believed that Salvation had developed a way to digitise and relocate his mind upon physical death. Following concerns that Utopia was involved, Aegis shared these designs with the commune to confirm that there was no connection with their Sim-Archive technology.

Pranav Antal recently sent a message to Aegis, which has been made public with Utopia's permission:

« After studying the designs intensively, our neurosmiths have gained some insights into the Nemesis Failsafe. Salvation's unique knowledge of Guardian energy particles and their applications exceeds even our understanding. But we have formulated a theory about what happened when the 'Nemesis protocol' was activated aboard the Bright Sentinel megaship, shortly before its destruction in HIP 22460. »

« I would like to discuss this matter in person with Seo Jin-ae. Her unique experience with Salvation's methods and independent research into his character may help me resolve some remaining questions. »

Vox Galactica's science correspondent Leon Banerjee reported:

« The Nemesis Failsafe question is generally viewed with scepticism, if not outright mockery, among leading exoneurologists. Nobody disputes Salvation's expertise at weaponising Guardian artefacts, but few believe that a living mind could be converted into electromagnetic pulses, even using alien technology. »

« Azimuth Biotech is also dismissive, not just about the science but the very idea that Salvation may have survived. Torben Rademaker has referred to it as 'inappropriate and disrespectful to the memory of our founder Caleb Wycherley.' Nevertheless, Aegis has agreed to transport Seo Jin-ae to meet Pranav Antal, if she accepts his invitation. »


* Help Harksing's Gifts Reach Recipients
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The eccentric inventor Harald Harksing has been causing quite a stir on Angel Station in the Calhuacan system.

Recent reports suggest that the independent entrepreneur is experiencing problems with a corrupted database. This has prevented him from shipping his latest batch of inventions to their intended destinations. The commotion caused by his efforts to resolve the issue has brought both amusement and exasperation to the starport's inhabitants.

Lishan Abara, culture correspondent for Vox Galactica, published a profile piece on Harksing:

« Little of Harald Harksing's background has ever been confirmed. What is well known \u2013 indeed, highly publicised \u2013 is his annual sending of unusual gifts to individuals referenced in GalNet news articles. These mostly comprise of unique toys, gadgets or games that Harksing has designed and built himself, sometimes tailor-made for the recipient. »

« Those who receive Harksing's inventions typically find them charming. The gourmet Giles Cappelleo, for example, was delighted by a chin-mounted palate-cleansing robot. Ambassador Delphine Dumont of the Federal Diplomatic Corps blushed when asked about the 'Furry Yuri' teddy bear that arrived at her office. And Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval admitted that all twelve of his grandchildren adored a card game based on Imperial bloodlines called 'Filial Pursuit'. »

« Harksing himself is always overjoyed at such positive responses. He often claims to be a huge fan of each person, describing them as 'glorious' or 'kings in their field'. Such boyish enthusiasm, coupled with the odd nature of his creations, has made him a local celebrity in a short time. »

« Somewhat cynically, The Tau Ceti Journal described Harald Harksing as: 'A calculating businessman who sends his prototypes to celebrities to secure endorsement and attract investors.' While it is true that several manufacturers have offered contracts to mass-produce his less outlandish inventions, Harksing is more commonly viewed as a joyful and philanthropic figure. »


* Alliance Lifts Quarantine for Thargoid Abductees
The Alliance has ended medical isolation for all citizens who were rescued from the Titans after being abducted by Thargoid vessels.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's official declaration was published by all newsfeeds:

« The Assembly has agreed that quarantine procedures for everyone recovered from the Titans are no longer necessary. Those who hail from an Allied system are being transported from the secure facilities back to their families and communities. Their long nightmare is over. We are sending our people home. »

« I call upon the governments of the Empire, Federation and independent systems to follow our lead with their own citizens. We must not treat these unfortunates as criminals or laboratory specimens. During this dark time of war, let our humanity shine through. »

Some medical institutes such as Kamadhenu Medipure and Vandermeer Corporation opposed the Alliance's decision, claiming that Imperial and Federal returnees should never be allowed back into the general population.   Azimuth Biotech also repeated its offer to perform « cutting-edge xenological detection procedures on every human extracted from a Thargoid bio-storage capsule. »

The political dimension was analysed by Vanya Driscoll for The Alliance Tribune:

« Prime Minister Mahon knows that this will be a popular decision, after many public figures called the extended quarantine 'inhumane' and 'barbaric'. Plus, with his rival Councillor Kaine currently questioning the wisdom of the Mahon-endorsed strategic defence pact with Sirius, the timing of this benevolent act could not be better. »

« On the wider political stage, asking the other superpowers to follow suit frames the Alliance as a more humanitarian society than its counterparts. This may be a rare occasion when the Empire and Federation are looking to us for moral guidance\u2026 or at least, waiting to see if sending home thousands of Thargoid abductees is a mistake. »


* Seo Jin-ae Departs Utopia in Silence
Seo Jin-ae has returned from a visit to Utopia following an invitation from Simguru Pranav Antal to discuss the possibility of Salvation's survival.

The leader of the Utopia commune invited her to review the schematics that she recovered from an abandoned Azimuth Corporation facility in March. The schematics detailed a mysterious Guardian-based device named the Nemesis Failsafe. Seo Jin-ae believes this was used by Salvation to transfer his living mind to a remote location before his death in HIP 22460.

Aegis confirmed that it has no information about the meeting in Utopia, and that Seo Jin-ae refused to discuss the matter with them upon her return.

Pranav Antal transmitted a message that was shared across public newsfeeds:

« My sincere thanks to Seo Jin-ae for allowing me to explain my theories about Salvation's 'Nemesis protocol'. We have agreed not to disclose our conclusions. I must respect that Seo's experiences with Salvation, along with her present goals, are very personal to her. It is my hope that Utopia's findings are useful to her in some way. »

« A far more significant message that I would like to share concerns the increasing likelihood of humanity's extinction. I speak not of the Thargoid war, but the ceaseless rivalries wrought by our innate tribalism. Now that our communities have become interstellar superpowers, this flaw in our nature could lead to the collapse of civilisation amid fire and ruin. »

« In the past, I have urged leaders to abandon militaristic posturing in favour of diplomacy. We must focus on what draws us together rather than our differences. Utopia will continue to serve as an exemplar of this philosophy, which may one day steer us toward a more holistic path. »


* Federation Extends Quarantine for Thargoid Abductees
Federal citizens who were captured by Thargoids then rescued from the Titans will not yet be permitted to leave secure medical facilities.

The decision comes after the Alliance ended quarantine restrictions for returnees from their systems, with newly rescued civilians expected to spend no more than a week in observation. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has called on other governments to do the same.

President Zachary Hudson discussed the situation during a press conference:

« The consensus of Federal medical experts is that it would be foolishly optimistic to allow these people \u2013 some of whom were held aboard the Titans for months \u2013 back into the general population. When at war with such an implacable enemy as the Thargoids, we simply cannot afford to take any risks. »

« Rest assured that Federal citizens are not suffering in any way. They are allowed to receive visitors, albeit without physical contact, and have full comms and media access. But they will remain under observation for the time being. »

President-elect Felicia Winters, whose term of office is due to begin early next year, explained her viewpoint:

« Once I am sworn in as president, bringing our people home will be one of my top priorities. The experts referred to by President Hudson have reached no such consensus. Instead, their meticulous tests reveal no evidence whatsoever that former abductees have been influenced or physically compromised by the Thargoids. »

« Nevertheless, I am mindful of the public concern. To that end, I will instruct the Department of Health and Wellness to closely monitor all rescued citizens once they have returned home, including mandatory medical checks. This should allay fears and minimise any social ostracism these individuals may face. »


* Thargoid War Update: December 3309
As the year draws to a close, Jade Sanderlyn reflects on humanity's ongoing conflict against the Thargoids in a summary for Vox Galactica.

« We began 3309 reeling under the colossal impact brought by the Maelstroms, which had arrived on the fringes of the core systems. Unleashed from within these corrosive clouds were Thargoid attacks on a scale never seen before. Hundreds of systems fell rapidly, with the current death toll over a billion. Billions more were forced to flee from their burning homes. »

« It was months before the Thargoid motherships within the Maelstroms were revealed. The Titans remain in place to this day, seemingly indestructible. Their unearthly horror was enhanced when it became clear that they are also prisons for living humans abducted by the aliens. »

« With a reformed Aegis in place, our resistance to these invasions grew stronger over the months. Many fallen systems were recovered, and courageous pilots destroyed countless Thargoid vessels. Their efforts were boosted by technological breakthroughs such as the pulse wave xeno scanner, Thargoid pulse neutraliser and sub-surface extraction missile. »

« More recently, a contaminant developed by Professor Ishmael Palin proved effective against the Thargoid spire sites that emerged on dozens of planets. Another recent success was the clearing of all systems around Taranis. This raises the prospect that other Thargoid fleets could be beaten back to their motherships. »

« Perhaps the most incredible victory is the liberation of hundreds of thousands of abducted people from captivity within the Titans. All were kept in strict quarantine since their return, undergoing tests to ensure that they were not somehow influenced by the Thargoids. »

« Now, however, the Alliance has decided to allow its citizens to return home. Other governments are more cautious, but this has not stopped returnees from receiving gifts, calls and visits from their friends and families. There has been a concerted effort to alleviate their horrific ordeal and reconnect with them as much as possible. »

« And so, as 3310 dawns, there is real hope that this most terrible period of history may have some end in sight. This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there. »


* Empire Continues 'Protective Sanctuary' for Abductees
Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has decided that all Imperial citizens recovered from Thargoid Titans will remain in quarantine indefinitely.

An official pronouncement on behalf of the Emperor was distributed by the Imperial Palace:

« Every subject of the Empire who was abducted by the Thargoids is receiving the highest possible quality of treatment and support. The Emperor has ordered that they will be given exemplary medical and psychological care, for as long as they remain in medical isolation. »

« As is always the case, the security of our society is paramount. Protective sanctuary is being provided for tens of thousands of individuals, in order that billions are spared the prospect \u2013 however unlikely \u2013 of an alien influence taking root within the Empire. That is the honourable path, and the Emperor is confident her people will understand the wisdom of this decision. »

The Imperial Herald's political journalist Cassia Carvalho analysed the ramifications:

« It is unusual for the actions of other superpowers to be acknowledged these days, but the issue of detaining Thargoid abductees has crossed all borders. In this case, the Alliance's decision to allow them to return home has prompted Her Majesty to insist that keeping them in isolation is for the greater good. »

« Court insiders revealed that Princess Aisling Duval sought a personal audience with the Emperor, hoping to convince her to lift the quarantine. I'm told that this was refused in no uncertain terms, coupled with the suggestion that the Princess should focus her attention on her Aegis assignment. »

« The Imperial Palace also responded to Kamadhenu Medipure, which has called for all abductees to be relocated to deep space and possibly euthanised. The company was thanked for its 'robust proposals', but instructed to leave such considerations to the Senate. »


* Sirius CEO Faces Assembly Inquiry
Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, has addressed the Alliance Assembly as part of its formal inquiry into the strategic defence pact.

The inquiry was proposed by Councillor Nakato Kaine, who highlighted the lack of military support provided by the megacorp against the Thargoids.

When invited to explain why most of Sirius Corporation's plans have not materialised, Li Yong-Rui said:

« Many new anti-xeno ship configurations were designed for the Alliance Defence Force and have been applied to thousands of ships. But we have encountered many obstacles along the way, which have severely undermined our progress. »

« Usually these obstacles are bureaucratic in nature, but sometimes we simply cannot communicate effectively with the necessary individuals. I find it hard not to conclude that our progress is being deliberately impeded by forces within government departments. Sadly, not everyone shares Prime Minister Mahon's vision of using our resources and expertise to enhance Alliance naval capabilities. »

Councillor Kaine directly challenged this statement, accusing Yong-Rui of failing to honour his responsibilities. He responded:

« May I remind the honourable councillor of her recent failed endeavour in the Tionisla system to 'prove the Alliance doesn't depend on Sirius'. While the Alliance is a powerful entity with considerable resources, the lack of engagement in Kaine's campaign suggests Sirius's involvement remains vital. Our company now handles many of the ADF's routine logistical supplies, far more efficiently than before. Like it or not, we are here to stay. »

The inquiry into the strategic defence pact is expected to conduct more interviews within both Sirius Corporation and relevant Allied organisations. Admiral Nikolas Glass and other members of the Council of Admirals have also agreed to submit their observations.


* Zemina Torval Returns to the Senate
The Imperial Senate has formally welcomed back Senator Zemina Torval, following an absence of several months.

Torval's reappearance put an end to rumours that she was suffering from ill health. Her youngest daughter, Senator Petra Torval, had been standing in for her mother by representing the Imperial populace of the Synteini system.

Addressing the Senate, Zemina Torval said:

« I am grateful to this august body, and to Her Majesty the Emperor, for permitting me a short respite from my duties. I have used this time to fully discharge my corporate responsibilities. As is common knowledge, ownership of Torval Mining Ltd has been transferred to my eldest daughter Constantia. She will ensure that Imperial industries continue to be supplied with vital mineral resources. »

« My attention is now fully focused on my senatorial work. This is where I have best served the Empire, and will continue to do so for many years to come. »

Cassia Carvalho, political correspondent for The Imperial Herald, observed:

« At 132 years old, Zemina Torval is one of the oldest serving members of the Senate. During her decades of service she has made many enemies, all of whom must have been deeply irritated to see her return, looking and sounding as formidable as ever. »

« The reason she avoided retirement could be that Chancellor Anders Blaine is considering taking that route for himself. Due to her seniority, Torval has temporarily deputised as chancellor on more than one occasion. If Blaine stands down and the most powerful position in the Senate becomes vacant, that would certainly justify Torval's decision to focus exclusively on her political career. »


* Guardian Relics Needed for Anti-Titan Research
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The engineer Ram Tah requires urgent deliveries of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics to the Meene system.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, made an announcement to launch the initiative:

« Since the arrival of the Thargoid Titans, we have developed several new modules to bypass their defences. But these motherships remain a constant presence in our space, continuing to unleash never-ending swarms of Thargoid vessels. »

« A recent theory presented by Ram Tah has the potential to change this situation. Although details of his research remain classified for the moment, the theory is derived from the Thargoids' inherent vulnerability to the technologies of their ancient enemy, the Guardians. Having witnessed Ram Tah's laboratory tests only yesterday, I was hugely encouraged that his work could lead to the end of this devastating war. »

« Aegis is doing everything it can to support this crucial initiative. We therefore request deliveries of Guardian relics, as well as the Unclassified relics that are created when these crystalline objects are inserted into an ancient Thargoid surface site. Quantities of both objects are needed to rapidly refine Ram Tah's theory and develop prototypes. Ram Tah has promised to reveal more details to the public should these prototypes succeed. »

Aegis has asked that Guardian relics and Unclassified relics be delivered to Felice Dock in the Meene system, the site of Ram Tah's workshop.


* Winters Appoints Future Cabinet Members
President-elect Felicia Winters has officially selected new heads for each executive department of the Federal government.

She announced her choices during a session of Congress, where she gave a short speech about her upcoming presidency. This was followed by a similar statement from Isolde Rochester, who will serve as Winters's vice president.

Sofia Trevino, political journalist for The Federal Times, reported:

« With these appointments, Felicia Winters is laying the foundations on which to build a new Federal government. Long-serving figures in the Liberal Party are finally being rewarded with key positions in the upcoming administration. »

« One notable loyalist is Congressman Bai Zheng, who will be Secretary for Security. She is already well-known for opposing the Proactive Detection Bureau, and will undoubtedly take pleasure in overseeing the surveillance unit's closure, as per Winters's campaign promise. »

« Congressman Kristine Lasky is another familiar name. Her celebrated role in creating the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which enables superpowers to collaborate during emergencies, makes her a solid choice for Secretary of State. »

« There are a few fresher faces among the forthcoming Cabinet. The new Grand Attorney will be Pierre-Marc Pelletier, a former director of the Federal Attorney's Office. And the Secretary for Defence will be Congressman Conn Montgomery, who will have to navigate demands from a Federal Navy accustomed to Zachary Hudson's generous military budgets. »

In related news, planning is underway for Felicia Winters's inauguration ceremony to take place in mid-February. President Hudson's office has confirmed that handover procedures are well advanced, with all government agencies and departments preparing for the Federation's new leadership.


* Guardian Deliveries Accelerate Anti-Titan Project
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Shipments of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics have boosted hopes of developing a weapon against the Thargoid Titans.

The Aegis-led initiative gathered supplies of the crystalline relics left behind by the Guardian species, as well as the Unclassified relics that result when they interface with Thargoid surface sites.

These were requested to support a project based on new theories expounded by the engineer Ram Tah, considered the leading expert on Guardian history and technology.

Aden Tanner, who works as an anti-xeno strategist for Aegis, made a brief comment to Vox Galactica:

« As always, we're grateful to every pilot who took part to support Aegis. I don't mind sharing that Ram Tah is delighted, and is currently refining his theory with the aid of specialists from all three superpowers. »

« We hope to reveal more details very soon, but at this point it's worth managing expectations around the proposed anti-Titan weapon. It remains true that our existing armaments are incapable of inflicting damage on Thargoid motherships. But if Ram Tah is correct, we may be able to reveal certain vulnerabilities by exploiting a newly discovered aspect of Guardian technology. »

A spokesperson from Aegis also revealed that Professor Palin is supporting Ram Tah's research, stating: « The most prominent engineers of our age are once again working together to defend humanity against the Thargoid threat. »

Aegis has confirmed that all participants in the delivery campaign can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.


* Harvest Thargoid Materials for Anti-Titan Project
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis is urgently requesting deliveries of Thargoid spire site materials to Professor Ishmael Palin in the Arque system.

The alien minerals are needed for vital research based on a new theory by the engineer Ram Tah. His research has suggested a method of defeating the Thargoid Titans, although details of the proposal remain classified by Aegis.

Professor Palin, the leading expert in Thargoid biotechnology, explained the initiative:

« I am confident that Ram Tah's theory holds water, and we are working together on its practical applications. There are no guarantees as yet, but we could be on the cusp of developing a weapon with which to engage the Titans. »

« However, such a weapon must be able to function within the Maelstroms' electromagnetic fields, which disrupt all Guardian-based technology. I am developing a resistant armour using the organic compounds produced by Thargoid spire sites. »

Aegis has cautioned pilots that operating within the spire sites is highly dangerous, and that they are likely to encounter Thargoid vessels as well as defensive drones. Anti-xeno strategist Aden Tanner commented:

« I won't pretend to understand all the science behind Ram Tah and Palin's work. But what little I've seen made me feel something very rare these days: hope. There's never been a more crucial time for everyone to rally together, and perhaps help us achieve the impossible. »

Deliveries of coral sap, impure spire minerals and semi-refined spire minerals can be made at Austen Town Station in the Arque system.


* Anti-Titan Project Boosted by Thargoid Spire Materials
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Chemicals harvested from Thargoid spire sites have accelerated Aegis's development of a weapon to destroy the Titans.

Professor Ishmael Palin requested samples of coral sap, impure spire minerals and semi-refined spire minerals, which were delivered to the Arque system. These will be used to produce an armoured layer to protect the weapon against the Maelstroms' anti-Guardian zones.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, explained more at a press conference:

« I am well aware that obtaining these substances from the Thargoid spire sites has doubtless cost lives. But the importance of this work cannot be overstated. Without resistance to the Maelstroms' electromagnetic fields, the weapon based on Ram Tah's theory is doomed to failure. »

« The Alliance, Empire and Federation have all agreed to redirect the majority of Aegis funding to the anti-Titan project. We have also drafted in extra help to construct prototypes and fast-track testing procedures. Although details remain classified, if the results continue to be positive, we may be able to go public in as little as a week. »

Aegis has confirmed that all those who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Austen Town Station in the Arque system.


* Catastrophic Earthquakes Strike Rhea 3
A series of high-magnitude earthquakes on the planet Rhea 3 have caused widespread devastation and millions of casualties.

Massive seismic activity across the northern continent has effectively shattered dozens of towns and cities, including the capital New Greenacre. The intense tremors also triggered tsunamis in the surrounding oceans, which have wrecked coastal regions on other land masses.

Local journalist Len Kennelly  published a summary for Vox Galactica:

« The only disaster on this scale that we've seen in Rhea was when NMLA terrorists bombed Ito Orbital. This time, however, the death toll could run into tens of millions. Urban skylines have crumbled like sandcastles, with vast jagged pits opening up to swallow entire neighbourhoods. »

« Federal Liberal Command has declared the highest state of emergency, calling for volunteers to help rescue trapped citizens. We're seeing direct support from other factions in the system, and Federal Navy specialists are coordinating relief efforts. The humanitarian organisation Safeguard Interstellar is also here in force, providing supplies and temporary shelters for survivors. »

Sofia Trevino, political correspondent for The Federal Times, reported:

« As soon as this news broke, President-elect Felicia Winters \u2013 a native of Rhea 3 and the system's representative in Congress \u2013 immediately cancelled her schedule and travelled to her homeworld. Unverified reports claim that contact has been lost with members of her family, most of whom lived in the capital. »

« Speculation has already begun that this might cause further delays to the beginning of Winters's term of office. Vice President-elect Isolde Rochester made a statement asking for patience, claiming: 'Our focus right now should be on aiding those affected by this tragedy.' »


* Guardian Nanite Torpedoes Enter Production
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Deliveries are urgently needed to begin manufacturing a new weapon capable of causing severe damage to Thargoid Titans.

Professor Ishmael Palin has been leading on the project, using theories developed by Ram Tah. Aegis released an official statement on all newsfeeds:

« We can now reveal the results of Ram Tah's experiments into Guardian relics. These ancient objects were crystalline supercomputers that relayed data across the Guardians' information networks. His theory was that their transformation into Unclassified relics at Thargoid surface sites was caused by an inbuilt defence mechanism, which could perhaps be weaponised. »

« Ram Tah discovered that exposure to certain electromagnetic frequencies caused Guardian relics to open and activate clusters of microscopic nanites. These react aggressively against Thargoid biotechnology by disrupting it on the molecular level. Most significantly, tests proved that these nanites are unaffected by the anti-Guardian field generated within Maelstroms. »

« Professor Palin, aided by Aegis technicians, has used Guardian-hybrid engineering to construct a 'soft' warhead that delivers a nanite payload. The torpedo is armoured using organic compounds from Thargoid spire sites, to prevent anti-Guardian fields affecting it in flight. Our strategists believe that these weapons could affect a Titan's heat regulation systems, causing internal damage and eventually even total destruction. »

« Mass production of the Guardian nanite torpedo and its launcher module has begun. But further supplies are needed to construct enough for simultaneous attacks against all eight Thargoid motherships. »

Aegis has asked for shipments of neofabric insulation, ion distributors and energy grid assemblies  to be delivered to Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system. The initiative is being managed by YZ Ceti Blue Galactic and Co, which aims to protect deliveries by redeeming bounty vouchers on all wanted ships.


* Winters Pauses Inauguration After Rhea Disaster
President-elect Felicia Winters has delayed the start of her term of office, in response to devastating earthquakes on the planet Rhea 3.

The following statement was delivered by her office to a special session of Congress:

« The terrible events on Rhea 3 have not only demanded President-elect Winters's full attention, but also brought personal tragedy. It seems that most of the Winters family, plus many close friends, lost their lives when the capital city of New Greenacre was levelled by the earthquakes. »

« The president-elect therefore requests permission to temporarily suspend the inauguration ceremony. This will allow her to focus on coordinating emergency operations, and also process the unexpected loss of her nearest and dearest. »

President Zachary Hudson agreed to a short extension of his presidential term, thereby allowing the motion to be passed by Congress. Vice President-elect Isolde Rochester will assume leadership of the Liberal Party on an interim basis until Felicia Winters is available.

Vox Galactica published an update from local reporter Len Kennelly:

« Rescue operations on the northern continent have intensified in recent days, as more ships and equipment arrive from across the Federation. I'm told that nearly a million survivors, albeit many injured, have now been recovered. But continual aftershocks are still toppling unstable buildings, leaving entire cities lying in dust. »

The Empirical scientific journal also discussed the cause of the disaster:

« High-magnitude earthquakes are extremely rare on terraformed planets such as Rhea 3. Initial geological surveys usually detect this type of tectonic instability, to avoid establishing settlements in dangerous regions. These destructive tremors prove that despite having tamed many worlds with our technology, nature can still be unpredictable. »


* Target the Titans \u2013 Guardian Nanite Torpedoes Released
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

Aegis is preparing concerted attacks against Thargoid Titans using the new weapons now available at rescue megaships.

A successful delivery campaign brought in enough supplies of neofabric insulation, ion distributors and energy grid assemblies to mass-produce the Guardian nanite torpedoes. YZ Ceti Blue Galactic and Co, acting on Aegis's behalf, is distributing rewards and reimbursing bounty vouchers from Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system.

A press conference was held by Aegis leadership, including a statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:

« The Guardian nanite torpedo is our most important invention yet. Once again, we are utilising the advanced sciences of the Thargoids' ancient adversary. And once again, we are relying on pilots' skill and determination to face the Titans at close quarters. »

« I am painfully aware that many abducted people are still in captivity aboard the Thargoid motherships. Scan results suggest that the majority have now been rescued, but those remaining may not survive these attacks. We are forced to accept that their sacrifice will result in fewer deaths than if the Titans are allowed to remain operational. »

Anti-xeno strategist Aden Tanner discussed Aegis's tactical approach:

« These torpedoes must be aimed at the thermal vents on a Titan's hull. A sufficiently large payload of Guardian nanites should paralyse these vents. The mothership will be forced to discharge the colossal heat it generates by exposing its inner regions to space. That will provide us with sensitive targets for more conventional weaponry to inflict serious \u2013 hopefully critical \u2013 damage. »

« Aegis has marshalled Allied, Federal and Imperial ships to undertake this mission, but we calculate they will not be enough. Only with the support of independent Commanders can we hope to deliver enough nanites to affect each Titan. This could prove to be the most important victory in humanity's history\u2026 or our most devastating defeat. Now, more than ever, we need you all. »


* The Assault on Taranis
Titan Taranis is under siege, taking major damage, and close to presenting a major turning point in the war against the Thargoids. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of a Titan.

A recent surge of financial support has allowed Aegis to remove the material requirements for the following key modules:

- The Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser \u2013 the key to punching through the maelstrom's defensive field and reach the centre.

- The Caustic Sink Launcher \u2013 a valuable tool to protect ships from the aggressive caustic fog permeating the cloud around the Titan.

This funding originated from numerous groups and individuals following the news about Ram Tah's Guardian Nanite Torpedo technology being deployed to great effect against Taranis. Aegis wish to express that humanity will be forever grateful to those who risked their lives to make this happen.

Good luck, Commanders.


* Thargoid War Bulletin: Titan Destroyed
Titan Taranis, one of the eight Thargoid motherships, is presumed destroyed after a concerted attack using Guardian nanite torpedoes.

The journalist Jade Sanderlyn published a bulletin via Vox Galactica:

« We're receiving incredible news from the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system, where independent pilots were supporting Aegis's assaults against the Titans. The new Guardian nanite torpedoes have proved effective against the Titans' thermal vents, forcing their hulls to open and vent internal heat. And that has allowed Commanders to target the core of each gigantic ship. »

« What were believed to be Taranis's death throes were closely observed. A massive release of energy repulsed all ships, followed by further explosions. At present the Titan's status cannot be verified, due to an intensely corrosive gas cloud that prevents ships from approaching. Aegis is confident, however, that the detonations were fatal. »

« It's too early to analyse what this means for the ongoing Thargoid war. But this looks like a significant victory, proving that these giants can be toppled after all. As attacks continue against the seven remaining Titans, we will follow these developments closely. »


* Titan Taranis destruction yields extensive data for research projects
The recent destruction of Titan Taranis has yielded a significant amount of data that scientists across the galaxy have begun interrogating.

Science correspondent Leon Banerjee summarised for Vox Galactica:

« Research on Titans has been ongoing since their first appearance, and understanding how they function has been considered crucial to humanity's survival in the Thargoid war. »

« I have spent time with everyone from the smallest private research bodies to the largest corporations in the past few years, and the common anxiety amongst the scientific community is still how little we truly understand about the Titans. »

« What answers does the caustic remnant of Taranis contain? What might have survived the destruction? When the wreckage is safe enough to enter, the additional data to be found there will doubtless benefit humanity in some form. »


* The Assault on Leigong
*Pilots' Federation Alert*

Titan Leigong is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of a second Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

\u2022 Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser \u2013 To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

\u2022 Caustic Sink Launchers \u2013 To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

\u2022 Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon \u2013 To hamper the Titan's vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.


* Thargoid War Bulletin: Second Titan Defeated
Titan Leigong in the HIP 8887 system has been eliminated, following the same tactical approach used against Taranis.

Vox Galactica's Jade Sanderlyn reported:

« Two of the eight Thargoid Titans have now been put out of action. Leigong suffered the same fate as Taranis, with its core being targeted by a sustained bombardment. »

« Aegis is overjoyed at these results. Both Professor Palin and Ram Tah are being praised for their development of the Guardian nanite torpedo, which is crucial to these attacks. And word is spreading that the Thargoid war machine has suffered a critical defeat, one that may change the entire conflict. Can these victories be repeated a further six times? »


* Achilles Aerospace urges pilots to plunder Titan wreckage
Intense investment into research on Titan travel has been announced by the aerospace subdivision of the famed robotics company.

Their research has been centred on the method used by the Thargoid Titans to travel at speeds well beyond that of humanity's current technological capacity.

A spokesperson for Achilles Aerospace had this to say:

« For so long now, the means of space travel have been controlled by one company in a strict monopoly. Under that monopoly, progress seems to have stagnated entirely. But Achilles is a corporation built on the iteration and refinement of technology, and we intend to bring space travel into a new age. »

« We have been limited to observational data alone so far, but that is no longer the case. The remnant of Taranis is now accessible, and within it lies the missing component to our work. We urge pilots to venture to the wreckage of the destroyed Titan and try to obtain one of the rare Titan Drive Components. Achilles Aerospace will pay generously for any that are sold to Bloch Station in the Ethgreze system. » Experts warn that the Taranis site remains extremely dangerous. Caustic sinks should be equipped, and care should be taken due to reports of Thargoid ships active in the area.


* Titan Oya deploys a surprise fleet of Orthrus vessels
The Titan known as Oya appears to have deployed a large fleet of Orthrus vessels into star systems farther from their own territory breaking expected behaviour.

Analysts noted that the locations in which Orthrus vessels have been tracked didn't appear to have any particular importance, instead suggesting that this may be a new tactic or possibly a simple panic response to the mounting pressure on its fleet.

Titan Oya has been steadily losing territory to large numbers of AX-equipped human forces. These forces, spearheaded by coalitions known as 'AXI' and 'XSF' have been reclaiming ground from the Titans successfully for some time and were pivotal in the recent successful campaigns against the now-destroyed Titans, Taranis and Leigong.

The Pilots' Federation have issued an alert to all independent pilots for each of the star systems where Orthrus vessels have been detected:

« If Oya can be prevented from reclaiming territory, then it's likely that this third Titan will fall within mere weeks. We encourage all pilots to track and eliminate any Orthrus vessels found patrolling these star systems before the Thargoids can move their assault forces into these footholds. »


* Prototype Frame Shift Drive almost production ready, competitor sceptical
Material gathered from the Titan Taranis wreckage has reportedly allowed Achilles Aerospace to complete the research on their prototype Frame Shift Drive.

The recent initiative sponsored by Achilles Aerospace saw over 5000 independent pilots enter the hazardous wreckage of Titan Taranis, retrieving enough Titan Drive Components to allow Achilles to allegedly design a new type of Frame Shift Drive based on Titan technology.

A spokesperson for Achilles Aerospace gave the following update:

The Achilles Corporation would like to commend every brave pilot that responded to our request. The data we are gathering from the collected materials is staggering, and our work has progressed at an astonishing rate. Our teams are hard at work getting the prototype ready for production as I speak, and we are eager to show you all the fruits of our labour very soon.

Sirius Corporation, the current sole manufacturer of Frame Shift Drives, was asked for comment on this research:

« Sirius recognises Achilles' claims of 'revolutionising' an extremely advanced technology in a relatively short span of time, but we remain unconvinced of their substance. If Achilles can produce something other than words we will be happy to comment further. »


* New Supercruise Overcharge module enters the market, a « turning point for humanity »
Achilles Aerospace have begun mass distribution of their own Frame Shift Drive modules, capable of what their marketing is calling an 'Overcharged' Supercruise.

This news follows the corporation urging pilots to gather Titan Drive Components from the dangerous remnants of destroyed Titans. The data gathered from the components seems to have been the catalyst to finalise what were previously only theoretical designs.

The new modules are capable of incredible speeds, much like the Titans themselves. The power of this new Frame Shift Drive does, however, put immense pressure on a ship when used.

In a speech at the private launch event for the module, held at Achilles headquarters, Achilles Aerospace chairman Maxine Patro said:

« As of right now, our new modules have been distributed across the galaxy, and we fully expect that this will not only be a turning point in history for Achilles, but for the whole of humanity. We have truly revolutionised supercruise and, with this leap, we take another step out from under the Thargoids' technological shadow. Thank you, Achilles engineers. »


* Anti-Guardian field project yields breakthrough - New modifications available
*Pilots' Federation ALERT*

The engineer Ram Tah has discovered a method of immunising existing Guardian modules against the effects of anti-Guardian fields.

Earlier this year, Ram Tah discovered that certain Guardian relics revealed and activated nanite clusters when exposed to specific electromagnetic frequencies. These nanites proved disruptive to Thargoid technology on a molecular level and, importantly, were entirely unaffected by anti-Guardian fields unlike other Guardian technology.

In an urgent press conference, Aegis leadership announced a breakthrough in researching that latter quality.

The following statement was given by Professor Alba Tesreau:

« Our knowledge of the Thargoids' ancient adversary, the Guardians, is still so very limited, and yet Guardian technology has once again paved a way forward for humanity. »

« We urge pilots to use the modifications we are producing to utilise any powerful Guardian modules in their possession. Use them to push back against the Thargoid threat. Use them to win this war. »

Aegis went on to announce that the modifications can now be made at Ram Tah's workshop in the Meene system.


* The Assault on Oya
*Pilots' Federation Alert*

Titan Oya is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of the third Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

\u2022 Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser \u2013 To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

\u2022 Caustic Sink Launchers \u2013 To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

\u2022 Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon \u2013 To hamper the Titan's vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.


* Thargoid War Bulletin: Oya Successfully Attacked
Titan Oya in the Cephei Sector BV-Y B4 system has been confirmed as destroyed by Aegis, leaving five still operational.

Aden Tanner, Aegis's lead anti-xeno strategist, delivered a cautionary statement:

« I must remind all Commanders that these missions are highly dangerous and cannot be undertaken lightly. Entering a Maelstrom and flying close to a Titan requires your ship to be outfitted with caustic sink launchers and Thargoid pulse neutralisers. AX weaponry will also prove useful, as will Guardian nanite torpedoes to target the Titans' thermal vents. »

« Be warned that your combat skills will be tested. Counter-attacks by Thargoid vessels become more frequent as the Titans take damage , and the mothership's own turrets are deployed more aggressively. I would like to see veteran anti-xeno pilots passing on their knowledge to less-experienced pilots, to prevent unnecessary risks. »


* Ship manufacturers must « rise to the challenge » of Supercruise Overcharge
Users of the Supercruise Overcharge function of Achilles' new Frame Shift Drives have reported that the module puts ships under immense mechanical and thermal stress, often causing severe hull damage. Ship manufacturers throughout the galaxy are now diverting research towards overcoming this issue.

Stent Jackson, a ship engineering and design consultant, spoke to Vox Galactica about this new surge of research:

« Now don't get me wrong, every manufacturer I've spoken to considers Supercruise Overcharge to be a great thing, but it's also ripping our hulls apart. The good with the bad, as always. »

« Funny thing is, every manufacturer is realising all at once that there are some crucial things about ship construction that they've all taken for granted. When you get down to brass tacks, we assume certain thresholds, right? Before, we didn't need to worry about exceeding certain temperatures or hitting high levels of hull stress regularly. Now that's all out the window. »

« I haven't seen such a single-minded focus from ship manufacturers for a long time. They're all clawing to be first to market with a ship that can alleviate Overcharge stress, and it's not long before one of them really does rise to the challenge. »

\My hat's off to them, Achilles have changed the game in the industry for good. »


* Python Mk II Released: Faulcon DeLacy announces collaboration with Achilles Aerospace
The first ever ship built entirely around Achilles' new Frame Shift Drive has released today, the Python Mk II. Marketing materials are pushing the tagline: « Built for Supercruise Overcharge ».

Faulcon DeLacy, the widely respected manufacturer behind this new ship, released a statement this morning:

« The original Python is an incredibly versatile ship, serving countless pilots in countless roles around the universe. For the Mk II, we wanted to create something more specialised and focused, and so we are coming to market with a ship that truly excels in battle conditions...  but that's not all. »

« Thanks to a fruitful collaboration with our friends at Achilles Aerospace, the Python Mk II has been designed from the ground up to better handle their new Frame Shift Drive. »

« It has improved heat management, better handling, reduced fuel consumption, and even better acceleration and deceleration capacity. »

« With the Python Mk II, we are breaking almost every speed record humanity has set. This is truly the flagship of a new era, and we cannot wait for you to try it. »

Faulcon DeLacy famously has a well-established relationship with the other main manufacturer of Frame Shift Drives, Sirius Corporation. Vox Galactica reached out for a comment on this announcement, but Sirius rejected the request.


* Achilles Aerospace releases full selection of Supercruise Overcharge modules
A suite of new Supercruise Overcharge Frame Shift Drives entered the market earlier this week alongside several other upgrades to the new modules.

To celebrate the company's recent success, Dr. Namin Tirel, Achilles Aerospace's Head of Research and Development, offered a rare interview to Vox Galactica:

« It boggles the mind, truly. We were working in secret on what would eventually become our Supercruise Overcharge technology for over a year now. We had mountains of data and plenty of theories still to test, but we were struggling to make headway on anything that had real practical application. When we got hold of some of the actual parts of the Thargoids' drive-like technology, all that time, energy, and financial investment finally paid off. We were able to make huge strides in a short time frame, as you're now seeing. »

« We purposefully made these drives difficult to modify as they're still using very new technology, but, with how well the drives are holding up, we saw fit to relax this restriction. »

« Our latest firmware update also removes the prototype safety limiter on jump range which goes hand-in-hand with some brilliant fine-tuning we achieved during development. Not only are our drives capable of Supercruise Overcharge but we saw a few optimisations we could make over Sirius' aging technology. If you want to go both faster and further, switch to an Achilles drive. »

« Finally, we have our work with Faulcon DeLacy on their Python Mk II. This is something that both companies are immensely happy with, and we want to offer this same collaborative approach to other manufacturers too. »

« Supercruise Overcharge has been a highlight of my career, and being a part of its continued development is a privilege. Thank you to my team helping to create the next phase of space travel, and a special thank you to the independent pilots who brought us the key pieces of technology that made all of this possible. »


* The Assault on Hadad
*Pilots' Federation Alert*

Titan Hadad is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of the fourth Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

\u2022 Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser \u2013 To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

\u2022 Caustic Sink Launchers \u2013 To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

\u2022 Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon \u2013 To hamper the Titan's vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.


* Repel Pirates and Provide Aid to De Caminha Station
*PILOTS FEDERATION ALERT*

Reports are coming in that the strained De Caminha station has been the target of increased levels of pirate attacks.

Jerome Archer has announced a growing state of concern among parts of Federation space, stating that the war has spread supplies and support too thin amongst their territories.

Archer currently remains the Vice President of the Federation until President-elect Felicia Winters returns from supporting her home planet of Rhea 3, which is still recovering from a series of devastating earthquakes.

At an emergency conference, Jerome Archer stated the following:

« The good work that the Federation is doing in the fight against the Thargoids is noble, and valuable, but it takes its toll. Our president, Zachary Hudson, has done an excellent job maintaining the Federation in spite of this, but we can only do so much. »

« It pains me to see De Caminha be the target of attacks by criminals looking to take advantage of the Federation's continued efforts to end the war as quickly as possible, so I am calling on pilots across the galaxy for aid. »

« I urge you to hunt down the aggressors and supply the Earth Defence Fleet stationed in De Caminha with the medicines and equipment to prevent further attacks. Only by doing both will the station be safe again. »

« Any help is appreciated, and will be rewarded. »


* Aegis Wary About Changing Thargoid Behaviour
A recent behavioural change in the Thargoids has prompted urgent discussion among Aegis researchers and strategists.

Since the fall of the fourth Titan, Hadad, there are increasing reports that the Thargoid expansion efforts have been growing weaker. While Thargoids are continuing to expand outwards from the Titans, they are no longer reinforcing their spire sites.  Further, independent squadrons dedicated to defeating the Thargoid threat like SNPX, AXI, and MUDD, have noted increasing ease in thwarting attempts to probe and invade systems.

Dr. Ivano Colombera, Imperial Science Academy's director of xenological studies and Empire liaison to Aegis, gave their view:

« I have heard the strategy reports touting words like 'weakening Thargoid presence', and I must urge caution. I hypothesise that this change signals a strategic defensive response, not an enemy on their last legs. »

« I believe that the Thargoids are consolidating and planning, with the likely aim of reinforcing the final four Titans to prevent further losses. They may seem 'weak' now, yes, but everything we know of Thargoid behaviour suggests that this change shepherds something else. We are backing them into a corner, but that is when any creature is at its most unpredictable. And at its most dangerous. »

Aegis has urged pilots across the galaxy to take this warning seriously and work to end the war before the Thargoids have time to retaliate. Humanity's war effort is currently directed towards Titan Indra.


* De Caminha Station Has Been Successfully Reinforced
The pirates attacking De Caminha have been eliminated, and supplies have been provided to prevent further attacks.

Jerome Archer offered his thanks in an announcement this morning:

« Time and time again, I am impressed by the skill and compassion of the galaxy's pilots. Security for Federation citizens is my number one priority, and it pains me that a station in our space could be the target of opportunistic low lives, but through your efforts this station is once again secure and ready if those pirates return. Rewards are now available to those who helped in the defence efforts. »

« But I am compelled to raise the question on everyone's mind: will this situation be better when Felicia Winters finally assumes office? A President-elect who, I remind you, seems uninterested in the security of her citizens. Who wants to shut down resources like the PDB, which has saved many, many lives already. »

« Is she a president capable of maintaining peace, when aggressors are increasingly appearing from all sides? »

« Or is she a president who puts her ideals before the lives of her people? »

« I once again urge congress to reconsider allowing Zachary Hudson another term as President of the Federation in light of Winters' ongoing, conspicuous, absence. »
