* Vadimo Patrons of Law Campaign Concludes

/04 May 3304/

The Vadimo Patrons of Law has announced that its campaign has received the unalloyed support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Sikorsky Station and by eliminating agitators in Vadimo, thereby protecting traders participating in the initiative. The delivered goods will be used to throw an elaborate party for the people of Vadimo. 

The Vadimo Patrons of Law has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Sikorsky Station in the Vadimo system.
