* Lave Radio Network Campaign Concludes

/15 Jun 3304/

The Lave Radio Network has announced that its campaign has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lave Station, thereby allowing the network to broadcast its annual conference to the entire galaxy. A rival campaign from the Lave Jet Family was unable to destabilise the Lave Radio initiative, despite also receiving the support of independent pilots. 

As the campaign drew to a close, one of the organisers released a statement: 

“The signal is spreading. We would like to extend our gratitude to the galactic community for making this possible.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lave Station in the Lave system.
