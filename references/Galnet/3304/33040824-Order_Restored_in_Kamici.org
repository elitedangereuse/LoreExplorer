* Order Restored in Kamici

/24 Aug 3304/

Kamici Incorporated has announced that its campaign to clear the Kamici system of felons has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in Kamici have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Gaiman Port in the Kamici system.
