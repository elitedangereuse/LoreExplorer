* Restoring Order in Wangal

/26 Jan 3304/

Authorities in the Wangal system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord. 

To counter this threat, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Nelder City. 

The campaign begins on the 25th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
