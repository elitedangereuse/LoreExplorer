* Simbad Regime Campaign

/19 Jan 3304/

The Simbad Regime was established over a year ago, and has enjoyed consistent growth with the support of Commanders across the galaxy. Now the group has announced plans to construct a new asteroid base among the rings of Nu Tauri 5. 

In support of this goal, the Simbad Regime has placed an open order for quantities of explosives, beryllium, aluminium and tea. 

A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement: 

“In order to secure the support of the galactic community, we are offering generous rewards to pilots who deliver materials to Parmitano Terminal in the Nu Tauri system.” 

The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
