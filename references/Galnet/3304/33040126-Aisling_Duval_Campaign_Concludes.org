/26 Jan 3304/

Representatives of Princess Aisling Duval have announced that the Princess’s anti-slavery campaign in the Guuguyni system has come to a successful conclusion. Hundreds of independent combat pilots supported the initiative, taking to their ships to neutralise the slave traders operating in the region. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Princess Duval released the following statement: 

“I am immeasurably grateful to those who supported this campaign. You have saved hundreds of people from a life of misery.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system.
