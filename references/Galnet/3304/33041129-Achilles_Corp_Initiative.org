* Achilles Corp Initiative

/29 Nov 3304/

The Achilles Corporation has announced plans to replace all robots destroyed as a result of the recent spy robot scandal. 

Chairman Gus Weaver of the Sol division of Achilles Corp said: 

“We take customer support seriously. That’s why we’re offering to replace – free of charge – any robots destroyed or damaged by owners who suspected them of behaving inappropriately.” 

“To achieve this, we’ve asked the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond to organise deliveries of robotics, computer components and microcontrollers to Henslow Market in the Adenets system. These will be used to produce brand new PA912 administration robots and other models.” 

“The Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond  has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities can do so safely. 

The initiative begins on the 29th of November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
