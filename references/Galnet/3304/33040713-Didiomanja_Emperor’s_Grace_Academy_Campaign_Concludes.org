* Didiomanja Emperor’s Grace Academy Campaign Concludes

/13 Jul 3304/

The Didiomanja Emperor’s Grace Academy has announced that its initiative has reached a successful conclusion. Large quantities of exotic food and drink, and mined resources, were delivered to Leydenfrost Dock over the past week, allowing the organisation to host a sumptuous banquet and construct a monument in honour of Admiral Mira Tiverion. 

A spokesperson for the Didiomanja Emperor’s Grace Academy released the following statement: 

“That was a banquet fit for an emperor. The food was sumptuous, the drink exquisite, and the revelry went on well into the early hours. I am certain Admiral Tiverion would have approved.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Leydenfrost Dock, in the Didiomanja system.
