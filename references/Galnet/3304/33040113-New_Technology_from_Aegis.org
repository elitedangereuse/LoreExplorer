* New Technology from Aegis

/13 Jan 3304/

Aegis has expanded its roster of anti-Thargoid technologies with a new device – the decontamination limpet. The device is specifically designed to counter the caustic properties of Thargoid missiles. 

In a statement, an Aegis spokesperson said: 

“As we know, the Thargoids’ enzyme missiles are particularly dangerous because of the caustic damage they inflict. The decontamination limpet is designed to address this by stripping the corrosive enzymes from a ship’s hull while also performing limited repairs.” 

“We have rigorously field tested the device and are confident that it will give pilots a distinct defensive advantage.” 

The decontamination limpet can be purchased from planetary bases with military, high-tech, refinery, industrial or extraction-level economies.
