* Salvage and Rescue Operation Ends

/25 May 3304/

The operation to recover survivors and salvage from a convoy that was attacked in the core systems has been brought to a halt. Search-and-rescue teams from United Carnoeck for Equality were assisted by scores of independent pilots. 

Security Chief Tal Woźniak thanked those who participated:  

“Many of the convoy’s crew members owe their lives to the Commanders who brought them to safety. We have also recovered data from the attack, which will help us track down and wipe out the pirate group responsible, hopefully before they massacre more innocents.” 

Pilots who contributed to the operation can now collect their rewards from Bacon City in the Carnoeck system.
