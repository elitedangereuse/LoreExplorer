* Utopia Campaign Concludes

/11 May 3304/

The Utopia campaign to construct a military installation in its home system has now concluded. Many traders delivered a huge quantity of construction material to Bobko City, which will be used to build defences for the Sim-Archive. Other independent pilots protected the operation by eliminating pirate vessels. 

Utopia’s spokesperson, Dr Leigh Constantinides, expressed her gratitude: 

“On behalf of Utopia, I would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to support this project. We hope that this will safeguard the Sim-Archive for the benefit of all our descendants.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Bobko City in the Narri system.
