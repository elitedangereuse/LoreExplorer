* HIP 17692 Operation Concludes

/19 Jan 3304/

Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the HIP 17692 system has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids in the system and by rescuing people from Thargoid attack sites. Those rescued during the operation are now recovering at Blackmount Orbital. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Denton Patreus released the following statement: 

“This campaign would not have succeeded without the support of the galaxy’s independent combat pilots, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude. Thanks are also due to the Merope Expeditionary Fleet and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise for coordinating the campaign. But while we may have won the battle, we still have a long way to go if we are to liberate our galaxy from this alien menace.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system.
