* Scandal Hits Rochester Family

/06 Sep 3304/

The famous actor Tomas Turai, husband of Jupiter Rochester, has been revealed to be having an extramarital affair with an Olympian athlete. 

An article in The Mars Tribune stated: 

“For the last three years, Tomas Turai has conducted a secret relationship with Reagan Lord, who has won several Olympic gold medals for the Altair system. Their romantic liaison took place without the knowledge of Turai’s husband, Jupiter Rochester, or their two children.” 

There has been no response from Jupiter Rochester. The Rochester family is currently in a media lockdown following the cancelled wedding of Ambassador Jordan Rochester and Princess Aisling Duval. 

But Tomas Turai and August Lord, husband of Reagan Lord, have both announced their intention to sue The Mars Tribune for defamation. The publication’s owner, billionaire Kingsley Cordova, has confirmed that he will personally cover all legal costs in contesting both civil actions. 

Lana Sigrid, chief editor of The Mars Tribune, published this comment: 

“We have an obligation to publish the truth wherever we find it. The detailed evidence we’ve obtained about Tomas Turai’s behaviour is beyond dispute. We employ the finest journalists in the Federation, and our soaring subscription figures prove we’ve earned the public’s trust.”
