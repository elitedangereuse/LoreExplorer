The Lave Jet Family has announced that its campaign to prevent the Lave Radio Network from broadcasting its annual conference has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to construct a signal jammer, thereby preventing Lave Radio from transmitting the conference. 

The Lave Jet Family has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lave Station in the Lave system.
