* Socho Operation Complete

/23 Mar 3304/

The operation to clear Socho of Thargoids has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoid vessels in the system, and by delivering alien material to Dantec Enterprise. 

A spokesperson for Aegis Core, which oversaw the initiative, made the following statement: 

“The pilots who took part in the operation have my thanks – they showed some real mettle. I can’t promise the material they delivered will lead to any momentous discoveries, but you never know.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.
