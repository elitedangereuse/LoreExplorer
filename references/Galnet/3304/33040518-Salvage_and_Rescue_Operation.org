* Salvage and Rescue Operation

/18 May 3304/

A convoy travelling through the core systems has come under attack from a pirate group, and local authorities are requesting assistance in finding survivors. 

The operation is being coordinated by Security Chief Tal Woźniak of United Carnoeck for Equality, who made this announcement: 

“The convoy came under intense fire from pirates, with many ships damaged or destroyed. We immediately dispatched search-and-rescue teams, but the volume of debris is significant, and we are therefore requesting help from any independent pilots in the area.” 

“Our priority is to locate survivors, but we’re also keen to acquire data that might help to bring those responsible to justice.” 

Pilots are requested to recover Occupied Escape Pods, Black Boxes and Wreckage Components, and deliver them to Bacon City in the Carnoeck system. 

The campaign begins on the 17th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
