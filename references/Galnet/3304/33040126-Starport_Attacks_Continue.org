* Starport Attacks Continue

/26 Jan 3304/

Two further starports have fallen prey to Thargoid attack: Kipling Orbital in the Pleiades Sector KC-V C2-11 and Malthus Terminal in the Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41. 

As with previous Thargoid assaults, the attacks have caused significant damage and resulted in huge numbers of casualties. 

A member of starport personnel at Kipling Orbital offered the following: 

“It seems the Thargoids are sweeping the region, moving slowly in the direction of the core systems. But why?” 

Authorities in the affected systems have issued requests for help, imploring independent pilots to deliver aid and evacuate civilians.
