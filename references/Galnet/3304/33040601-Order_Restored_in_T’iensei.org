* Order Restored in T’iensei

/01 Jun 3304/

The Autocracy of T’iensei has announced that its campaign to clear the T’iensei system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in T’iensei have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dzhanibekov Port in the T’iensei system.
