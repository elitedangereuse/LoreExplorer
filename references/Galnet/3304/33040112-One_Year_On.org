* One Year On

/12 Jan 3304/

It has now been a year since the Thargoids returned to human-occupied space, and in that time they have become increasingly aggressive, their hostility culminating in starport attacks in the Pleiades Nebula. 

Now that the Thargoids’ intentions have been made clear, the question many are asking is “what can we do?” 

Outspoken political commentator Daxton Sung offered the following analysis: 

“The situation continues to escalate and our leaders continue to offer the same tired platitudes – militaristic bombast from Hudson, noncommittal banalities from Lavigny-Duval and earnest sympathising from Mahon. It’s clear that they have no idea how to counter the Thargoid threat, beyond pumping more money into Aegis’s weapons programme.”
