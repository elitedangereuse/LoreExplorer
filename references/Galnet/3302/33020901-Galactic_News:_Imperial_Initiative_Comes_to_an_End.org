* Galactic News: Imperial Initiative Comes to an End

/01 Sep 3302/

Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the Imperial appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. A spokesperson for the Morai Nobles, which helped to coordinate the campaign, confirmed that scores of Imperial pilots supported the initiative to construct three new Majestic-class Interdictors by delivering supplies to van de Hulst Vision in the Morai system. 

As the campaign concluded, Admiral Patreus issued a statement: 

"Once again, the galaxy's Imperial pilots have shown themselves to be industrious and resourceful.  

It is individuals like you who make the Empire what it is." 

"Construction of the new ships will begin at once." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from de Hulst Vision.
