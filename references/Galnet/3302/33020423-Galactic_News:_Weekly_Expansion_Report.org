* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/23 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Aapelinja Silver Vision Inc 

Canary Mining Corporation 

Uniting HIP 103438 

LHS 1505 Life Ltd 

HIP 18725 Purple Allied Industry 

Liberate Ceos 

Corin Jet State Corporation 

LPM 752 Industries 

Progressive Party of GD 140 

UGP 64 Jet Travel and Co 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
