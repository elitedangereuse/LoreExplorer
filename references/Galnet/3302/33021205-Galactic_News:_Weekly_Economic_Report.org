* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/05 Dec 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Social Zaragas Independents 

Brani Federal Holdings 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

Yakabugai Exchange 

Ruchbah Industry 

Kokary Holdings	 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Delphin Blue Federal PLC3 

Panoi Holdings 

Ross 754 Universal and Co 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel 

HIP 118311 Posse 

Atroan Gold Gang 

Velnambang Rats 

LHS 4031 Ring 

People's Isiti for Equality 

Balanek Gold Society 

HIP 1572 Limited 

Lopocareni United 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
