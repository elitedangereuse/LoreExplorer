* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/18 Jun 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Black Omega 

Raven's Scouts 

Nidarijedi Empire Party 

Arakapajo Empire Party 

Barons of Rianik 

Hrana General Holdings 

Independent Cerni Free 

Er Tche Confederation 

Nahundi Galactic and Co 

Brazilian League of Pilots 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Apathaam Patron's Principles 

64 Arietis Crimson Partnership 

Wolf 324 Exchange 

Reign Of Annihilation 

Iota Hydri Empire Pact 

New Wikatabar Green Party 

Order of Airsetanoa 

Tetekhe Inc 

Noblemen of Wadjarata 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
