* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/10 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Natural LP 811-17 Conservatives 

New Xhosag Democrats	 

Matia Crimson Allied Industries 

New Potriambunn Resistance 

Liberty Party of Theta Indi 

New Siddha Constitution Party 

Coriccha Silver Organisation 

Synteini Partners 

Law Party of Mara 

Defence Party of NLTT 57668 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Chamunda Crimson Travel Exchange 

Lambda Hydri Industry 

LTT 6714 Company 

LHS 538 Corporation 

Lords of the DarkStar Imperium 

League of Khruvandji Conservatives 

Hand Gang of Apoya 

Aulin Silver United Company 

Hojin Blue Dragons 

Aditi Jet Mafia 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
