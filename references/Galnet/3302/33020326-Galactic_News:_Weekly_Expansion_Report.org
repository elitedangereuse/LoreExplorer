* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/26 Mar 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Shongbon Comms Systems 

Children of Raxxla 

Alliance of Totjob'al 

Wargis Citizens' Forum 

LHS 2771 Party 

Baka'wa Partnership 

Wolf 980 Purple Crew 

Future of 12 Persei 

Anna Perenna Industries 

LHS 191 Values Party 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
