* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/17 Dec 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 114044 Empire Group 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Jaques 

Revolutionary Abazates Democrats 

Chi Eridani Crimson Travel and Co 

New Arnemil Liberals 

Xhosag Imperial Society 

Monoto Commodities

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Independents of Mildeptu 

Gitxsan Limited 

Autocracy of Phi Gruis 

Ambivas Power Partners 

LHS 3598 Transport Group 

Regulatory State of Kausan 

Smethells 119 Front 

LTT 700 Jet Major Holdings 

Baraswar Crimson Vision Ltd 

Wolf 294 Industry 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
