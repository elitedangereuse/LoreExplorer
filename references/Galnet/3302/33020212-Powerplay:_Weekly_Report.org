* Powerplay: Weekly Report

/12 Feb 3302/

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon signed no trade agreements this week, as negotiations with delegates from Ross 842 and HIP 55118 failed to produce satisfactory terms for all stakeholders. New trade agreements with Mong Kung and Picunche are currently being negotiated. 

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters secured support from the Sawali system this week, bringing the total number of systems under her control to 68. Ch'iang Fei declined to formally pledge support to the Liberal party. Attempts to secure the support of the Amuzgo and Chukchan systems through focused aid packages are currently in progress. 

Federal President Zachary Hudson was faced with resource shortfalls this week, resulting in the abandonment of military operations in Carpaka and LPM 229. President Hudson is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a military presence in the Concantae system, but supply shortages threaten the long-term viability of the Federal fleet in Bandjigali. If supplies remain low, the expansion into Concantae may fail, and Federal fleets may withdraw from Bandjigali. 

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval encountered supply chain difficulties this week, preventing the Shield of Justice from establishing a presence in Waimiri. The combat readiness of Shield of Justice patrols has been jeopardized in Damoorai, Olelbis and Kappa, and could lead to withdrawal from these systems. If the shortages are resolved, Bragur, Mbutsi, Hrun, Brestla, Kherthaje and HR 4720 could be patrolled by the Emperor's fleets next week. 

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui approved new Sirius franchises in Hyldeptu this week, bringing the total number of systems in the Sirius portfolio to 55. Business deals are underway in Polecteri and San, and early negotiations have begun in HIP 2778. Things looks good for Sirius. 

Princess Aisling Duval's publicity teams unleashed an impressive media blitz this week, spending roughly 8 billion credits to spread the message of the People's Princess. As a result, the citizens of HIP 77470 have expressed interest in supporting Aisling's agenda, which would make HIP 77470 the 63rd system to support the princess's cause. 

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval's enterprises are currently well-funded, and the senator is looking into purchasing infrastructure in V2689 Orionis and HR 6948. Both systems could provide unique employment and trading opportunities deep within Federal territory. 

Simguru Pranav Antal was unable to secure Taosha and Sukree this week. Violent protests have erupted in HIP 7076 and Gendini, as Utopian agitators attempt to liberate the systems' citizens from the misguided bureaucrats who resist the truth of Utopia. 

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus secured harbour for his fleets in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini this week, securing the independent system against future incursions from the Kumo Crew, which attacked the system mere weeks ago. Senator Patreus is also seeking harbour for his fleets in the Contie system, where he recently concluded a sale of arms. 

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine crushed rebellions in Yuror and Itzanmets, ensuring both systems remained firmly in his grasp. Turmoil within the Kumo Crew has abated, and signs of Kumo Crew activity are already beginning to appear in systems near the borders of the Pirate Lord's domain. Should this activity persist, insurrections could soon take place in Morronii and HIP 111880.
