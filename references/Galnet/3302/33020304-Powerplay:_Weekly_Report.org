* Powerplay: Weekly Report

/04 Mar 3302/

This weekly report summarises the recent actions of the galaxy's movers and shakers in Federal, Imperial, Alliance and Independent spheres of influence. 

The Federation 

Last week was a sweeping success for the Federation. Fleets under the command of President Zachary Hudson exerted massive efforts in Adan, Carpaka, Concantae and LPM 229, successfully establishing a semi-permanent presence in all but Adan. Shadow President Felicia Winters finally claimed new supporters in Amuzgo, a system with which she has repeatedly attempted to curry favour, but her bid to secure support in the hotly contested DR Crucis system was not successful. 

The Empire 

The Empire suffered a number of setbacks this week, mostly stemming from the increased Federal presence in Carpaka, Concantae, LPM 229 and Amuzgo. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's influence in dozens of systems diminished as a result of these Federal expansions. Princess Aisling Duval's public relations campaigns in Chnumar and Madngela failed to draw more supporters to her cause, even as the Conii system withdrew its support. Senator Zemina Torval focused on protecting her investments and made no new acquisitions. Senator Denton Patreus's fleets were rebuffed in Neali and HIP 116377, but successfully established a presence in HIP 2239. 

The Alliance 

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon led the Alliance through another week of relative calm. With last week's dispute in DR Crucis now resolved, Alliance negotiators are taking the first steps to secure a trade agreement with that system. 

Independents 

The acquisition of the valuable Polecteri system by Sirius Gov, led by CEO Li Yong-Rui, was the highlight of Independent activity this week. A bold attempt from Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew to overthrow LTT 874 was repulsed by Imperial fleets, but the level of criminal activity in the system remained high. Pranav Antal's Utopia focused on establishing an influence in Sukree and Yemotepa, which are currently the site of violent protests incited by Utopian agitators.
