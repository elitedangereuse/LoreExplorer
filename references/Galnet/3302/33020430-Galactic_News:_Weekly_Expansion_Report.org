* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/30 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Belianses Silver Partnership 

Allowa Vision and Co 

Nuwach Labour 

Igalalani Independent Consulate 

Movement for Howard Partnership 

Gandui Incorporated 

LP 387-31 allied 

Ferenchia Purple Dynamic Corp 

Rotanev Energy Exchange 

Findja Empire Assembly 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
