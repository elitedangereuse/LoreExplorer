/30 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Crystal Armada 

Aditi Crimson Energy Inc 

LTT 874 Purple Clan 

14 i Orionis Jet Camorra	Independent 

Mafia of Hou Mayo 

Lords of Feng Du 

Tsohoda Gold Mafia 

Kamocan Crimson Central Network 

Party of Mehuenomici 

Igal Electronics Inc 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
