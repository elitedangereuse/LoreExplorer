* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/16 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Malibata Purple Bridge Comms 

Confederacy of Mandubii 

Nagarans League 

Guardians of Harmony 

LHS 304 Crimson Dynamic Co 

HIP 58213 Co-operative 

Keliuona Patron's Principles 

Bodhinga Empire Assembly 

Silver Life Co 

Uniting Qamadi 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
