* Community Goal: Aid for D'Arrest Station

/17 Nov 3302/

In February this year, Princess Aisling Duval established a repatriation centre for former slaves at D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. Since then the centre has gone from strength to strength, successfully emancipating thousands of slaves and rescuing hundreds from the horrors of illegal slavery. 

When the initiative launched, many of Princess Aisling's detractors dismissed it as a publicity stunt, but her ongoing commitment to the centre has silenced even her most ardent critics. It is understood that she receives daily updates from D'Arrest Station, and makes personal visits once a month. 

It therefore comes as little surprise that, following news of an outbreak at the starport, Princess Aisling has secured funding for a relief effort. In a statement, the princess expressed concern for those affected: 

"It is extremely important that the unfortunate people at D'Arrest Station receive help as soon as possible, and I implore the galactic community to come to their aid. The Uibuth Empire Party has graciously offered to coordinate the relief effort." 

The Uibuth Empire Party has promised to reward pilots who deliver basic medicines to D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. The campaign begins on the 17th of November and will run for one week. If targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
