* Community Goal: Morrina in Need

/28 Apr 3302/

The people of the Morrina system have endured considerable hardship recently, first at the hand of criminal gangs and then as a result of widespread civil unrest. Although a recent military operation succeeded in eliminating the agitators operating in the system, much of Morrina has been badly affected by the conflict, and many citizens are suffering from a lack of water and power. 

In response to this, the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has launched an appeal for essential supplies in order to undo the damage caused by the extended conflict. The organisation has placed an open order for basic medicines, water purifiers and power generators, and has promised to generously reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Beaumont Dock. 

Organisation spokespersons Commander Saool and Commander Dennehy released the following statement: 

"For the past month, the Morrina system has been embroiled in conflict. The galactic community stepped up to help cull the criminal elements ravaging the system, and the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has started to repair planetary infrastructure and restore power to the night side of tidally locked Morrina 3. But we need more supplies to get the system back on its feet." 

The campaign begins on the 28th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
