* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/30 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Ernueken Future 

LP 510-10 Solutions 

Holiacan Dynamic Company 

Confederacy of Pan 

LHS 221 Vision Systems 

Hayimshis Noblement 

Black Hand of Jaaka 

Kamocadroa Purple Comms Systems 

Friends of Concateneg 

Tsanla Empire Party 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

La Rochelle Blue Netcoms Co 

Official Bragpura Defence Party 

Ninmah and Co 

Eototari Resistance 

HR 4734 Progressive Party 

Yen Di Travel Inc 

Grovichun Gold Netcoms Inc 

Social Akbulun for Equality 

Turna Confederation 

LHS 1918 Major Exchange 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
