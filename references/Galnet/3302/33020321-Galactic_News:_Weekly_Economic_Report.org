* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/21 Mar 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party 

Etznabi Freedom Party 

Lambda-2 Tucanae Empire League 

Republic Party of Votama 

Social Ross 346 Coalition 

Albast Group 

Sleipnera Nobles 

League of CD-36 1535 Justice Party 

Dierites Gold Comms Corp. 

Movement for Ba Xian League 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Revolutionary Party of Wapiya 

Natural Vega Liberty Party 

LTT 7421 Rats 

Tzeltal Blue Creative Systems 

Liberals of Jumukulayon	 

People's Kehperi People's Party 

Arouca Focus 

Defence Party of Lave 

Tarach Tor Organisation	 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
