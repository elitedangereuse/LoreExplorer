* Galactic News: Alliance Campaign Concludes

/27 Oct 3302/

A spokesperson for the 160 SOAR has announced that the Alliance appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. 

Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Tshang City, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to construct an outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4. 

In a statement, the spokesperson said: 

"We are immeasurably grateful to the galactic community for its support. The outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4 will serve as a base for research into the barnacles, allowing us to further our understanding of these fascinating structures. Construction will begin in a matter of weeks." 

But the campaign has not been without controversy, with some asserting that the outpost represents an attempt to claim ownership of the organic structures on California Sector BA-A E6 4. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.
