* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/21 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Social Zaragas Independents

LTT 377 Purple General Corp. 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Kokary Holdings	 

Ruchbah Industry

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

i Bootis Central Limited 

HIP 1114 Progressive Party 

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel 

Flesk Transport Organisation 

HIP 118311 Posse 

LTT 537 Future 

Drug Empire of Caeresi 

Lambda-1 Tucanae Progressive Party 

Velnambang Rats 

Salibi Mafia 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
