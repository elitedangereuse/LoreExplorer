* Galactic News: Bentonio's Request Rebuffed

/13 May 3302/

Arlo Cortez, a member of Jasmina Halsey's personal staff, has responded to a recent statement from Ricardo Bentonio, the notorious conspiracy theorist. In an official press release, Cortez said: 

"The suggestion that Jasmina has been somehow 'silenced' by oppressive governmental powers is patently ridiculous. The decision to admit Jasmina to the Clearwater Clinic was made by her friends and family. No one else was involved." 

Cortez also said that Bentonio's request to meet with Halsey would not be granted: 

"Our paramount concern is that Jasmina receives the care and attention she needs. She will not be meeting with members of the press, representatives of the Federation, or crackpot conspiracy theorists."
