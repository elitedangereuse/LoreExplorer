* Galactic News: Loren Trial Begins

/26 Oct 3302/

The trial of Lady Kahina Tijani Loren has begun at the Prism Hall of Justice. 

Earlier this week, several flotillas of heavily armed ships arrived in the Prism system. The vessels docked at the Hiram's Anchorage starport amid tight security enforced by Imperial forces and local organisation Loren's Legion, which controls the Prism system. 

Much of Hiram's Anchorage has been off limits to civilians during the week because of fears that Loren's presence, and that of Admiral Denton Patreus, would lead to renewed instability. Loren's return to her home system is controversial in itself, as she has not been there since she ceded executive power to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney. 

Loren was briefly seen in conversation with Ambassador Delaney, who embraced Loren before she was moved to a secure holding area. Admiral Patreus arrived a few hours later. Media representatives have not been allowed to speak to either Loren or Patreus, and it is understood that the trial will be conducted behind closed doors. 

The mood in Prism is sombre. Support for Loren is muted, with few willing to publically support her ahead of the trial. But it is clear there is little enthusiasm for Admiral Patreus, either.
