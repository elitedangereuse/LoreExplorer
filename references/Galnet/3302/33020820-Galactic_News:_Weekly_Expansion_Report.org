* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/20 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Lundji Major Corporation 

Earls of LHS 283 

Byel Tan Jet United Corp. 

Canary Mining Corporation 

Nidarijedi Empire Party 

Traditional Velliep Justice Party 

Ch'anjie Netcoms Commodities 

Gabri Labour 

Wolf 1414 Nobles 

Tomani Blue State Co 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

New Wolf 248 Independents 

Chinicollo League 

Paletes Order 

Social Mombawet Revolutionary Party 

Confederacy of Mandubii 

Nisgayo for Equality 

United LHS 1101 for Equality 

Vetta Bureau 

Official Huano Regulatory State 

Negidals Co 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
