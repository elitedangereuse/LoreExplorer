* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/11 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Independents of Mildeptu 

Workers of TZ Arietis Democrats 

LHS 3516 Fortune Company 

Ndjabog Purple Comms Solutions 

NLTT 7856 Imperial Society 

LTT 2963 Crimson Vision PLC 

Nocori Progressive Party 

Green Party of Ross 302 

Alliance Office of Statistics 

Opala Power Commodities 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Kamadhenu Partners 

Drug Empire of HIP 78866 

TaexaliTemu Empire Group 

Worker's Party of Kemurukamar 

Nationals of Seurbi 

Freedom Party of Kala 

Thosiao Republic Party 

HIP 60953 Jet Clan 

Wolf 906 Gold Ring 

Monarchy of GCRV 54903 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
