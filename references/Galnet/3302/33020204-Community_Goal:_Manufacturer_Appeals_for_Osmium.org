* Community Goal: Manufacturer Appeals for Osmium

/04 Feb 3302/

The LHS 2936 Alliance Combine, a manufacturing concern based in the LHS 2936 system, has issued a galaxy-wide request for osmium. According to a company spokesperson, the rare metal will be used to create specialist alloys with which to improve the organisation's manufacturing facilities. The organisation has promised to reward contributors with discounts at the Fraser Orbital shipyard in addition to liberal financial reimbursements. 

The company's spokesperson gave a statement to the media: 

"It is no secret that our share price dipped recently, but we are confident that with the requisite materials we will be able to regain our competitive edge. That's why we're offering generous incentives to pilots who deliver osmium to our base of operations at Fraser Orbital." 

The campaign begins today and is expected to run for one week.
