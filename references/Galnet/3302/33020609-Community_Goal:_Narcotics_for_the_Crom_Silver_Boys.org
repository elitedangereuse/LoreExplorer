* Community Goal: Narcotics for the Crom Silver Boys

/09 Jun 3302/

Those who have explored the trade routes of Wolf 1301 will undoubtedly recall 'wolf fesh', the popular psychoactive drug that was once produced in the system. Although originally legal, when control of the system changed last year the drug was banned, and production was immediately halted. Wolf fesh disappeared from galactic trade routes almost overnight. 

But now it seems that the drug is about to make a return. Notorious crime syndicate the Crom Silver Boys, known for targeting traders and miners from their secret base in the Crom system, claim to have procured the secret recipe for the drug, and have announced plans to produce a new variant. 

The organisation has already stockpiled the necessary common ingredients, but to begin production it needs a quantity of rarer elements found only in other narcotics. The Crom Silver Boys have therefore placed an open order for the requisite intoxicants, and have promised to reward those who deliver the much-needed goods to Walheim Enterprise in the Herthe system. 

Most of the requested commodities are illegal in Herthe, and the system's security forces have vowed to interdict and search any suspicious vessels. The Crom Silver Boys have advised pilots participating in the operation to exercise caution. 

The campaign begins on the 9th of June 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
