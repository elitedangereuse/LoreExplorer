* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/19 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Official Darkates Freedom 

Sol Workers' Party 

Labour of Geras	 

Modgud Commodities 

Ambivas Power Partners 

HIP 114530 Guardians 

Partnership of Nitikaba 

Betel Free 

Sui Xenates Indie Union 

Jaques 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Labour of Ethgreze 

Independents of Mildeptu 

The Pilots Federation 

Zugen Incorporated 

LP 811-17 Gold Energy Partners 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

Yhele Guardians of Tradition 

HIP 28987 Empire Pact 

Codorain Network 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
