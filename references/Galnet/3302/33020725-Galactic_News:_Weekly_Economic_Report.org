* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/25 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Aymifa Resistance 

New Siddha Constitution Party 

Lokitaka Mu Silver Universal Net 

Labour of Kalads 

Chi Eridani Crimson Travel and Co 

Noblemen of Lao Gobe 

Kuruntabal Brothers 

Union of Djabushis Alliance 

Liberty Party of Chorathia 

Independents of HIP 105391 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Liabeze Legal Organisation 

Revolutionary HIP 599 Independents 

Asellus Primus Purple Crew 

Bureau of 45 Tauri League 

Independent 

LTT 198 Order 

Eurybia Blue Mafia 

Union of Chup Kamui Green Party 

Namniez Free 

Ross 209 Fortune Organisation 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
