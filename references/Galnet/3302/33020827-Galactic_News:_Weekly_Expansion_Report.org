* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/27 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Kamarada Jet Legal Services 

Tollan Free 

Wuluwait Fortune Commodities 

Epsilon Phoenicis Principles 

Yuinni Worker's Party 

Hatis Silver Brothers 

HIP 19408 Monarchy 

Brutas Crimson Netcoms Corp. 

Official GCRV 52424 Defence Force 

Machadan Alliance 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Aymiay Values Party 

Confederacy of Yamahun 

Alliance of CD-33 8748 

HIP 24968 Empire Consulate 

Partnership of Kaupatak	 

HIP 106213 Jet Power Services 

Fular Purple State Corp. 

Union of BD+14 611 Partnership 

Dukes of Kachakapa 

Union of LTT 2240 Democrats 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
