* Galactic News: Order Restored to Graill Redd

/07 Jul 3302/

The Graill Redd Liberals have announced that their campaign to clear the Graill Redd system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the communists operating in the system. 

Authorities in the Graill Redd system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at J. G. Ballard Gateway.
