/24 Nov 3302/

The Uibuth Empire Party has announced that its appeal for basic medicines has received the unconditional support of the galactic community. Over the past week, huge quantities of medication have been delivered to D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system, which will be used to control the outbreak currently plaguing the starport. 

Princess Aisling Duval, who funded the relief effort and whose repatriation centre is based at the starport, released a brief statement: 

"I would like to extend my most sincere gratitude to those who supported this campaign. Medical personnel at D'Arrest Station have assured me that the situation will soon be in hand." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from D'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system.
