* Freelance Report: Explorers Contribute to Mapping Project

/24 Apr 3302/

For several weeks, explorers have been gathering at the Institute of Galactic Exploration and Research at Kippax Ring in the HIP 72043 system. The system has become a hub for explorers contributing to the Sagittarius-Carina Mission, a project to chart the Sagittarius-Carina Arm from its root at the galactic core to its tip at the galactic rim. 

Organised by the First Great Expedition, the mission is open to all pilots â€“ the only requirement being that they own a ship and can dare to dream. 

"We have a strong support network, an amazing list of places to visit, and vast regions of uncharted territory to explore. What we don't have is a schedule. Anyone can jump in any time, at any stage of the journey," said one member of the FGE.
