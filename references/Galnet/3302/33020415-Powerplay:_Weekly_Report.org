* Powerplay: Weekly Report

/15 Apr 3302/

The Powerplay weekly report summarises the activities of the galaxy's movers and shakers in the Federation, the Empire, the Alliance and Independent spheres of influence during the previous week. 

The Federation: 

The Federal Navy's garrison supply shortage was ended this week, preventing the need to abandon another base in Phra Mool. Federal President Zachary Hudson is currently receiving intelligence reports from a number of systems, and will decide where to focus the efforts of the Federal Navy by the end of the week. 

Shadow President Winters claimed the full support of residents in the Puntin system this week, bringing the number of systems under her direct control to 70. Federal Aid transports are currently attempting to showcase the merits of Federal health and welfare programmes in HIP 50489 and Kappa. 

The Empire: 

Ao Kax descended into turmoil this week, jeopardizing Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's hold on the system. If she is able to allocate sufficient supplies to garrison the Shield of Justice and restore order, HR 4720 may join her cause. 

Princess Aisling Duval claimed support from citizens in Blod and HIP 95256, swelling Aisling's support base to 60 systems. The People's Princess is currently dispatching sealed contracts to the Conii system. 

Senator Zemina Torval finalized the purchase of assets in HR 6948, but deals to acquire matching assets in Grudi fell through. Torval currently has her sights set on Bandjigali, Candecama and VVO 19. 

Senator Denton Patreus, the Admiral of the Imperial Fleet, was rebuffed in his efforts to stage his fleets in Medzistha and Mula Wendes. Patreus's fleets are currently staged in LFT 142, Menero Kimi and V374 Pegasi. 

The Alliance: 

Alliance bureaucrats busily collected an unprecedented quantity of briefings and status reports from preferred trading systems. The blockades put in place by Federation-aligned corporations forced 12 systems to rescind their trade agreements with the Alliance. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is reportedly attempting to re-establish relations with these beleaguered systems. A total of 86 systems remain in the Alliance trade network. 

Independents: 

No systems changed hands among the independent powers this week, but each power is preparing to make bold moves in the coming week. 

SiriusGov CEO Li Yong-Rui is attempting to purchase huge swathes of private and government assets in Chang O. 

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine was unable to secure new strongholds in Mikunn and Latugara, and no new insurrections have been spotted. 

Simguru Pranav Antal is attempting to expand the reach of Utopia to Allowa, Anouphis, Antanyamai, FS 34, LP 708-253, Maia and Renpetani. Should all of these systems become a part of Utopia, their enclaves will be present in 55 systems.
