* Freelance Report: Happy Canonn Day!

/27 Apr 3302/

Dr Arcanonn, head of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has been released a statement to the media: 

"A year ago today, I inadvertently started what is now known as a paragon of independent science: the Canonn Interstellar Research Group." 

"Since then, my colleagues and our associates have led the way in Unknown Artefact research: discovering and decoding the Artefacts' Morse code signal, identifying the UA 'shell' around the Merope system in the Pleiades, and, more recently, researching the barnacles discovered on five planets in the Pleiades â€“ work that still continues, with new barnacles being found every week." 

"I think the next year will see us answer some of the outstanding questions, but also uncover more mysteries. If so, you can be certain we will be there, working from our lab in Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43, and lifting the veil for the rest of humanity."
