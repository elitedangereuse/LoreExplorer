* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/26 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

HIP 112052 Central Corporation	 

Branglal PLC 

Leschanatya Future 

Future of LTT 911 

Ngun Patron's Principles 

Coalition of Djagana 

Yhele Empire Party 

HIP 29964 Patrons of Law 

Sokaram Citizens of Tradition 

Gliese 9106 Partners 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Labour of Ethgreze 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

39 Tauri Interstellar 

Gitxsan Limited 

Momotaro Silver State PLC 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

Nasaraudi Jet Mob 

Bodb Dearg Order 

Social LHS 449 Partnership 

LHS 199 Guardians of Tradition 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
