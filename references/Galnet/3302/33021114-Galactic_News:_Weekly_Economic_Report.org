* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/14 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Social Zaragas Independents 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Official Darkates Freedom Party	 

Cemiess Commodities 

Kokary Holdings	 

Eravate Network 

Panoi Holdings 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

HIP 8593 Empire League 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

HIP 1114 Progressive Party 

LTT 537 Future 

Drug Empire of Caeresi 

Salibi Mafia 

Rautandji Gold Partnership 

Qetesh Dynamic Commodities 

Eshu Gold Mafia 

Workers of Sif Citizen Party 

Jalai Resistance 

Hania Jet Raiders 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
