* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/31 Dec 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Branglal PLC 

Bodb Dearg Order 

Sesmu Incorporated 

Ahayus Syndicate 

Any Kutjara Legal Incorporated 

Djinaura Brotherhood 

Mbayame Domain 

Quiness Crimson Legal Solutions

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Ross 754 Labour 

i Bootis Democrats 

Workers of TZ Arietis Democrats 

Confederation of Dahan 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Leaders of LFT 1404 

Aisoci Empire League 

Movement for Tobarci Confederacy 

Allied Lacabil Conservatives 

HIP 113010 Empire Assembly 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
