* Galactic News: Weekly Powers Update Incoming

/24 Feb 3302/

In the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT), the GalNet monitoring of powers' activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled. 

Any pilots who operate for one of the powers must deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time to ensure their activities are registered.
