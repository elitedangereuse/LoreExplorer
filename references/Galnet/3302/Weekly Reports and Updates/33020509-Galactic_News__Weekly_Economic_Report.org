* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/09 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Ross 490 Blue Public Corp. 

Yhele Guardians of Tradition

Tian Xian Inc 

Xhosag General Corporation

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Cayutorme for Equality 

CD-63 201 Travel Solutions 

Paladin Consortium 

Metzili Autocracy 

64 Arietis Jet General Solutions 

Order of Njorog 

Njorog Jet Dynamic Industry 

LTT 9577 Crimson Clan 

WISE 1800+0134 Jet Partnership 

Posse of Polevnic 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
