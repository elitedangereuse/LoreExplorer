* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/07 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Workers of Velim People's Party	 

Sirius Inc 

HIP 95256 Party 

Yen Ek Empire League 

Democrats of Muth 

Progressive Party of Alacarakmo 

Jaroere Exchange 

Ngobriglai Services 

Gorringa Crimson Advanced and Co 

Mufrid Fortune Interstellar 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
