* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/13 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

El Confederation 

Lacaille 8760 Allied Corp. 

Himardisc Bureau 

Confederation of Dewindji 

Epsilon Hydri Commodities 

Natural Carnai Party 

Progressive Party of Sagara 

Social Oresqu Resistance 

Mapocori Holdings 

Confederation of Chapoyo 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Inupinie Jet Life PLC 

Albisaki Prison Colony 

Paesia Future 

Mechtanitou Empire Party 

Bhaguti Advanced Corporation 

Progressive Party of Wolf 433 

Lambayeque Corporation 

Luhman 16 Central and Co 

Dangarla Creative Corp.	 

Liberals of LTT 606 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
