* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/25 Jun 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Gliese 58 Inc 

Varangian Syndicate 

Chontaiko Purple Central Prtnrs 

Values Party of 16 Persei 

LTT 1798 Incorporated 

Parana United Commodities 

Dedalo Corp. Interstellar 

Independent Kongi League

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

EG Union 

Magn Allied Interstellar 

Social Shotep Worker's Party 

Narasimha Silver Raiders 

Bureau of Ross 209 

Green Party of Pataheimr 

United 6 Andromedae Democrats 

People's Blati Coalition 

Pixel Bandits Security Force 

Liberals of Wolf 871 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
