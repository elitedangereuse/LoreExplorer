* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/17 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Vanayequi Independents 

Federal Congress 

Annarr Dynamic Corp. 

LTT 874 Empire Assembly 

Hu Jona Natural Systems 

Jeterait Bridge Interstellar 

Beta-1 Tucanae Empire Consulate 

Futhark Empire Assembly

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Ryder Revolutionary Party 

Hojin Blue Dragons 

LTT 1345 Gold Energy Inc 

Aditi Jet Universal Interstellar 

Aditi Crimson Energy Inc 

V2151 Cygni Independents 

Allied Tauernonese Dominion 

Kremainn First 

Yembo Blue Clan 

Apoyota Alliance 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
