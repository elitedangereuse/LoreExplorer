* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/03 Dec 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

HIP 96289 Blue Major Inc 

Fawaol Patrons of Law 

HIP 112052 Central Corporation	 

Ngakwites Empire Consulate 

Sotidji Purple Power Ltd 

Li Quang Confederation	 

Bodharail Empire Party 

CD-44 10336 Industries 

Cailli Co-operative 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Ross 754 Labour 

Union of Delta Phoenicis Revolutionary Party 

BD+07 4267 Gold General PLC 

Independents of LHS 3262 

Workers of TZ Arietis Democrats 

HIP 114044 Empire Group 

LHS 3516 Fortune Company 

Anduliga Empire Group 

Ngadjal Citizens' Forum 

Yamatzicni Ltd 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
