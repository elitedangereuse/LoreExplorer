* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/05 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Independents of Mildeptu 

Zugen Incorporated 

HIP 112052 Central Corporation 

Zeus Bureau 

HIP 114530 Guardians 

Confederation of Dahan	 

Peng Dung Jet Creative Network 

Independent 

Eravapa Empire Group 

Jaques 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Eranin Peoples Party 

The Pilots Federation 

LHS 3505 Crimson Mafia1 

Nasaraudi Jet Mob 

Lao Zi Blue Fortune Corp. 

Anduliga Empire Group 

Allied Herthans Front 

HIP 1003 Nobles 

Priva Empire Group 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
