* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/08 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Panoi Holdings 

Zaragas Energy Corp. 

Blue Natural Holdings 

Yaroklis Industry 

HIP 106213 Independents 

Allied Kui Xenab Regulatory State 

Jeterait Bridge Interstellar 

Futhark Empire Assembly 

Eta Horologii Principles 

Epsilon Phoenicis Principles 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Koar Silver Syndicate 

Drug Empire of Karakamane 

Comanga Crimson Crew 

Mu Gong Silver Rats 

Chokota Future 

Holiacan Dynamic Company 

Chnumar Crimson Posse 

LTT 2771 as one	 

Aisling's Angels 

Social Tarach Tor Union Party 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
