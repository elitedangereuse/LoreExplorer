* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/15 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Chimba Public Industries 

Ross 210 Pro-Alliance Party 

Hu Jona Natural Systems 

Matia Future 

Amphisatsu Empire Group 

Bactondinks Patron's Principles 

Ho Hsien Legal Group

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

LHS 3447 Cartel 

Clan of Liv 

Family of Wira 

Labour of Velnambe 

Nobles of HIP 10716 

League of 51 Aquilae Dominion 

HIP 5488 Syndicate 

Sarahath Dragons 

Cashibo Industry 

Raiders of Quile 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
