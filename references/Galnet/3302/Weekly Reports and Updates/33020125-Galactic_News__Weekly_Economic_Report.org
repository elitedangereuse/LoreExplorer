* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/25 Jan 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 12,177 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Chi Herculis Creative Group 

HIP 62249 Allied Limited 

66 Draconis Incorporated 

Maurr Monarchy 

Worker's Party of HIP 38235 

Monarchy of Treima 

Laturesingo Empire Group 

HIP 112441 Services 

Rio Paha State Group 

Bestia General Organisation 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 610 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

LTT 5455 Jet Clan 

League of George Pantazis Defence Force 

Sha Gigas Ltd 

Dragons of Urvane 

Future of Zeta Fornacis 

HIP 18527 Liberty Party 

V1581 Cygni Gold Rats 

Kruger 60 and Co 

LHS 215 Purple Galactic Ind 

Cordenet Jet Ring 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
