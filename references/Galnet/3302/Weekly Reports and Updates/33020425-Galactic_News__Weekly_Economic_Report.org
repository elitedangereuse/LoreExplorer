* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/25 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Official Ross 780 Law Party 

New CD-61 6801 Flag 

HIP 117865 Flag 

Freedom Party of Walka 

Future of Chapsugaibo 

Turnon Citizen Party 

Fenricha Gold Raiders

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

One Man, One Vote 

Xang Tzu Purple Advanced and Co 

HIP 106707 Silver Boys 

Integrated Qahat 

Omicron Columbae Boys 

bhodumba as one 

Purple General Systems	Empire 

Asgaa Blue Cartel 

Freedom Party of Neche 

Neche Order 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
