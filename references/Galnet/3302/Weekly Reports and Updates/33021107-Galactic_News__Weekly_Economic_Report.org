* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/07 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Yakabugai Exchange 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Order of Ethgreze 

Cemiess Commodities 

Eravate Network 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Zeessze Clan

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

HIP 1114 Progressive Party 

Sorbacoc Society 

Drug Empire of Caeresi 

Salibi Mafia 

Tun Netcoms Services 

Progressive Party of Ambika 

Noblemen of 17 Draconis 

Krumandaqu Crimson Cartel 

HIP 112753 Republic Party 

Liberate Ceos 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
