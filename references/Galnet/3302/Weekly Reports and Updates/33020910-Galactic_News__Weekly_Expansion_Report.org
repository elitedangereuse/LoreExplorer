* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/10 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

La Guardia Hispana 

Confederation of Julannsa 

LHS 3677 Purple Transport Org 

Sol Workers' Party 

Caicius Crimson Organisation 

Unionists of Cenu Kichs 

Hanissi Citizens of Tradition 

Konburus Corporation 

Erishiko Systems 

E.X.O 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Liberals of Yaringu 

Social Oresqu Resistance 

Deive Republic Party 

Brandano Gang 

Partnership of Luluwala 

LTT 2042 Partnership 

Democrats of Haroingori 

Kanga Bara PLC 

Bakulcan Brotherhood 

Pangkomo Gang 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
