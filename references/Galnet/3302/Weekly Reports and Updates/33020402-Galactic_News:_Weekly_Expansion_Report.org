* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/02 Apr 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Nobles of Kirrae	 

Sanuma Gold Dynamic Industries 

New Khaima Democrats 

Irulachan Jet Public Inc 

Jaroere Exchange 

HR 8380 Silver Central Solutions 

Crimson State Industry 

Alanaribri Transport Holdings 

Nationals of HIP 6108 

HIP 101857 Silver Life Int 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
