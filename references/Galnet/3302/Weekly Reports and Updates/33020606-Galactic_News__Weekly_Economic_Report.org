* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/06 Jun 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

G 41-14 Purple Travel Solutions 

Lave Jet Family 

Chimba Public Industries 

Liaedin Electronics PLC 

Potriambunn Jet Clan 

Sanna Galactic PLC 

Constitution Party of Eotienses 

Futhark Empire Assembly 

Mictlan Netcoms PLC

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Raiders of Corin	 

League of Poncali 

LTT 15278 Gang	 

BD-02 4304 Jet Drug Empire 

Jupalo Purple Boys 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Official Ho Hsien Liberty Party 

Allied Kamadhenu Nationalists 

Saktsak Movement 

Mob of Gende 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
