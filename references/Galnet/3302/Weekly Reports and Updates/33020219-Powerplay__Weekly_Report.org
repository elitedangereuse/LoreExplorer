Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, and the Alliance as a whole, celebrated the momentous signing of trade agreements in Mong Kung and Pincunche this week. With the finalization of these agreements, the Alliance network boasts a total of 90 influential trade hubs. The overall economic outlook in the Alliance remains the envy of other trade networks. 

Federal President Zachary Hudson's fleets easily corrected the supply shortages they were faced with last week, delivering approximately 6.6 billion credits worth of garrison supplies to naval bases throughout the president's sphere of influence. But President Hudson was unable to open a naval base in Concantae due to intense local opposition. The navy is now surveying numerous systems to find suitable accommodation for the burgeoning fleet. 

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters was unable to secure the support of the Amuzgo and Chukchan systems through aid packages and Liberal propaganda this week. But efforts to woo the political leaders of Djanharu, Juipedi and HIP 47328 are currently underway. Should these systems become supporters of the Shadow President, the Liberal party will hold sway in a total of 71 key systems. 

Princess Aisling Duval secured new supporters in HIP 77470 this week, bringing the total number of systems supporting the People's Princess to 63. Popular support for Princess Aisling is growing in the Ekono system, and it is expected that representatives from Ekono will affirm the system's support of the People's Princess by next Thursday. 

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval's attempts to secure a controlling interest in the infrastructures of V2689 Orionis and HR 6948 this week were unsuccessful. With no new acquisitions expected during the coming week, the senator will likely focus her efforts on quashing opposition from political dissidents within her sphere of influence. 

SiriusGov CEO Li Yong-Rui suffered setbacks in the Polecteri and San systems this week, preventing Sirius from incorporating the assets of both systems into the Sirius portfolio. Undaunted, Li Yong-Rui is preparing to finalize the purchase of both private and government sectors in the Aranka system during the coming week. 

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval was faced with continued supply shortages this week, forcing the Shield of Justice to terminate services in Olelbis, Damoorai and Kappa. Garrison supplies were consumed at near-record levels in Namamasairu, Bragit, Yab Camalo, Cibola, Redoneangi, Igal and Kuuku, jeopardizing the ability of the Shield of Justice to maintain adequate security. If the Emperor is forced to withdraw her fleets from all seven systems, her direct influence will extend to only 57 key systems. 

Simguru Pranav Antal welcomed the inhabitants of HIP 7076 into the Utopian fold this week, promising the populace a chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity. Utopians also celebrated a significant milestone in the fledgling power's history: Simguru Antal now has Utopian enclaves in 50 systems. 

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus secured harbour for his fleets in the Contie system this week, easily overcoming violent opposition from local dissidents. A number of arms deals fell through, however, weakening any plans the senator may have had to expand his influence. The coming week will be characterised by the defensive deployments of Patreus' fleets. 

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine successfully instigated infighting and violent insurrection in Morronii and HIP 111880 this week, and pirate vessels have been witnessed supporting criminal elements in both systems. The Pirate Lord appears poised to claim new territory mere weeks after he lost control of three systems.
