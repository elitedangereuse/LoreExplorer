* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/04 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Luyten 674-15 Industries 

Independents of Lalande 18115 

Kikians Purple Vision PLC 

Future of LTT 700

Argen Crimson State Partners

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Progressive Party of LHS 142 

63 G. Capricorni Independents 

Manah Interstellar 

Nobles of Fujin 

Sun Chuen General Ltd 

Bunuson Empire League 

Constitution Party of Koshans 

Tojo Industries 

Sirius Corporation 

HK Aquarii Industry 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
