* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/01 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

New 31 Aquilae Green Party 

Nuenets Corp. 

Progressive Party of LTT 15449 

Ross 490 Blue Public Corp. 

Movement for CD-37 641 Free 

Futhark Silver Fortune and Co 

Bast Purple Council 

LTT 14019 Public Group 

LHS 199 Silver Travel Corp 

Tetrian Fortune Network 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Harma Silver Cartel 

49 Arietis Gold Council 

Yuror Crimson Drug Empire 

HIP 1114 Blue Cartel 

Official Haroingori Defence Force 

Fire Fade Patron's Principles 

Drug Empire of Caeresi 

Hojin Blue Dragons 

Gridge Emperor's Grace 

Workers of Quillaente Union Party 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
