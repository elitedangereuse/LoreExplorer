* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/16 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

Eravate Network 

Official Darkates Freedom Party	 

Independent NLTT 49528 Left Party 

Bactondinks Ring 

Segoveduwa Empire Party 

Revolutionary Kappa Fornacis for Equality 

Tatapai Company 

LTT 9810 Silver Allied Network

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Undines Purple Comms Int 

Kolyawa Jet Life Systems 

Leaders of Pand 

Pand Inc 

Uszaa Society 

Xuanduna Purple Syndicate 

Cordenet Jet Ring 

HIP 43296 Blue Major Ltd 

GCRV 1568 Law Party 

Independent Iapo Vuh for Equality 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
