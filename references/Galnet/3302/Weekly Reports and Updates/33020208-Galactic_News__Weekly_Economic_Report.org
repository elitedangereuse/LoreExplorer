* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/08 Feb 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 12,567 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Kunie Future 

Bulgarlmadi Incorporated 

Sopdet Imperial Society 

Labour of Uadjiru 

HIP 4003 Empire League 

Purple Major Commodities 

New HIP 20869 Defence Force 

Cemiess Inc 

Avan Law Party 

Gondul Empire Group 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 576 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Labour of Cernobog 

Malloc Law Party 

Integrated Gundiae 

Brotherhood of Guathiti	 

Drug Empire of Apam Napat 

Evejitaka Liberals 

United Xuanduna Resistance 

Dragons of Nastrond 

Laedla Netcoms Systems 

Independents of Udihikoja 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
