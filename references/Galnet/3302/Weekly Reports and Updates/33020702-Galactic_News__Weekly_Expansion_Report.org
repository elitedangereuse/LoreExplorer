* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/02 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Caspatsuria Empire Assembly 

Glutia Citizens of Tradition 

Social Ix Chita Partnership 

Windri and Co 

Xue Davokje Empire League 

62 Ursae Majoris Silver Life Ltd 

Wu Kich Solutions 

Parnut Purple Power Corporation 

LP 747-25 Creative Organisation	 

Rugai Interstellar 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

HR 8170 Brotherhood 

15 Pegasi Legal Limited 

LP 715-52 Network 

BD-08 535 Services 

Jarildekald Public Industry 

Chem Holdings 

People's 73 Rho Cygni Democrats 

LP 404-66 Life Industry 

Values Party of LTT 10462 

Huokang Silver Universal Ind 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
