* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/19 Mar 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Asvincegin Empire Pact 

Simarasir Dynamic Solutions 

Volkhabe Blue United Solutions 

Nepehuevit Empire Assembly 

V2160 Cygni Values Party 

Tjupany Blue Life Corp. 

HIP 34961 Empire League 

Revolutionary Gorgon Liberals 

Wayan Energy Network 

Left Party of Polecteri 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
