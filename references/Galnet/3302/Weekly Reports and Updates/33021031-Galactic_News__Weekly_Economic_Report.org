* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/31 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Eravate Life Services 

LTT 700 Silver Federal Exchange 

Dragons of Tepertsi 

Liberty Party of Tau Ceti 

LFT 1834 Corp. 

Clan of LHS 1110 

Independents of IL Aquarii 

LFT 133 Exchange 

Movement for Tetek Future 

Textovices Universal Corp. 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

E.X.O 

Progressive Party of Bolg 

Independent Guan Zaihe League 

Co-op of Mbokokumal 

Integrated Shu Babassi 

Revolutionary 5 G. Apodis Values Party 

Hojin Blue Dragons 

Dukes of LTT 2893 

Sorbacoc Society 

Namniez Free 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
