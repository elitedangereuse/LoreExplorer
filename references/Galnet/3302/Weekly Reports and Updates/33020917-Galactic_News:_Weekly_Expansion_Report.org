* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/17 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Sons Blue Fortune Network 

Lords of LHS 1963 

Partnership of Semakana 

Jaques 

Bodhinga Empire Assembly 

Deili Confederation 

Wuthawchu Blue Bridge Inc 

HIP 118040 Exchange 

Official Tepi Regulatory State 

HIP 104206 Emperor's Grace 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Decan Silver Ring 

Progressive Party of Paemalites 

Cet Republic Party 

Tirawati Prison Colony 

HR 1064 Netcoms Holdings 

Natural Namamasairu Flag 

Workers of Krinda Future 

Ys Silver Major Group 

Huiche Incorporated 

Xi-2 Lupi Resistance 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
