* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/03 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

BD-20 2665 State Organisation 

Progressive Party of Nawait 

Guincans Legal PLC 

Quaaybuwan Partnership 

Bidiono Independents 

Tewi Guardians of Tradition 

Elite German Commanders 

New BD-18 394 Autocracy 

Raba Solutions 

Dukes of Lepchaimyu 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Social Savii Confederacy	 

New Arexack Law Party 

LTT 617 Regulatory State 

Surmati Limited 

Olurung Blue Legal PLC 

Pa Para Partners 

LAWD 8 Major Corp. 

61 Ursae Majoris Liberals 

Nuakea Republic Party 

Democrats of Ruwachis 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
