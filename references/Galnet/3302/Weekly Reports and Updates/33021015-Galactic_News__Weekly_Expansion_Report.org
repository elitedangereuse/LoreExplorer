* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/15 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Shaplintin Labour 

Democrats of LTT 9104 

Bureau of HR 827 Constitution Party 

HIP 14676 Dominion 

Kokopatji Gold Fortune Exchange 

Progressive Party of Gullveti 

Future of Guayambaan 

Wiknariu Industries 

Angelic Church of Messi 

Menero Kimi Empire Group 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Urd Confederation 

Latugara Society 

Nurundere Labour 

Ualangur Gold Comms Corp. 

Jolagro Dragons	 

Movement for LHS 28 for Equality 

Ross 1003 Prison Colony 

Pacalite Universal Systems 

CD-47 990 Company 

Umbrogo Partnership 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
