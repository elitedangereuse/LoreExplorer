* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/19 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Order of Ethgreze 

Zeessze Clan 

Yimanbin Industries 

Kitche Citizens' Forum 

LHS 1110 Patron's Principles 

Stafkarl Stakeholders 

New Belenja Defence Party 

HIP 296 Purple Bridge Systems 

Velnians Revolutionary Party 

Lalande 10797 Comms Holdings 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Kraurno Blue Brothers 

Kamadhenu Netcoms Corporation 

Salibi Mafia 

Namniez Free 

Ross 209 Fortune Organisation 

Revolutionary 5 G. Apodis Values Party 

Yuror Crimson Drug Empire 

Movement for Pipi Free 

Independent HR 8526 for Equality 

Co-operative of HIP 113113 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
