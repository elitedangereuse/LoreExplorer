* Galactic News: Weekly Security Report

/16 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the security status of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience a lockdown: 

Lalande 17161 Universal Partners 

LHS 4019 Legal Ltd

Altair Regulatory State 

United Kausalya Nationalists 

Green Party of Ehlanda 

Social HR 1475 Values Party

When a faction experiences a lockdown, the security rating of the system it controls temporarily increases and the system's wealth temporarily decreases. Bounty hunting activity can shorten the lockdown period. 

Here are the latest factions to experience civil unrest: 

New Groombridge 1618 Focus 

Vequess Brotherhood 

Cartel of Wolf 397 

Official LHS 1547 Party 

Concantae Vision Incorporated 

BD-11 4932 Justice Party 

LP 564-39 First

Civil unrest is the result of illegal activity. When a faction is affected by civil unrest, the standard of living in the system it controls temporarily decreases, as does the system's wealth. Combat missions and activities can bring civil unrest to an end.
