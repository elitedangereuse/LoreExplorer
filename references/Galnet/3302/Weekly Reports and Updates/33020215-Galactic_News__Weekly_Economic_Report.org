* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/15 Feb 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 12,144 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Coalition of Darahk 

Lhou Xuang Prison Colony 

HIP 60662 Interstellar 

NLTT 47967 Industries 

Wakonoto Universal Limited 

Lambda-1 Tucanae Citizen's Party 

Llwydanane Exchange 

HR 6565 Purple Natural Ltd 

Progressive Party of LP 747-25 

Independents of Timbarichs 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 544 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Mahei Posse 

Huokang Crimson Dynamic Co 

Zaonce Jet Gang 

14 i Orionis Jet Camorra 

Luhman 16 First 

Bhumliaurt Blue Brothers 

Revolutionary Songbe Green Party 

Epsilon Indi Party 

Earls of Uzumeru 

CU Cancri Purple Brothers 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
