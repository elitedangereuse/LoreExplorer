* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/05 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Opila Ltd 

Luyten's Star Co	 

HIP 1914 Purple Universal Inc 

LTT 15449 Dynamic Incorporated 

Betel Defence Party 

HIP 113010 Company 

Wuthielo Ku Progressive Party 

Democrats of Liu Di 

EQ Pegasi Jet Power Partners 

United Bese Party 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Aditi Jet Universal Interstellar 

Kikapu Stakeholders 

CdE Corporation 

Traditional Chamunda Nationalists 

Revolutionary Nemehi Future 

Vortex Continuum 

Values Party of Nervi 

Nebula Goat Appreciation Society 

Chamunda Crimson Travel Exchange 

Tun Dynamic Corp. 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
