* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/08 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Li K'anja Energy Industries 

Partnership of Li Cha 

Pleiades Resource Enterprise 

Independents of Lie Yupik 

Black Omega 

Kacomam Empire Group 

LHS 411 Advanced Incorporated	 

Paeling Blue Life and Co 

Vadimo Patrons of Law 

Browncoat Uprising 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Labour of 64 Arietis 

Law Party of Umaitis 

Partnership of HIP 19147 

Nuevo Orden de Comandantes Imperiales 

CD-87 103 Imperial Society 

Yen Di Travel Inc 

Tsanyala Patrons of Law	 

New Tjindjin Revolutionary Party 

Workers of K Camelopardalis Resistance	 

Kuruages Republic Party 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
