* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/14 Mar 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 10,718 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Wawal Partners	 

New Gamma Leporis Alliance 

LP 376-62 Collective 

New Wardaliti Future 

Hernir Left Party 

Ibormbu for Equality 

Camunab Citizens' Forum 

LP 864-1 Purple Legal Industry 

LP 869-42 Drug Empire 

LTT 9850 Crimson Partnership 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 472 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

People's Kehperi People's Party 

Labour of Ghimr 

HIP 114472 Limited 

Orishpucho Jet Hand Gang 

Tiburnat Gold Society 

Iota Pictoris A Syndicate	 

Velingai Blue Society 

HIP 60902 Fortune Company 

Cartel of Diaguandri 

HIP 20342 Jet Syndicate 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
