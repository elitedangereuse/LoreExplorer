* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/11 Jan 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 12,484 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

Revolutionary Kitchih Confederation 

Nobles of Kirrae	 

United LHS 6305 Conservatives 

Union of HIP 99966 Revolutionary Party 

Khakmo Alliance 

Union Party of HIP 112859 

Dukes of HIP 19591 

Cartel of Khaka 

Jet Netcoms Corporation 

LP 71-157 Corp. 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 978 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Ross 720 Crimson Cartel 

Lusonda Society	 

Kamorin Network 

Chielas Travel Industries 

Raiders of Summerland 

Samen Citizens' Forum 

Nidarijedi Empire Party 

HIP 108598 Comms Company 

New Kali Law Party 

Camorra of Epsilon Eridani 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
