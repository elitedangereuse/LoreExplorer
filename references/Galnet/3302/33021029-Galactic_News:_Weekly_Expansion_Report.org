* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/29 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Andhi Liberals 

Kuo Zhi Partnership 

Regulatory State of Kausan 

1 G. Caeli Empire League 

Earth Defense Fleet 

Syndicate of Tiburi He 

Justice Party of Anekaliti 

Values Party of BD+43 2989 

HIP 27371 Empire League 

Values Party of Gliese 9204 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Samen Crimson General Services 

Munshin Allied PLC 

Union of 6 Ceti Free 

Narantan Nationals 

Tz'utuls Progressive Party 

Wolf 1051 State Industry 

LTT 9810 Citizens' Forum 

Workers of Kakas Free 

Wei Chang Empire League 

V857 Centauri Coalition 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
