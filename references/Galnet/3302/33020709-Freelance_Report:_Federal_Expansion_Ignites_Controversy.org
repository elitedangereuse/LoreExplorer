* Freelance Report: Federal Expansion Ignites Controversy

/09 Jul 3302/

The announcement of Federal plans to expand into the Pleiades Nebula, and the Federation's call for the support of independent pilots, has ignited a firestorm of controversy. Although there is support for the Federation's goals, many have expressed reservations. 

One Commander, who wished to remain anonymous due to his rank in the Federal Naval Reserve, clarified his concerns: 

"The Federation has a history of concealment when it comes to discoveries suggesting the existence of non-human entities." 

"We don't know how long Federal scientists have been experimenting with the Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probes, but we do know they came to public awareness when they fell out of Federation vessels. We don't know much about the barnacles, but we know the Federation has set up perimeters around them." 

"I believe in the Federation," he continued, "but there is an element within it that wants to cover up important information about humanity's place in the galaxy. That information belongs to everyone. We must demand increased transparency and openness before allowing the Federation to assume greater influence."
