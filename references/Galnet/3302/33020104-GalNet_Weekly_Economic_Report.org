* GalNet Weekly Economic Report

/04 Jan 3302/

In this weekly digest, the latest GalNet data is compiled to show the economic state of a short list of minor factions and the star systems they inhabit. 

Here are 10 of the 12,327 minor factions currently enjoying an economic boom: 

LHS 1798 Gold Life Systems 

Earls of Miritu 

Iktomisi Advanced Group 

Cartel of Cebalrai 

Herfjongo Independent League 

Allied HIP 113103 Dominion 

Kutjalangai Allied and Co 

Turd Wura Corp. 

Togher Movement 

HR 755 Electronics Commodities 

When in boom, the wealth of a system is increased for the duration and all trade missions have double the effect on influence. Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine. 

Here are 10 of the 950 factions currently experiencing economic bust: 

Santjalan Labour 

Bureau of LHS 6027 Liberty Party 

Glusargiz Energy Exchange 

CD-66 2585 Purple Cartel 

Wolf 1458 Society 

Aurgel Silver Hand Gang 

Svanticani Purple Public Prtnrs 

HIP 24968 Energy Corp. 

Wuluwait Boys 

CD-70 19 Public Incorporated 

The wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.
