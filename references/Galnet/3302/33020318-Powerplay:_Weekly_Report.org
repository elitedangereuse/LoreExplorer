* Powerplay: Weekly Report

/18 Mar 3302/

The Powerplay Weekly Report summarizes the activities of the galaxy's movers and shakers in the Federation, the Empire, the Alliance, and Independent spheres of influence during the previous week. 

The Federation: 

The Federation experienced resource shortfalls affecting the areas of responsibility of both President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters this week. President Hudson recalled Federal fleets from Allawa and HIP 24046. If resource shortfalls are not accounted for within the coming week, President Hudson may be forced to withdraw fleets from Li Jungu, AF Leporis, and Korovii. Similarly, Shadow President Winters is struggling to meet aid commitments to HIP 38747, and is in danger of losing the system's support.  

The Empire: 

A dozen key systems were the focus of Imperial political machinations this week. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval deployed the Shield of Justice to Acokwang, Ao Kax, and Hrun, where the fleets now enforce Imperial justice. Senator Zemina Torval expended significant resources to finalize the purchase of key infrastructure throughout the Gacrux system. Princess Aisling Duval's campaign suffered some setbacks this week. Six influential systems, Mula Wendes, Nyalayan, HIP 95256, HIP 105391, HIP 3603, and Blod, withdrew their direct support for the People's Princess. Senator Denton Patreus' fleets moved into Anganaha and HIP 116045, where they now defend Imperial interests on behalf of the Admiral of the Fleet. 

The Alliance: 

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon secured a trade agreement for the Alliance in Ross 842. Alliance negotiators are currently seeking to forge trade ties with four additional systems, Aranbarahun Fedmich, HR 6328, and Ross 151. Should they succeed, the Alliance will boast a network of 95 trade centers. 

Independents: 

The growth of Utopia, under the leadership of Simguru Pranav Antal, was the highlight of the week in the Independent sphere of influence, with Brynhilo and Har Itariu officially becoming part of Utopia. CEO Li Yong-Rui was unable to extend a Sirius franchise to any new systems this week, but is working to finalize a contract in V780 Tauri next week. Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's attempt to overthrow Latugara was unsuccessful this week. No new Kumo incited insurrections have been spotted this week, but criminal activity is stirring in systems bordering the Pegasi sector.
