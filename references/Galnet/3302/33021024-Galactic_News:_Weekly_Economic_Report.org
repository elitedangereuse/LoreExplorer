* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/24 Oct 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Cemiess Commodities 

Allied FK5 2550 Autocracy 

Ngaledi Federal Corporation 

Ross 490 Mafia 

Tau-2 Gruis A Universal Inc 

LDS 883 Gold Galactic Services 

Mictlan Empire Assembly 

Cosi Flag 

LHS 1110 Patron's Principles 

Epsilon Phoenicis Principles 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

People's Llyr Free 

HIP 12155 Blue Council 

People's Tun for Equality 

LP 715-52 Purple Hand Gang 

Brotherhood of LP 98-132 

BD+49 3937 Liberals 

Leaders of Unelenses 

Confederation of Dahan	 

Urd Confederation 

Coalition of Kannari 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
