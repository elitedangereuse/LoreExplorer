* Community Goal: Final Stage of Wildcard Competition

/16 Jun 3302/

With the second stage of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition complete, the third and final stage can now begin. 

This phase of the competition will focus on trade, with pilots being asked to gather as many conductive fabrics as possible for their chosen faction. The group with the most conductive fabrics at the end of the week-long event will be declared the winner. 

At the close of the Wildcard competition, the faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will enter the Dangerous Games and compete for the right to be recognised as an official power. 

With the end of the competition looming, each faction is eager to secure as much support as possible, and is doing all it can to attract pilots to its cause.  

The event begins on the 16th of June 3302 and will run for one week.
