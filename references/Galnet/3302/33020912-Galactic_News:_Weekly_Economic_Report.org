* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/12 Sep 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Brani Federal Holdings 

Liberals of Delta Pavonis 

CD-37 641 Network 

Jeterait Bridge Interstellar 

LHS 199 Guardians of Tradition 

HIP 1885 Crimson Transport Comms 

Workers of BV Phoenicis Free 

Acokwech People's Co-operative 

Progressive Party of LP 493-64 

Defence Force of Idini 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

People's Tabassapisi Progressive Party 

Future of LHS 3447 

Society of Ngalinn 

Conservatives of Hisaaka 

Partnership of LHS 2819 

Revolutionary Morai Citizen Party 

Lords of the DarkStar Imperium 

Coalition of Ngaliba 

Eranin Peoples Party 

Hojin Blue Dragons 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
