* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/23 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Ambivas Power Partners 

Adeo Vision Industries

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Left Party of Ch'i Lingo 

Lacaille 9352 Silver Gang 

Xihe Purple Brothers 

Apurui General Co 

HIP 13644 Clan	Independent 

CD-37 1883 Values Party 

Sisina Travel Corp. 

Posse of Vega 

Kausalya Boys 

Arouca Focus 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
