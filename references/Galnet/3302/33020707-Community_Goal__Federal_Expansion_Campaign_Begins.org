* Community Goal: Federal Expansion Campaign Begins

/07 Jul 3302/

The Future of Segovan, a Federal organisation based in the Segovan system, has announced plans to construct a number of new Federal Naval outposts, starting in Segovan and reaching out into the Pleiades sector. 

The bases will serve as resupply points for Federal vessels, and will support ongoing Federal operations in the region. 

A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said: 

"This is an ambitious initiative that will only succeed with the support of the galactic community. We are therefore calling on all Federation-aligned pilots to deliver insulating membrane, gallium and power generators to our base of operations at Ramsbottom Hub, so we can start work on the first outpost." 

The initiative begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
