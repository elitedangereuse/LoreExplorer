* Galactic News: Retail Appeal Ends

/01 Dec 3302/

A spokesperson for Tchernobog Free has announced that its appeal for consumer goods has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge quantity of deliveries to Vancouver Ring, the organisation's base of operations. 

The support of the galactic community allowed Tchernobog Free to keep up with the incredibly high demand ushered in by last Friday's competitive one-day deals. 

In a statement, the spokesperson said: 

"I'd all but given up. I just couldn't see how we'd get the goods in time. But then a ship docked at Vancouver Ring, groaning under the weight of its cargo. And then another, and another." 

"To the pilots who came to our aid, I just want to say â€“ you saved my life!" 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vancouver Ring in the Tchernobog system.
