A spokesperson for Gyvatices Crimson Advanced Holdings has announced that its appeal for fish and coffee was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Walter Dock in the Gyvatices system. The commodities will be used in a special fish and coffee festival to honour the late entrepreneur Walter Waldo. 

Gyvatices Crimson Advanced Holdings has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Walter Dock in the Gyvatices system.
