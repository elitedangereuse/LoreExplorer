* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/16 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Ross 42 Services 

Durinn Gold Natural Interstellar 

United Heiltsu Left Party 

Haritana Dynamic Group 

Ngobriglai Services 

Independent Kaus Australis Values Party 

HIP 15376 Gold Creative Limited 

LFT 361 Independents 

BD+14 1876 Independents 

Etznabal Imperial Society 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Ambibates Inc 

Mariang Patrons of Law 

LFT 90 State Incorporated 

BD-01 3500 Electronics Services 

LFT 78 Patron's Principles 

Wolf 225 Federal Industry 

Nidarijedi Empire Party 

Mara Systems 

Confederacy of LPM 696 

HIP 118311 Empire Party 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
