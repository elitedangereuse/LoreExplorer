* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/11 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Natural BV Phoenicis Front 

Manbatz Future 

Yemakinni Organisation

Values Party of Priva

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Lave Fortune Organisation 

Kraurno Blue Brothers 

Belenses Services 

Dimor and Co 

Tewinicnii Vision Corporation 

Baraswar Crimson Vision Ltd 

Tsu Purple Power Interstellar 

Kamadhenu Netcoms Corporation 

Liberty Party of Lodhary 

People's Tun for Equality 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
