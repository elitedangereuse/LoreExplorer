Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon did not have the opportunity to sign new trade agreements this week. Pending the conclusion of negotiations in Ross 842 and HIP 55118, the Alliance trade network will encompass an impressive 90 centres. Authorities in HIP 73269 have invited Alliance delegates to discuss the possibility of establishing another trade hub in the system. 

Federal President Zachary Hudson sent Federal security task forces into the Detta, Dongkum, and HIP 24046 systems this week, ultimately establishing a permanent presence for Federal fleets in all three systems. Federal fleets have also surged into Carpaka and LPM 229. If a military presence is established in these additional systems, President Hudson will control a total of 81 naval bases. 

Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters was unable to secure support in the Amuzgo system this week, but the coming week holds opportunities for the Shadow President in the Sawali and Chi'iang Fei systems. Extensive aid campaigns are underway, demonstrating the capabilities of Federal welfare and healthcare programmes. Should these systems join Felicia Winters, she will be the power of choice in a total of 69 systems. 

Emperor Arissa Lavigny Duval has recovered from her resource shortfalls, netting a vast reserve of capital to finance the expansion of the Shield of Justice. Waimiri is currently playing host to the Shield of Justice, and leveraging the fleet to rid the system of criminal activity.  

Princess Aisling Duval had a mixed week, as the HIP 116045 system terminated its support for the People's Princess, and Kuki An and Nyalayan joined her cause. No new systems are expected to join her cause next week, but Aisling's publicity teams are reportedly planning to unleash a media blitz in a fortnight. 

Imperial Senator Zemina Torval was able to return her enterprises to a state of financial solvency this week, and to acquire a majority share in the infrastructure in the Yakama system. The profitability of her business has allowed the senator to begin looking for new investment opportunities, and she is expected to make new acquisitions in the coming weeks. 

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was able to accumulate a large reserve of credit through shrewd investment this week, meaning he will be able to extend offers to businesses in the Polecteri, Pukkeitsi, and Kwaritreni systems next week. Negotiations in Hyldeptu and LP 711-32 are expected to conclude by next Thursday. Should the negotiations conclude in Sirius' favour, Sirius Gov will hold controlling interests in a total of 56 systems. 

Simguru Pranav Antal secured another system this week as violent protests in the Kenna system were decisively ended. Utopian ambassadors have negotiated to establish enclaves in the Taosha and Sukree systems, but opposition to the Utopian presence has led to fierce protests in these systems. Should Antal's forces prevail, Utopia could grow to encompass a total of 51 key systems. 

Imperial Senator Denton Patreus concluded the sale of arms to 23 Delta Piscis Austrini this week, and his fleets have already begun moving into the system. But resistance to the presence of Patreus' fleets has solidified, and fighting has broken out in several locations in 23 Delta Piscis Austrini. 

Pirate Lord Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew withdrew from the He Xians, Brynhilo and Bhattra systems following last week's uprisings. After months of subjugation and exploitation, the populace has now adopted a defensive stance in the hope of preventing possible re-conquest. Archon has additional uprisings to deal with this week, but with his forces now more concentrated, it is unlikely he will give further ground.
