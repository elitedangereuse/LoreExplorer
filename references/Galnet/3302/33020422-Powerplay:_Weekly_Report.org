* Powerplay: Weekly Report

/22 Apr 3302/

The Powerplay weekly report summarises the recent activities of the Federation, Empire, the Alliance, and in Independent spheres of influence. 

The Federation: 

President Hudson was flooded with intelligence reports from Federal agencies in Contien this week, but Federal task forces were recalled when an extensive Alliance diplomatic convoy operating in the Kaukai area was discovered. 

Shadow President Winters was unable to secure agreements with the citizens of HIP 50489 or Kappa. As a result, Federal aid has been redirected from both systems to Ch'iang Fei and LTT 5964. 

The Empire: 

The HR 4720 system was cleansed of criminal activity by a Shield of Justice blitz, ensuring Imperial justice will prevail in the system. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's private security fleet now operates in 67 star systems. 

Senator Zemina Torval added the infrastructure of the Candecama system to her enterprises this week, but no additional acquisitions are planned for next week. 

Princess Aisling Duval's public support was substantially undermined this week, jeopardizing support for the People's Princess in the Aluriates, Blod, Erisha, HIP 116710 and Karakasis systems. 

Admiral Denton Patreus saw an arms deal with the Medzistha system fall through. In the coming week, many of his backers are likely to support the construction of a new Majestic-class Interdictor in the Mundjiga system. 

The Alliance: 

The Alliance's economic outlook improved significantly this week, providing numerous opportunities to restore broken trade agreements and create opportunities for economic expansion. Alliance diplomats are seeking to secure exclusive trade agreements with several Federal systems in addition to some independent systems, partly in response to corporate Federal blockades of Alliance trading hubs. The targeted systems include Akheilos, Aranbarahun, Beta Hydri, CD-27 5409, FAUST 3566, Gendalla, and Kaukai. 

Independents: 

Sirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui was unable to acquire sufficient assets in Chang O to bring it under Sirius' exclusive control, and no new deals are likely to cross his desk next week.  

Utopia was able to secure new supporters in Anouphis or LP 708-253, bringing the number of key systems controlled by Simguru Pranav Antal to 50. 

Criminal elements backed by the Kumo Crew have instigated violent insurrections in the 7 Zeta-2 Lyrae, Dhanchu, HIP 103138 and San Guan systems. With the major powers seemingly turning a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the Pirate Lord Archon Delaine, the Kumo Crew is likely to swell its number of strongholds to 46.
