* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/23 Jul 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion and withdrawal among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems: 

Lutni Patrons of Law 

Liberals of Kappa Reticuli 

BD+22 4939 Purple Cartel 

Mafia of G 107-65 

Lalande 28607 Syndicate 

Tribeb Empire Party 

Beta Pavonis Incorporated 

Conservatives of Cockaigne 

Liu Yanec Solutions 

United LFT 174 Future 

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced. 

Here are the latest factions in withdrawal: 

Domoth Empire Party 

Kalibia State Services 

LTT 11103 Jet Legal Corporation	 

League of 23 Librae 

HR 7907 and Co 

Democrats of LHS 3885 

Values Party of 79 Ceti 

Afli Patron's Principles 

Exphiay Crimson Hand Gang 

Barons of Chang Shor 

Factions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system.
