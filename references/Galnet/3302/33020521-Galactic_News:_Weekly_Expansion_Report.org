* Galactic News: Weekly Expansion Report

/21 May 3302/

This report presents the latest data on expansion among the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to have expanded into new systems:

Expansions occur when a minor faction reaches a sufficient level of influence and there is a populated system within striking distance. Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.
