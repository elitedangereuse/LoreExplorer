/09 Sep 3302/

A pilot by the name of Commander Falchion has won the Melee Masters arena competition. 

In a tense final bout, Commander Falchion appeared to give up right on the cusp of victory, but it was revealed to have been a ruse designed to bring his opponent into firing range. 

A reporter from Sports Zeta Weekly commented: "I had no fingernails by the end of that one. The sheer moxie of Commander Falchion, to sucker in his opponent like that! Big risk, big payoff. The crowds loved it! A worthy winner." 

Commander Falchion was not available for interview and appears to maintaining a cloak of anonymity, although it is known that he or she is from the Chi Orionis system.
