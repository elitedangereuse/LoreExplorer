* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/28 Nov 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Colanja Gold Power Services 

Limapa Blue State Commodities 

Wolf 359 Blue Travel Commodities 

Union of Wolf 359 Labour 

Ngaliba Blue Camorra 

Coalition of Ngaliba 

Lords of Ngaliba 

Potriti Gold Mafia 

Eravate Network

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

Zaragas Energy Corp.	 

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel 

HIP 118311 Posse 

LTT 537 Future 

Drug Empire of Caeresi 

Vasho Mafia 

Lambda-1 Tucanae Progressive Party 

Velnambang Rats 

Salibi Mafia 

Rautandji Gold Partnership 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
