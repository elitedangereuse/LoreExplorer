* Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report

/22 Aug 3302/

This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom: 

Cemiess Commodities 

Lave Jet Family 

HIP 296 Empire Group 

HIP 296 Guardians of Tradition 

BD+23 3151 Camorra 

LTT 874 Empire Assembly 

Imenhit Limited 

Nang Ta-khian Public Co 

Social Caelinus Union 

Aztlan Hand Gang 

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire. 

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust: 

HIP 37171 Blue Rats 

HIP 118169 Democrats 

Keries Camorra 

Regulatory State of HIP 32812 

Chamunda Crimson Gang 

Progressive Party of Wu Guinagi 

Kini Travel Co 

HIP 30953 Defence Force 

Carthage Silver Drug Empire 

Batz Independents 

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
