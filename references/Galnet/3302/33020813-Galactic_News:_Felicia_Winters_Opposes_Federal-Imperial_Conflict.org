* Galactic News: Felicia Winters Opposes Federal-Imperial Conflict

/13 Aug 3302/

At a rally on Mars in the Sol system, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters has addressed the escalating tension between the Federation and the Empire. 

While careful not to criticise Federal President Zachary Hudson, Winters made her position on the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict clear. Addressing citizens who had gathered to support her, the shadow president said: 

"I may disagree with Edmund Mahon on a number of issues, but I share his views on the current political climate." 

"Both the Federation and the Empire have access to tremendous military power, and a war between our two societies could have a disastrous impact on the galaxy. We must turn away from acrimony, and move towards mutual understanding and cooperation. It is not too late to change course." 

Winters's words were warmly received by the assembled crowds.
