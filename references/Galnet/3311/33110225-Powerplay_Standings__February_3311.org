This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica. 

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence: 

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,431 systems 

Rank 2: Aisling Duval – 1,410 systems 

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval – 1,328 systems 

Rank 4: Yuri Grom – 1,020 systems 

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui – 801 systems 

The largest increase in system influence belonged to Li Yong-Rui, who can claim an additional 77 systems as supporters. 

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.
