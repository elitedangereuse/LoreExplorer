* Titan Wreckage In Sol Draws Keen Interest

/29 Jan 3311/

The wreckage of Titan Cocijo far above Earth has attracted thousands of ships over the past several weeks. 

As extensively reported in December, a huge effort from the Federal Navy, the Pilots’ Federation and other independent pilots brought down the last remaining Thargoid Titan after it assaulted the Sol system. Titan Cocijo’s destruction was confirmed on December 18th 3310. 

An excerpt from an article by Jason Nygaard of the Federal Times offered the following: 

“Thousands of ships have descended on the carcass of Titan Cocijo now that the caustic cloud left in the mothership’s wake has dissipated to less hazardous levels. Some seek to claim a trophy of this military victory, while others seek to gain knowledge of Thargoid technology. Others still have been seen posing for selfies, using external camera modules to take the perfect snapshot for ICE channels.” 

“Federal authorities had sought to limit the number of visitors to the site, citing military security and safety concerns. But with other Titan wreckages similarly popular, adventurous pilots have mostly ignored these protocols and there seems to be little appetite to enforce them.” 

A memorial beacon to remember those lost during the Second Thargoid War and the Battle of Sol has been deployed in the system.
