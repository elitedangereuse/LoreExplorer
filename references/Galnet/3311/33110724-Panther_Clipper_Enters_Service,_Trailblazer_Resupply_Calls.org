* Panther Clipper Enters Service, Trailblazer Resupply Calls

/24 Jul 3311/

Zorgon Peterson has confirmed that the Panther Clipper heavy freighter has entered full-scale production following two successful community-led support initiatives. 

Independent pilots played a vital role in stabilising final-phase manufacturing, with critical commodities delivered to production facilities at Vespucci City. Security operations were also pivotal, with coordinated action clearing pirate threats and safeguarding high-priority convoys across the Aiaba system. 

A spokesperson for Zorgon Peterson stated: 

“We’re proud to see the Panther Clipper launched on schedule. The response from the pilot community has been overwhelming, and instrumental, in making this happen. Early sales have been promising, and we’re looking forward to seeing the Panther’s impact on interstellar trade.” 

Pilots are now being asked to deliver aluminium, steel, titanium, and CMM composites to replenish Trailblazer megaship stock reserves as they supply humanity’s newest frontier regions. The considerable success of independent colonisation efforts has placed pressure on Brewer Corporation’s stocks of these materials. 

Brewer Corporation’s primary distribution silo at Starlace Station in Minerva is hosting shipments, with a modified cargo rack listed among the rewards.
