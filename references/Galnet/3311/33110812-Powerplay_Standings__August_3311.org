This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica. 

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence: 

Rank 1: Aisling Duval – 1,936 systems 

Rank 2: Edmund Mahon - 1,674 systems 

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval – 1,616 systems 

Rank 4: Yuri Grom – 1,201 systems 

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui – 1,183 systems 

The largest increase in system influence belonged to Aisling Duval who can claim an additional 275 systems as supporters. 

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.
