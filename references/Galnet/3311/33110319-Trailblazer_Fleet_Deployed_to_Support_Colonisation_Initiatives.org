* Trailblazer Fleet Deployed to Support Colonisation Initiatives

/19 Mar 3311/

The Trailblazer fleet announced by Brewer Corporation last month has been deployed to strategic locations on the edges of the core systems. 

Described as ‘colonisation support hubs,’ the Trailblazer fleet provides a bespoke trade market focused on colonisation materials and goods. The first wave of independent colonisation efforts has been described as ‘overwhelmingly popular’ by Brewer COO Mark Rennik. 

The fledgling public arm of Brewer’s claim management service has been inundated with requests, and Rennik confirmed that the number of claims had proved challenging. “The speed at which new systems have been settled and expanded is frankly astonishing,” Rennik said in a recent interview, “and I'm delighted that so many pioneers have taken full advantage of this opportunity.” 

The Trailblazer fleet has been deployed to the following star systems: 

Trailblazer Dream - HIP 90578 

Trailblazer Song - Orgen 

Trailblazer Wish - Bletii 

Trailblazer Star - 34 Omicron Cephei 

Trailblazer Promise - Klikis 

Trailblazer Faith - Ngobe 

Trailblazer Echo has returned to the Minerva system.
