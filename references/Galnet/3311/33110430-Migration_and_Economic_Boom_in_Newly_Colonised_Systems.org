* Migration and Economic Boom in Newly Colonised Systems

/30 Apr 3311/

Migrants are flocking from the core systems to begin new lives in the thousands of recently established colonies. 

A wave of independent colonisation efforts over the past few months have increased human territory considerably. While many of these star systems have been classified as ‘waypoints’, with singular docking outposts for journeys between systems with wider infrastructure, a significant number have been expanded with multiple starports and settlements. 

It is these that billions of people are now heading towards in the hope of starting fresh. Workers and their families are starting to arrive in large numbers, bringing with them a major boost to economic output. 

With the influx of population, the new colonies will be more capable of producing their own colonisation-related commodities, with economies now driven by linking installations and markets placed throughout the system. Analysts believe that, over time, this ability to self-sustain expansion efforts will prove vital if the colonies are to be successful in the long term. 

Professor Irene Ralston, head of political history at Olympus Village University, wrote for the Federal Times: 

“It is fair to say that, in terms of scale, this is the largest migration event in human history. This migration appears to be fuelled by a hope for a new chapter — the chance to become part of a ‘new frontier’. No doubt the upheaval of the recent Thargoid invasion had some influence in the decision making, but the sheer numbers involved are fascinating.” 

It is expected that, when economies and populations begin to settle, Brewer Corporation’s Trailblazer fleet of megaships which currently supply many colonies will be repurposed for other duties. 

Brewer Corporation also revealed that it has prepared a variety of custom layouts and decorative suites, allowing architects to visually tailor their new constructions. This latest innovation from the industrial giant is available for deployment from today.
