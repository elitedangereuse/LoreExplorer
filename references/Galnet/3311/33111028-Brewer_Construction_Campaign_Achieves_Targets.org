* Brewer Construction Campaign Achieves Targets

/28 Oct 3311/

Brewer Corporation has confirmed the success of its recent campaign to acquire construction materials, with independent pilots delivering vast quantities of resources to meet its clients’ order. 

CEO Madelyn Teague released a statement from Brewer’s Minerva headquarters: 

“Our sincere thanks go to the many pilots who supported this campaign. The required stocks have been secured in record time, enabling us to meet the terms of this urgent order.” 

Independent observers believe that the concentration of megaship traffic and the secrecy surrounding the order, together with the reported direct messages to pilots pledged to one of the twelve Powers, are strong indicators of an intention to rapidly construct a science and security enclave around HIP 87621. 

Analysts have concluded that given the sheer scale of Brewer Corporation’s logistical operations deployed for this project, the enclave could be completed within just a few days. 

Lexi October has remained tight-lipped following the news, with many now speculating whether she will bow to pressure from the Superpowers to remove the permit lock.
