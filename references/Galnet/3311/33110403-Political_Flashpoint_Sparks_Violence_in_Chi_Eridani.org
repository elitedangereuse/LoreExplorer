* Political Flashpoint Sparks Violence in Chi Eridani

/03 Apr 3311/

Imperial agents have been blamed for an outbreak of combat in the Federally controlled Chi Eridani system. 

Several incidents have occurred between supporters of Shadow President Jerome Archer and Senator Denton Patreus of the Empire. The former group blames the latter for trying to subvert Federal governance of the system. 

Vox Galactica spoke to a representative for Jerome Archer’s power base in Chi Eridani: 

“Recent interactions with these Imperial troublemakers have been challenging, to say the least. But we didn't expect them to flood the system in such large numbers! As such they should be treated as a hostile invading force. Patreus’s proxy squadrons must be driven out to solidify Jerome Archer’s position as the key figurehead of Chi Eridani.” 

Meanwhile, a representative of the Imperial agents also provided a statement: 

“Federal political complacency is to blame for growing calls for the Empire’s grace. Denton Patreus is a man of honour and discipline - traits the Federation often lacks. We simply intended to demonstrate how effective a strong inspiration can be, but came under attack from Archer’s mob. We have the right to defend ourselves.” 

Both factions have called for combat pilots to sign up to the ongoing conflict: 

Jerome Archer supporters can register at Steve Masters starport. 

Denton Patreus supporters can register at the Evanescent Dusk megaship.
