* Imperial Forces Target Delaine Flagship

/12 Jun 3311/

An Imperial strike force has launched a surprise assault against the Archon Delaine’s flagship, the Mictlan, in what many are calling a long-awaited act of retribution. 

The offensive took place in the Beta-3 Tucani system, where Delaine is believed to have attended a gathering of notorious underworld figures. Witnesses reported intense fighting around the Mictlan, with Imperial vessels engaging both the pirate dreadnought and its escorts. 

Casualty reports are unconfirmed, but several pirate affiliated ships were destroyed or forced to flee. 

A brief statement from Emperor Arissa’s spokesperson confirmed Imperial involvement: 

“Let this serve as an answer to the provocations of August last year. Those who threaten the Emperor or her citizens will be dealt with using proportionate force.” 

The attack appears to be a response to Archon Delaine’s boasts following previous assassination attempts on Emperor Arissa and Shadow President Jerome Archer in August last year. Analysts have noted the precision of the strike suggests long-term infiltration and planning by Imperial Intelligence. 

A Kumo Council broadcast released hours later claimed: “We expected a response. What we didn’t expect was how long it took. The Empire’s blade is sharp, but slow. The next move is ours.” 

Security analysts now warn that more open conflict between Imperial and Kumo Council forces may follow. Delaine is said to be furious at the attack and has directed the Mictlan to lead an assault on Imperial forces in Beta-3 Tucani.

Delaine’s Kumo Council are summoning supporters to the Mictlan megaship.
