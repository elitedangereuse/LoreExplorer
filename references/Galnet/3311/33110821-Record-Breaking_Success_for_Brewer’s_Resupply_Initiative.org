* Record-Breaking Success for Brewer’s Resupply Initiative

/21 Aug 3311/

Brewer Corporation has confirmed the overwhelming success of its latest initiative to restock Trailblazer megaships, citing it as the largest single delivery effort in its history with independent pilots transporting more than 1,200,000,000 tonnes of materials. 

The campaign followed closely on the heels of two community-led operations that saw the Panther Clipper Mk II heavy freighter enter full-scale production. 

Brewer’s logistical network, already stretched by unprecedented colonisation projects, received a major boost from the resupply drive, whilst pilots also ensured the resupply routes remained safe from pirate interference across Minerva. 

Brewer COO Mark Rennik stated “Never before have we seen such a scale of commitment from the pilot community. This historic achievement not only met our needs, but it also far surpassed them.” 

The Trailblazer colonisation supply ships, which had suffered significant stock shortages, have now been replenished and are once again ready to supply humanity’s continued expansion outwards. Brewer Corporation has confirmed that ships will remain in their original strategic positions, as follows: 

Trailblazer Dream - HIP 90578 

Trailblazer Song - Orgen 

Trailblazer Wish - Bletii 

Trailblazer Star - 34 Omicron Cephei 

Trailblazer Promise - Klikis 

Trailblazer Faith - Ngobe
