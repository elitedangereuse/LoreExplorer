/30 Oct 3311/

Zorgon Peterson has confirmed that the Panther Clipper has entered full production, with deliveries now commencing to shipyards across the core systems. 

Previously available through limited release, the Panther Clipper is widely regarded as the largest and most capable civilian freighter in history and has already become a fixture of the galaxy’s expanding trade and colonisation efforts. 

A Zorgon Peterson spokesperson remarked: 

“The Panther Clipper represents the pinnacle of large-scale transport engineering, meeting the demanding standards of long-range hauliers, corporate logistics and colonisation.” 

“The vessel’s hallmark feature remains its immense cargo capacity, exceeding 1,200 tonnes when fully optimised, along with compatibility with the advanced Mk II cargo rack system. We’re delighted to make the Panther Clipper available to all.” 

The Panther Clipper is now available for purchase at shipyards throughout the core systems.
