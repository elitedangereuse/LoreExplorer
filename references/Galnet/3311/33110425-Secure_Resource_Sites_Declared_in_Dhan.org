* Secure Resource Sites Declared in Dhan

/25 Apr 3311/

Independent pilots have helped eradicate large numbers of pirates in the Dhan system. 

Following an unusually high increase in piracy across the system’s many planetary rings, local security fleets and skilled freelancers worked to eliminate pirates and show criminals that it would be better for them to relocate. 

“Pirates are too foolish to give up a life on the wrong side of the law,” said Dhan Empire League head of security Harald Gomes. “It’s all they know, and all they’re good for. But while we can’t stamp out crime forever, we can at least send the message that Dhan isn’t an easy target. Attack our mining craft at your peril, ya lugheads!” 

Gutamaya, thought to have deployed observers to monitor use of its recently released Corsair craft during the conflict, is said to have been ‘very impressed’ by its craft’s performance and the anti-piracy response force in general. 

Participants that registered for the conflict can collect their rewards from Kidd Station.
