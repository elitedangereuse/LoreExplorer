* Pilots’ Federation to Receive HIP 87621 Access

/06 Nov 3311/

*Pilots’ Federation Alert* 

The Pilots’ Federation has confirmed that licensed Commanders will be granted access to the HIP 87621 system by October Consortium. 

The unexpected move has followed weeks of speculation surrounding HIP 87621, with growing interest from all three superpowers piling pressure on the megacorp. A spokesperson from within the Pilots’ Federation stated: 

“The continued delay from October Consortium to relinquish permit control has only created further tension between political and scientific communities. To assuage concerns over the type of research taking place in HIP 87621, we have been invited to grant access to the system to licensed Pilots’ Federation members." 

However, Lexi October, head of the October Consortium, was less cordial in her statement to Vox Galactica: 

“We have done nothing but preserve our discovery within HIP 87621 for security and scientific purposes. The continued encroachment of superpower and corporate interests sets a dangerous precedence that can only have a detrimental effect to other independent entities that have operate claimed systems.” 

“I hope that our decision to allow Commanders to enter this system is accepted as a sign of good faith. Our work is legal, ethical and in full accordance with all relevant interstellar directives regarding the study of local flora.” 

The Pilots’ Federation has advised that Commanders will be able to access HIP 87621 from 16:00 UGT on the 13th of November 3311.
