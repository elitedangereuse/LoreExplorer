This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica. 

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence: 

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,461 systems 

Rank 2: Aisling Duval - 1,436 systems 

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval – 1,366 systems 

Rank 4: Yuri Grom – 1,041 systems 

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui – 860 systems 

The largest increase in system influence belonged to Li Yong-Rui who can claim an additional 59 systems as supporters. 

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.
