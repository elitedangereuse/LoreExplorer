* HIP 22460 Declared Free of Thargoids

/16 Jan 3311/

Aegis has confirmed that HIP 22460 shows zero sign of Thargoid activity following a blockade organised by AXI and XSF forces. 

It is theorised that the Thargoids have maintained a varying presence in the HIP 22460 system since at least 3303, due to reports recovered from the now-abandoned Fort Asch laboratory. After the Proteus Wave weapon in the system in 3308, Thargoids aggressively swarmed the system until recently. 

But AX forces sought to change this over the past few weeks, and the signal from Aegis’ military advisor Aden Tanner indicates that the system is now fully under human control. Tanner himself provided a message of thanks: 

“The impeccable efforts of AXI, XSF and allied AX pilots have finally brought peace to one more system. I only wish I was young enough to join these heroes out on the front lines. These pilots have provided a great service to humanity, and all here at Aegis salute them.”
