* Rackham Seeks Clues to HIP 87621 Mystery

/22 Sep 3311/

The Zachary Rackham-sponsored initiative to collect planetary scan data from across the galaxy has concluded. 

Rackham Capital Investments confirmed an ‘unprecedented volume of high-quality submissions’ from independent explorers. Pilots were tasked to scan worlds matching the classification of certain planets within the permit-locked HIP 87621 system, after long-range scans revealed unusual exobiological signatures. The findings are now being analysed by researchers sponsored by RCI. 

Zachary Rackham praised the pilot community for their efforts: 

“I knew the galaxy’s finest explorers wouldn’t let me down. Thanks to the staggering amount of data you’ve gathered, our scientific teams are already narrowing down what makes HIP 87621 so special. Let me tell you, we’re on the brink of cracking the mystery of that system. Won’t that be marvellous?” 

However, Federal Times journalist Bryanna Blanco, who for years has accused Rackham of being notorious pirate lord ‘Calico Zack’, suggested that the trillionaire’s reasons for funding this expedition are “flimsy at best.” 

“The motives for this exploration campaign are not to be trusted. Rackham is many things, but altruistic is not one of them.”
