* Mahon Gains Advantage in Alliance Trade Boom

/05 Jun 3311/

An aggressive trade war in Alliance space appears to have been won by supporters of Mahon. 

The recent withdrawal of Sirius Corporation from Allied military infrastructure created a significant opportunity for member state companies. The shipment of cargo to key locations has been used as a barometer of success between two trade blocs, formed around Edmund Mahon and Nakato Kaine respectively. 

After two weeks, the trade bloc favouring Mahon has been declared the winner by analysts and pundits. Irfan Karim of the Alliance Tribune noted that the Mahon trade bloc is ‘likely to secure the biggest and most lucrative contracts over the coming weeks.’ 

Participants in the trade war can now collect their rewards: 

Supporters of Edmund Mahon’s trade bloc can find their rewards at Bowersox Port in Winiama. 

Supporters of Nakato Kaine's trade bloc can find their rewards at Fuca Dock in Apura.
