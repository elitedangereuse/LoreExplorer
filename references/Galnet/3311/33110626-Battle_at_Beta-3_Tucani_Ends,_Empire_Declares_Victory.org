* Battle at Beta-3 Tucani Ends, Empire Declares Victory

/26 Jun 3311/

The conflict between Imperial forces and Archon Delaine in the Beta-3 Tucani system has concluded, with analysts confirming a clear victory for the Empire. 

The system became a flashpoint after Imperial Intelligence launched an operation aimed at weakening Delaine’s influence and driving the Mictlan megaship from the region. Both sides called upon independent pilots to support their efforts, resulting in widespread clashes across the system. 

Supporters of the Empire successfully repelled Delaine’s forces and dealt a severe blow to pirate operations in the system. Imperial Intelligence claimed success in its objective to force the Mictlan into retreat, though Delaine appears to have survived the assault. 

A spokesperson for Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duvall praised the outcome: 

“Every Commander who fought under an Imperial banner has helped deliver a sharp message to any would-be aggressor against the Empire. Emperor Arissa’s will has been realised in this system.” 

To add further insult, it was revealed that an Imperial agent had managed to infiltrate the Mictlan and hack the internal holoscreens to display Imperial propaganda prior to departure.
