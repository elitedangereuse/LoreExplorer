* October Consortium Defends Control of HIP 87621

/09 Oct 3311/

Lexi October, billionaire investor and head of the October Consortium, has issued a statement clarifying her organisation’s ownership of the HIP 87621 permit. 

“The October Consortium acquired system rights through all proper and legal channels over a decade ago,” October declared. “Our researchers are conducting a legitimate study of several planetary bodies. Any infringement upon these rights will be rigorously challenged through interstellar courts. Permit access is not granted lightly, nor will we tolerate attempts to undermine lawful operations.” 

October also questioned the intensity of media and scientific scrutiny directed at her organisation: 

“Zachary Rackham’s recent survey campaign enlisted thousands of independent pilots to scour the galaxy for planetary data. Yet Rackham has not shared the promised results with the scientific community – not a single piece of scan data. Why, then, is my organisation’s small research initiative attracting so much attention? Is it because we are not protected by the glamour of his former political ambition?” 

The October Consortium has so far declined to provide specifics regarding their discoveries within HIP 87621, citing ongoing studies and confidentiality agreements. October stressed that findings would be released at an unspecified date and conclusions should be drawn responsibly, rather than speculatively. 

At time of publication, HIP 87621 remains closed to independent access.
