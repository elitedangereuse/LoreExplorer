* Exobiologists Demand Answers as HIP 87621 Speculation Grows

/25 Sep 3311/

Leading voices in the exobiological community are demanding clarity on the fate of Terri Tora, the young researcher who recently went missing around HIP 87621. 

Professor Frank Raddix, who originally appealed for help in locating his young partner, issued a new statement this week: 

“Terri risked everything in pursuit of discovery. We deserve to know whether she is safe and what exactly she found. Continued silence from the authorities is unacceptable.” 

Independent journalist Alexei Keel of Vox Galactica has published evidence linking the permit lock to billionaire investor Lexi October. October Consortium, which predominantly deals in technology, gambling circles, and high-profile investments, refused to comment when approached. Lexi’s silence has fuelled intense speculation over whether her organisation is involved with controlling access to the system. 

Keel noted that the October Consortium’s resources would make it well-placed to secure influence over a site of potential scientific importance. Many now speculate that HIP 87621 contains valuable discoveries that have been secured for private interests. 

Keel also pressed representatives of the Empire, Federation, and Alliance, and while each denied any connection to HIP 87621’s permit or the whereabouts of Terri Torra, he did note that they were following developments closely.
