* Mystery Of Missing Exobiology Protégé Deepens

/02 Sep 3311/

A recent hunt for maverick exobiology scientist Terri Tora has only deepened the mystery surrounding her disappearance. 

The search began after Professor Frank Raddix issued an appeal to locate his missing colleague, who was last reported pursuing “something big” for the science community. An encrypted trail of messages led search pilots across multiple systems, piecing together encrypted comms data. Thousands participated, ultimately confirming Tora’s final location at HIP 87621, a permit locked system. 

Speculation about the system is rife as no third party or superpower has claimed ownership of the permit lock, leading to rumours about its true significance and why access has been restricted for so long. 

Professor Raddix issued the following statement after the discovery of Tora’s last known location: “My thanks go to the many pilots who answered my call. Terri’s trail has led us somewhere we have never been able to access before. Why is access to this system restricted? Who operates the permit? And what discovery did Terri make that beyond this cloak of secrecy?” 

A spokesperson for the October Consortium responded to calls regarding the presence of two of its megaships, stating that a routine survey expedition was occurring in the region. It denied knowing anything regarding Tora’s current whereabouts. 

As one mystery has been answered more questions are raised, with ICE-casters and opinion piece authors demanding to know what lies within HIP 87621 and where Terri Tora is now.
