* Brewer Corporation to Fund Survey Initiative

/30 Jan 3311/

A new planetary survey initiative has been announced by Brewer Corporation, calling for pilots to scan locations around the core systems. 

Following the recent deployment of the megaship Trailblazer Echo, CEO Madelyn Teague made the following announcement from the megaship’s bridge: 

“Recent events have accelerated plans to explore a new age of system colonisation efforts. Brewer Corporation has proudly supported ambitious projects such as the Colonia Bridge, and worked with other corporations to improve and increase starports across the galaxy. Now we take another step forward in the continued march across the stars.” 

“Universal Cartographics has partnered with us to collect, analyse and process the very latest exploration data, to help calibrate our metrics for optimal colonisation targets.” 

Brewer Corporation, which constructs Coriolis and Orbis starports, has supported localised expansion efforts in the past. But, until today, it had given shareholders no sign that it would endorse widespread colonisation plans. 

Some media analysts have claimed that Brewer Corporation has been in significant talks with superpower lobbyists in recent weeks, which could explain the change of heart. The level of influence the superpowers had on this announcement is unconfirmed. 

Explorers who wish to contribute to the initiative can hand in exploration data to the Trailblazer Echo in the HIP 90578 system. Contributions will be valued by thoroughness, with full FSS scans and planetary probing completions rewarded higher.
