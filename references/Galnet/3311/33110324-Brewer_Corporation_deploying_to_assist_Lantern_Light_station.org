* Brewer Corporation deploying to assist Lantern Light station

/24 Mar 3311/

An unusual and turbulent situation has arisen for residents of the station Lantern Light in the Lalande 25224 system. The architect, CMDR Lavelain, commissioned the station nearby a neutron star. However, the station was inadvertently deployed deep within the star’s gravitational well. As a result, the station’s movement and rotational speeds far exceed safe limits – time should be taken for caution when attempting docking. 

Brewer Corporation has received numerous requests for support from the station’s residents and is mobilising to correct the station’s violent and turbulent movement. The operation is currently undergoing careful planning to ensure the orbit is not destabilized further into catastrophe, and is expected to take several weeks to accomplish.
