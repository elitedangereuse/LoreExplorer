* Pilots’ Federation Members Enter HIP 87621

/13 Nov 3311/

*Pilots’ Federation Alert* 

The Pilots’ Federation has confirmed that members are now authorised to enter the HIP 87621 system, following months of speculation and political wrangling. 

This unprecedented decision grants exclusive access to licensed Commanders, with civilian, corporate and government organisations still restricted from entering the system. 

October Consortium officials explained apparent inconsistencies between previously available system data and actual astrometric data as “spoofing”, citing “security and scientific integrity” as major reasons. They have also confirmed placing a permanent exclusion on fleet carriers entering the system under the same basis. 

Scientists believe the plant’s unusual biological markers may explain the long-range scan anomalies that first drew attention to the system. 

Commanders who have already ventured into HIP 87621 report the discovery of an exobiological flora unlike any previously catalogued. As a result, October Consortium has now issued a call for exobiological scan data to help with further scientific analysis. 

The Pilots’ Federation has encouraged all licensed members to support this initiative by conducting on-site surveys and delivering complete exobiology data scans to Vista Genomics at the Exogene Sciences asteroid base. 

They have also issued a cautionary warning that the plant has so far only been found thriving on hot planets with thin atmospheres, so appropriate gear must be always worn to ensure protection.
