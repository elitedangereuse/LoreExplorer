* Anti-Xeno Blockade Contains HIP 22460

/10 Jan 3311/

A squadron of AX pilots have planned to sustain pressure on the lingering Thargoid presence in the HIP 22460 system. 

Led by the respected AXI and XSF combat fleets, the blockade seeks to push Thargoid craft from the area from January 12th. 

HIP 22460 was the staging ground for Salvationâ€™s Proteus Wave weapon, which sought to end the Second Thargoid War in August 3308 but resulted in disaster. Prior to this it is believed to have hosted several clandestine research operations hosted by Azimuth Biochemicals and protected by the notorious Black Flight.
