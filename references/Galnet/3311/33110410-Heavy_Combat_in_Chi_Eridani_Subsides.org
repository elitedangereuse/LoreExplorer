A proxy conflict between supporters of Jerome Archer and Denton Patreus appears to be slowing down after several days of sustained fighting. 

Battlefield reporters for the Chi Eridani Herald state that the Jerome Archer group emerged victorious, scoring a higher number of confirmed victories in the area. 

A spokesperson for Jerome Archer provided the following to the Herald: 

“It's obvious that this outcome proves the strong influence and military might of Jerome Archer’s supporters in Chi Eridani. Hopefully this leads to a widespread acceptance of the benefits and protection that Archer’s leadership can bring to the system.” 

Those who took part in the conflict for either side can now collect their rewards. 

Jerome Archer supporters can collect their rewards at Steve Masters starport. 

Denton Patreus supporters can collect their rewards at the Evanescent Dusk megaship.
