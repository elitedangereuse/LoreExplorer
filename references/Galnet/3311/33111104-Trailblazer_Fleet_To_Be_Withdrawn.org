* Trailblazer Fleet To Be Withdrawn

/04 Nov 3311/

Brewer Corporation has announced plans to reassign its Trailblazer megaship fleet, citing the self-sufficiency of newly established colonies. 

The Trailblazer vessels were deployed to provide logistical support and essential resources to independent colonisation initiatives at the edge of inhabited space. Their presence has been credited with accelerating the construction of ports and surface settlements throughout the past year. 

Mark Rennik, Chief Operating Officer for Brewer Corporation, issued a statement of commendation: 

“What began as an ambitious expansion effort has grown into a thriving network of independent colonies. The success of these initiatives proves that humanity’s frontier is now strong enough to stand on its own.” 

“With these colonies self-sustaining and prospering, the Trailblazer fleet’s mission is complete. Markets will close initially as we funnel Brewer Corporation stocks that have supplied them to other projects. The ships will then jump to new locations at a later date.” 

Withdrawal operations will begin Tuesday, 11th November, 3311.
