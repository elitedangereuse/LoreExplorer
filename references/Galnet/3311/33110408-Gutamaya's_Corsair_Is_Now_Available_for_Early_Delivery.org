* Gutamaya's Corsair Is Now Available for Early Delivery

/08 Apr 3311/

The initial production run of Gutamaya’s new Corsair ships has been deployed to much fanfare, with a flurry of adverts targeting early consumers. 

In a statement marking the occasion, Gutamaya's lead engineer Ines Allende remarked: 

 "Today marks a significant milestone for Gutamaya. The Corsair blends our customary elegant design with exceptional multipurpose capability, fulfilling the diverse demands of modern pilots." 

“With a balanced hardpoint configuration, substantial cargo capacity, powerful thrusters and four utility slots, this vessel adapts beautifully for trading, combat, and exploration roles.” 

The Corsair is Gutamaya’s first commercially available multirole ship which forgoes any Imperial Navy rank requirement. It offers versatility in a medium-sized ship classification, making it viable for trading with outposts inaccessible to larger Imperial vessels. 

Princess Aisling Duval, present at Gutamaya’s launch event in Capitol, expressed satisfaction with the Corsair's reception: "This magnificent ship represents the Empire's commitment to innovation, while honoring our people’s aesthetic tastes. I am in awe of Gutamaya’s continued dedication to excellence and will be adding a Corsair to my personal fleet." 

The Corsair is available for exclusive purchase initially and will transition to standard shipyard inventories at a later date.
