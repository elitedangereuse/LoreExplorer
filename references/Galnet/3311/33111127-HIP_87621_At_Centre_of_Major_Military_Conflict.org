* HIP 87621 At Centre of Major Military Conflict

/27 Nov 3311/

Exobiological data delivered to Exogene Sciences in HIP 87621 have confirmed that a new species of flora with unique properties has been discovered on several bodies. 

Allied, Imperial, Federal and Independent Powers have now deployed fleets to secure control of the enclave surrounding HIP 87621 following the discovery of Radicoida unica, with reports of the rival powers clashing in open combat across the region. 

Speculation has ignited over why this flora, which has rumoured to exhibit unique bio-chemical properties during analysis, has inspired such aggressive action by all Powers. Political analysts have noted that this is the most significant military mobilisation since the Second Thargoid War. 

A spokesperson for Denton Patreus stated: “Imperial interests cannot allow rivals to dictate the future of HIP 87621. Order must be maintained, and only Imperial governance has the authority to do so.” 

By contrast, a Nakato Kaine staff member said: “Members of the Alliance will not sit idle while bullies seek to snatch a legally claimed system by force. We will defend equal access and resist attempts at domination.” 

Federal and assorted independent Powers have also issued adversarial statements, respectively framing their involvement as necessary to protect their interests or preserve freedom from superpower control. 

Military analysts have suggested they expect this military campaign to last months with the goal to occupy the 49-system enclave surrounding HIP 87621, securing exclusive control over Radicoida unica as the primary objective. Whichever power succeeds will likely be the first to benefit from the applications of this new discovery. 

Each power has issued a call to arms to their pledged pilots, and two-week initiatives have begun to open their respective campaigns.
