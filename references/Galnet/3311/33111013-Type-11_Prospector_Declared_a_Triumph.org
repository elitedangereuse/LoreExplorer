* Type-11 Prospector Declared a Triumph

/13 Oct 3311/

Lakon Spaceways has praised the success of its sponsored mining trials for the Type-11 Prospector, praising independent pilots who flew them. 

Engineers reported that the data gathered has exceeded expectations, with the Prospector’s custom mining systems maintaining consistent, high-yield results. 

A Lakon senior design engineer, who oversaw the trial, stated: 

“The feedback from pilots has been very positive. The Prospector’s unique hardpoint configuration and enhanced limpet systems are proving themselves in real mining conditions. We built this ship to be one of the best surface mining vessels you can buy, and these trials have shown that it is exactly that.” 

Several pilots involved in the campaign described the vessel as “ripping through asteroids with ease”, praising its ability to produce unprecedented fragment yields. The feedback is also welcomed by the news of a permanent 8% boost to the existing Squadron mining perk, adding further incentive for independent miners to seek out likeminded pilots and form a squadron of their own. 

With the trial concluded, Lakon confirmed that the Type-11 Prospector will eventually move from early release into wider distribution across the galaxy’s shipyards. Analysts predict the ship will be frequently utilised for deep space mining operations, cementing Lakon’s place as the premier manufacturer of industrial starships.
