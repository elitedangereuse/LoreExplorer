* Megaship Movements Spark HIP 87621 Speculation

/23 Oct 3311/

Independent observers have reported unusual activity in systems surrounding HIP 87621, intensifying rumours of covert operations in the region. 

Multiple reports indicate that megaships have been spotted operating near the permit-locked system over the past week. Though no Power has formally acknowledged involvement, analysts believe this early mobilisation suggests a push for influence around HIP 87621. 

Access to the system itself remains under permit lock. All independent colonisation requests for the surrounding area continue to be denied with no reasons cited. Conrad Sterling, a political correspondent for Vox Galactica, noted: 

“Typically, when you see megaships mobilising on this scale it usually precedes territorial stakes being claimed. None of the Powers have formally announced such plans but pilots continue to report receiving private messages from their pledged Power representatives indicating each have a vested interest in whatever HIP 87621 is hiding.”
