* Winters' Supporters Claim Mining Rush Victory

/15 May 3311/

A surprisingly tense mining boom in LP 855-34 has concluded, with supporters of Felicia Winters claiming success over Yuri Grom’s pilots. 

A call for Platinum by the system’s governing faction triggered an influx of ships representing the two powers. Longstanding issues between Yuri Grom and the Federation fed into the competitive aspect of the issue, and it is perhaps no surprise that it was the latter who claimed the greatest number of mined resources in the end. 

Speaking on behalf of Winters’ support base, a representative gave this statement: 

“The efforts of our mining teams over the past two weeks have been nothing short of remarkable. We provided enough Platinum to ensure that LP 855-34’s governing faction will meet its manifesto building projects. And, just as significantly, we showed that the Federation dominates all competitors in matters of industry!” 

Those who took part in the conflict for either side can now collect their rewards. 

Felicia Winters supporters can collect their rewards at Rhea's Resilience. 

Yuri Grom supporters can collect their rewards at The Undeniable.
