* Enclave Standings: 19th December

/19 Dec 3311/

This week’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the enclave has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica. 

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence: 

Rank 1: A. Lavigny-Duval - 7 Systems 

Rank 2: Aisling Duval - 6 Systems 

Rank 3: Pranav Antal - 5 Systems 

Rank 4: Nakato Kaine - 4 Systems 

Rank 5: Yuri Grom - 3 Systems 

Zemina Torval has lost her foothold in the enclave and is now eliminated from contention for control of the region. The remaining powers fight to cling on to their current systems as the battle continues.
