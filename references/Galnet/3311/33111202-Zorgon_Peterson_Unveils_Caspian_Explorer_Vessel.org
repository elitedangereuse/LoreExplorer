* Zorgon Peterson Unveils Caspian Explorer Vessel

/02 Dec 3311/

Zorgon Peterson has announced the limited release of the Caspian Explorer, a large vessel purpose-built for deep space and planetary exploration. 

Designed from the keel up as an exploration platform, the Caspian Explorer forgoes the “jack of all trades” compromise of many large ship options. Zorgon Peterson claims the Caspian Explorer is an elite choice for deep space voyages: “a dedicated large explorer that outpaces competitors in exploration performance, manoeuvrability and planetary operations while offering jump capability to match the needs of far-reaching expeditions.” 

Key features setting the Caspian Explorer apart include new Mk II exploration modules, improved landing thrusters that halve gravity influence on high-G worlds, and advanced thermal shielding for faster, steeper atmospheric entries. The ship also comes with a Mk II SCO-enabled frame shift drive that increases neutron jump boosts to 500% and white dwarf boosts to 200%. 

A Zorgon Peterson spokesperson said: “The Caspian Explorer was created to push the boundaries of what a large explorer can do. It is focused, refined and optimised for the role of discovery. For Commanders who make exploration their life’s work, this ship will feel like it was built just for them.” 

To test the new Caspian’s exploration capabilities, Zorgon Peterson has called for independent pilots to help gather exploration data on exobiological organisms found throughout the galaxy. All interested explorers and exobiologists should head to Reorte and register at Davies High before heading out into the black. 

The Caspian Explorer is available now as an early-release purchase and will later transition to wider shipyard availability.
