* Independent Colonisation Support Campaign Goes Live

/20 Feb 3311/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Brewer Corporation has issued a request for deliveries to Starlace Station in the Minerva system. 

Brewer COO Mark Rennik is overseeing the second open request by the corporation in a month, following calls for system survey data earlier this month. Rennik’s press release, published through most major news feeds, offered an update on Brewer’s broader colonisation plans. 

An excerpt highlighted by Vox Galactica: 

“A key feature of independent colonisation plans is the beacon and suite module used to establish a successful claim. Our secure manufacturing facilities across several systems have been producing considerable stocks of these devices ready to supply outfitters.” 

“This morning, we held talks with representatives of minor factions on the fringes of populated space. It was suggested – and we agreed - that the initial colonisation efforts carried out with Brewer technology could benefit from mobile market support.” 

“I have therefore commissioned new additions to the Trailblazer megaship fleet, which will aid in supplying early colony claims. To ensure these megaships are ready for service and sufficiently stocked on time, we call for independent traders to bring specific commodities to Minerva so we can meet our planned two-week deadline.” 

A number of commodities have been requested by Brewer Logistics, the logistical arm of Brewer Corporation, which are detailed within the initiative. Following a recent security incident, a secondary initiative to protect traders in the Minerva system is also underway, with contributions measured in bounty vouchers.
