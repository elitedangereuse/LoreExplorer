0113	Alliance Assembly	Alioth	4,580 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Alliance Assembly is the central body for the Alliance as a whole. While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the 21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. In main it functions as a means for establishing common policies and treaties rather than laws. / It also acts as an arbitration body between member states and depending on Assembly votes can enforce sanctions or corrective measures. However the politics of the member states often makes this a tricky process.
0114	Alliance Defence Force	Alioth	2,305 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Barring the small Alliance Defence Force for defending key components of the Alliance bureaucracy there is no central Alliance Navy to compare with the other major powers. Instead a headquarters organisation exists staffed by the Council of Admirals and their support staff. / The Alliance Defence Force is essentially a small rapid deployment force made up of ships from the member navies, and is maintained under the command of the Council of Admirals to respond to any crisis - humanitarian and military. / In an emergency additional forces would be provided by member navies if the Council of Admirals makes an emergency appeal to the Assembly.
0115	Alioth History	Alioth	1,238 ls	Series 1	Elite History	After the war between Achenar and the Federation concluded in 2380, the Federation looked to find new resources elsewhere. In 2398, the first of a new wave of colonial missions was sent to the outermost sectors in the opposite direction to the Empire and Lave. / Alioth was colonised in 2452. Survey data and reports had already indicated the rich resources of the system before settlement, but the resources proved richer than expected. / The first colonial settlement in the system was known as 'Fruitcake', the name given owing to the loamy consistency of the planetary surface and its propensity for small mineral deposits.
0116	Alliance Council Members	Alioth	4,836 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Each Alliance Member State has a number of Council Members within the Alliance Assembly, based on the size of their respective populations. Some only have one. The Prime Minister is elected by the Members, and it is his or her job to corral them into some sort of consensus; generally a slow process. There is much less tradition than in the other powers, and processes within the Alliance Assembly are still subject to change - generally when arguments break out, as they frequently do. In practice the Alliance is largely run by Civil Servants - salaried officials that look after day to day running of the Alliance, generally not getting involved in the political struggles. / The Alliance Defence Force is run by the six member Council of Admirals, independently from the Council of Members, but reporting to it after the event, to facilitate rapid decision-making. Each of the Admirals is from a key contributing Navy.
0117	Everichon Hijack	Alioth	12,657 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2559, the tourist liner Everichon, full of Imperial nobles, was hijacked by a Caker group who planned to crash it into one of the gas giants. The attempt was thwarted by Imperial commandoes. The holo-vid broadcast and subsequent fictional dramatisation 'Rebel Madness', went some way to diverting popular opinion from the insurrection.
0118	Tom Quaterson Death	Alioth	4,580 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Having smuggled weapons into the system, the tension between the Cakers and the authorities was always going to spill over eventually. In 2617, the death of Tom Quaterson, a munitions worker who had been convicted of selling food coupons to the poor, was the spark that lit the flame of revolt. Workers on the gas platforms seized control of the facilities and planetside, the general populace stormed the Governor's residence. / Quentin Deviseses wasn't just a revolutionary. He had a long term strategy for the system and as soon as the planet was secure, used every means he could to get the word out that Alioth would become a free trade port. / The resource implication of Alioth's independence was too much for either the Empire or the Federation to take.
0119	Caker Coup	Alioth	2,276 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2853, the science research outpost of Nesbitt Landing was founded. Initially this was to be a joint venture between the Empire and Federation, but when a detailed study into the genetic problems on New California linked the issue with the terraforming of the planet in 2612, the Imperials withdrew from the project. / The matter remained a local issue until, in 2854, responding to pressure from Achenar, Imperial soldiers instigated martial law and attempted to impose a genetic correction programme on the planet. This was precented by a coup against the military garrison by a new Caker sect. Within days, the planet had been secured and an appreal was sent to the Federation for assistance. / A fierce battle ensued; Imperial forces from the orbital refineries began a planetary bombardment, but the arrival of a Federal fleet escalated the conflict. Eventually, the Imperial ships pulled back and Admiral Kracer landed with his marines to cheering crowds in the capital. Kracer retired three years later, settling in New California and later became the colony leader.
0120	Riley Dain Murder	Alioth	4,689 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 3184, the election of Federation President Loric Trander saw a renewal of hostilities over Alioth. This time, conflict was instigated by corporate rivalry in the system's vast gas mining sector. After the discovery of a murdered official named Riley Dain who was investigating the abuse of permitted quotas, the situation quickly escalated. Trander authorised a force off privateers. In response Hesketh Duval sent in the Imperial XV fleet. / The conflict avoided the settlement of New California, owing to the previous treaty, but the settlers there found themselves all but cut off until a further ceasefire was established in 3198. Neither side achieved anything but line the pockets of the industries who fuelled and powered their fleets. It also served to stir further resentment amongst the settlers. At this time, the Caker insurrection became more organised and received substantial financial support from unknown sources.
0121	Mic Turner History	Alioth	4,836 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Born in 3205, Mic Turner grew up in Jones Colony in the Essafa system. After graduating with honours from the civilian Pilots school, he moved to New California in Alioth, just before the rebellion started. / In 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying New California attempted to raise their prices again, the citizens revolted, taking over the ships berthed in the space station and riding out to the gas mining station to assault the corporate workers. Federal and Imperial forces arrived within days, but fighters from Alioth and several neighbouring independent systems joined forces to repel them. / Turner's pilot skills saw him amongst the first to fly out to the orbital platforms and he won a great deal of respect from his peers for his efforts. It was here the met Meredith Argent, a scientiest who led one of the Caker cells on the gas platforms and was direct descendant of Walter Argent, a wealthy industrial from Ayethi in the the 27th century. Argent and Turner were to become partners for life.
0122	Reorte Reclaimed	Reorte	7 ls	Series 1	Elite History	"After three weeks of fighting in the Lave Cluster, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps (AEDC) managed to reclaim Reorte from a pirate insurgency.

0124	Gateway History	Gateway	299 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Gateway was originally known as Oltiqu, but renamed when the Alliance was founded in 3230. The system had originally been under Federation jurisdiction after being colonised in 2473 to be used as a military staging area for a further invasion of Alioth. Over time, the military bases became more permanent colonies and settlements. The system achievend full federal membership in 2561, but remained relatively unimportant and in the shadow of Alioth for many centuries. / When Alioth finally achieved independence in 3230, Oltiqu might have been a place where the Federation forces could rally and return. However a coordinated peaceful coup by sympathetic federal officials allowed the system to be united under the banner of the Alliance.
0125	Holiacan History	Holiacan	73 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Relatively late to joining the original Alliance group in 3244, Holiacan was not contested by Federation forces as the systems assets were relatively small. The bloodless revolution is a complete contrast to its partner and robotic manufacturing rival Alioth, whose industry in this area had been expanded into the system in 3229. / Since this time, robotics manufacturing and output within the Holiacan has increased. Several other prominent political figures in Alliance politics have emerged from this system, most notably Lucinda Kallis, who wields considerable influence amongst the system group.
0126	Indaol History	Indaol	43 ls	Series 1	Elite History	This minor system in notable only because of its early membership of the Alliance, joining in 3232. This membership granted the colonists significant technological improvement on their existing lot.
0127	Olgrea History	Olgrea	2,938 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Mic Turner, the intergalactic Explorer, ship designer and founder of the Alliance, led the Federation expenditionary team tha brought colonists to Olgrea in 3224. \ Terraforming operations began almost immediately as the Federation could see that further population growth in the region would require room to accommodate. \ In 3239, Alliance warships and Turner's command return to the system and after a short altercation with Federal forces won control of Fortress Jung and New Casablanca. After this it was only a matter of time before the rest of the system surrendered and the Federation withdrew. \ By 3250, the Olgrea system had become a massive part of the Alliance infrastructure. The Planet New Gotham became the centre of agricultural production for the entire Alliance sector. The system population had grown to approach 100 million inhabitants, one of the fastest system migrations in interstellar history.
0128	Origins of the Empire	Achenar	20,660 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The origins of the Empire date back to the colonisation of the Achenar system in the middle of the 23rd century. Marlin Duval was a wealthy woman from Earth, who, disenchanted with their administration and authorities, set off with her own colonising fleet to Achenar 6d because it was so far from Earth. Her leadership ended abruptly when her brother Henson oversaw a flying 'accident' in which she perished. The democratic government changed abruptly to one of strict imperial rule and from then on the family assumed leadership. Female children in the family were prevented with genetic techniques, such was the hatred of Marlin Duval's principles and vision of a world in peace. This restriction was gradually phased out over the years, but the succession of Emperors has remained along the male line until recently.
0129	War with the Federation	Achenar	20,812 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Achenar drew the irritation of the Federation at the start of 2323, when reports reached Earth that the colonists had wiped out a sentient race on the planet. This, coupled with the refusal of Achenar to become a member, caused the Federation to send a battle group to take control of the system by force. / The fleet eventually arrived in the Achenar system at the start of 2324. Gathered intelligence meant the Imperial forces ambushed the Federal forces as they jumped into the system. What they hadn't predicted was the enemy to use their pack hunting formation against them.
0130	Failed Invasion	Achenar	202,593 ls	Series 1	Elite History	For the rest of 2324. Federation ships tried to establish a beach head in the furthest reaches of the system, but with no breathable atmosphere amongst the far planets, they struggled to maintain for the war effort. / Eventually in 2325 Henson Duval decided Federal forces had been weakened sufficiently to strike. Achenar's own small fleet was mobilised, the Duval family commandeering nearly every vessel in the system to fall upon the weakened Federal forces where they clustered on the edge of the system. This became know as the Great Battle of Liberation.
0131	Hall of Martyrs	Achenar	20,660 ls	Series 1	Elite History	At the end of the war, in the great palace of the Duvals on Capitol, Henson Duval ordered a great hall to be filled with obsidian pillars. These unadorned blocks of black stone represent each brave soul who has died for Achenar. Sixteen thousand and thrity two pillars were constructed for its opening in 2381. this tomb remains underneath the Imperial palace on Capitol.

At the promise of substantial financial reward a battlegroup was assembled to respond. / Officially, the appointed leader of this flotilla, one Samuel Lanner, was an independent trader and privateer. / The clash between the Federation and Lanner's forces remained limited and the Federal fleet withdrew to Laveack. The Rockforth Corporation paid up as promised and signed a contract with Lanner's privateers to guarantee the defence of the system.
0133	Lanner's Victory	Ackwada	490 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Seven years later, in 2872 the fleet returned. A clash with Lanner's forces resulted in a stalemate. Using Anaconda transports and Cobra Mark I's, Lanner was able to outmanoeuvre the larger Federal battle group, forcing another retreat. In 2873, Lanner was summoned back to Achenar, Records indicate he departed from Ackwada, but he was never heard from again. A memorial stone was erected in the Hall of Martyrs in his honour.
0134	Wrekcht's Raid	Andceeth	496 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2913, former Imperial Commander Maximillian Wrekcht attempted to raid the banking vaults on the Trouble in the Andceeth system. Whilst Wrekcht was a retired Commander of the Fifth Imperial fleet, his actions under an Imperial letter of marque left no doubts to his affiliation. Working from an Imperial cruiser with a prototype engine mask, Wrekcht's audacious attempt to bombard the planet with asteroids was foiled by Federal defence forces. He was believed to have died in the ensuing battle.
0135	Battlegroup's Disappearance	Alioth	1,242 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2924, a further conflict started up in the Alioth system, initiated by a squabble over its hydrocarbon resources. The Durn and Resnar Corporation applied for Imperial assistance to enforce its claim over a large swathe of the system's mining rights.

They vastly outnumbered the mustered Federal units, and forced them out of the entire system within a year. But then, withouth warning in 2925, the Imperial battle group disappeared. Federal vessels returned and Hassoni-Kruger appropriated the system's mining rights. Within month all assets of the Durn and Resner Corporation were seized by the Emperor. The reson for the strange events has never been discovered. Federal intelligence sources were later to accuse the Duvals of instigating a cloning programme to breed specialised infantry units.
0136	Genetic Research Cleansed	Fawaol	1,048 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2934, acting on the information of concerned locals, Imperial forces arrived in the Fawaol system to wipe out the experimental genetic research facilities of the Darious Foundation.
0137	The Empire's Loss	Zeessze	490 ls	Series 1	Elite History	in 2942, New America in the Zeessze system revolted over the harsh working conditions imposed more than a century before. Suprisingly the Imperial fleet was not deployed and the system gradually reverted to Federation rule.
0138	Olban's Succession	Liaedin	2,164 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2943, at the age of one hundred and fourteen, Trasken Duval III died. His son Olban Hensard Duval succeeded him. / Olban's first action on the interstellar political stage marked a different approach to his father. Imperial involvement in the disputes in the Liaedin system, beginning in 2945, were subtle rather then heavy-handed.
0139	Olban's Diplomacy	Zeaex	301 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Further evidence of Olban Duval's subtle approach occured in 2951 when the Empire elected to act through agents in the Zeaex system, empowering Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining right with Grambourne Cambridge of the Federeation.
0140	The Emperor's Own	Laedla	408 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Emperor's willingness to use force was proven when in 2959, an Imperial strike force invaded the Laedla system and overwhelmed the Federation garrison on Mansfield on 'Lighting Thursday'. This was the first recorded deployment of 'The Emperor's Own', an elite military corps.
0141	Yorkville Patriots	Ackwada	2,044 ls	Series 1	Elite History	in 2974, the Federation pushed further. Another invasion began in the Ackwada system. This time, instead of sending a 'privateer' battlegroup, the Empire supllied ships and equipment directly to the system's residents. The 'Yorkville Partriots' rose up and defeated the Federation fleet six weeks after they arrived.
0142	Ashfield's Death	Zeaex	207 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2976, the death of Francis Ashfield in the Zeaex system, allegedly at the hands of Federal assassins, prompted only the second major military assembly of Olban Hensard Duval's reign. However, conflict was averted when the settlers of Newtown in the system sent a personal appeal to both the Federation and the Empire, which resolved the matter of mining rights and established an uneasy truce.
0143	Gaylen's Ascension	Quince	2,068 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The ascension of Gaylen Trasken Duval was marked with chaotic celebrations in the Achenar and Quince systems. With a new Emperor on the throne, the Imperial political agenda changed again. Gaylen proved to ma more prickly and temperamental character than his predecessor. Hostilities at Alioth were renewed in 2994, whilst a Federation  supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial backed forces in 2996.
0144	Imperial Palace Expands	Achenar	42,370 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Gaylen Trasken Duval's first act as Emperor, was to expand the Imperial palace on Capitol, transforming the building into the glowing pink glass structure we know today. To complete his vision, the Emperor hired thousands of the galaxy's best designers and architects to work on the structure. The result is one of the great manufactured interstellar marvels of our age.
0145	Terraforming	Cemiess		Series 1	Elite History	The Emperor's passion for the arts and very high standards of living saw a rapid population increase in Imperial systems. Massive migration from independent, Galcop and Federation worlds saw an accompanying increase in prosperity. \ To deal with the rapid rise in population across many worlds, the Empire began terraforming of Cemiess 2 in 3080. This put paid to Federal ambitions in the system. A colonial charter had been established since 3055, but lack of funds had prevented any expansion. The act of approving the Imperial settlement proved to be the last of Gaylen Trasken Duval who dies shortly afterwards, he was 109 years of age.
0146	Atticus Ascension	Exioce		Series 1	Elite History	Atticus Obellan Duval ascended to the Imperial throne in 3081. His arrival triggered noticeably less celebration and the man's dour and bitter countenance was quickly noted as a contrast to the theatrically inclined Gaylen. In 3082 a second mission was sent to Exioce, terraforming the planet Experiment and establishing a permanent presence there, putting an end to Federal ambitions in the system.
0147	Faveol Hostilities	Liaedin	344 ls	Series 1	Elite History	3094 saw an outbreak of further hostilities in the Liadedin system. The Faveol family offered a substantive financial investment to the Empire if it would intervene in in continual dispute with the Blossom family over a specific territorial issue.
0148	Governor Santorini's Assassination	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 3098 Governor Santorini of Tau Ceti was assassinated. Popular Federal press sources pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several quotes from 'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an imperial target. Unusually, the Emperor elected to make a personal rebuttal of the accusation, but three years later, Imperial colonists escorted by Imperial warships, settled on Emeral. The Federation responded by sending Admiral O'Biren with a heavily armed battlegroup, who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over the next thirty years, botn sides would battle to gain control of the planet and the system.
0149	Military Base Established	Facece		Series 1	Elite History	In 3104 a permanent military training base was established on Peter's Wreck in the Facece system. Facece had always been known for its strong support and commitment to training the Empire's finest, but the dedicated base signalled a new fervour for military renewal. This renewal was tested when in 3114, the scientists of Nesbitt Landing in Alioth began demonstrating substantial innovations in robotic manufacture and production.
0150	Hender's Ascension	Facece		Series 1	Elite History	Hender Saik Duval took the throne quietly. Ascending at the age of twenty two, he was the youngest to attain the throne. \ The new Emperor was a cautious man and his initial action on the political stage reflected this. The development of the Imperial Courier in 3145, the first Imperially funded ship design (designed without to much regard to cost) to appear in several hundred years prompted a large scale effort of renewal that had started with the establishment of the Facece Military Academy in 3104. Ship trials the previous year had suggested the Courier would exceed expectations and so further finance was ploughed into the area of spaceship design.
0151	Hengist's Ascension	Achenar		Series 1	Elite History	In 3233, Hengist Duval ascended to the throne. His coronation, broadcast throughout the Empire, gave the impression of a serene transition. However, behind the veneer lay tensions. The Imperial Senate had gained considerable power in the last years of Hesketh's reign. The first decade of Hengist's rule was tense as the new Emperor struggled to assert himself and repopulate his court with individuals he considered personally loyal.
0152	Innitu's Assassination	Beta Hydri	4,336 ls	Series 1	Elite History	"In 3251, the publication of ""The Thargoids: Truth and Fiction"" by Dr Joreb Innitu of the Alien Studies Department of the Ghandi Institute based on Wicca's World (Alioth) inflamed tension between the Alliance and other political powers. He was ambushed and assassinated whilst leaving the Beta Hydri system after a scientific conference."
0153	Civil War	Tiliala		Series 1	Elite History	In 3251, civil war broke out in Tiliala. The Dictator and leader of the Valhallan Democratic Peace Party, Augustus Checkin, under threat from the Valhallan Liberation Front. 'Friends' of the ruling party put out a contract on the leader of the Valhallan Liberation Army (the armed wing of the VLF), Dentara Rast. \ Over the next few months, the conflict gradually petered out, moving towards a diplomatic solution until other members of the VLA were assassinated. In response, Dentara Rast took to the holo-vid channels and swore revenge. \ The chance discovery of Tantalum (a rare and valuable metal) on the planet drew Imperial interest to the situation. A covert force of Imperial ships were detected by local police, who appealed for Federal assistance and a battlegroup was despatched.
0154	Dentara Rast's Assassination	Tiliala		Series 1	Elite History	Later in 3251, the assassination of Dentara Rast, began a chain of de-stabilising events that would lead, in 3262, to an interstellar proxy war in the system. Imperial agents were blamed for Rast's death as were INRA and the Federation. The cancellation of the elections and lack of a clear perpetrator turned the once peaceful and wealthy Tiliala on its head. Both the Federation and Empire saw the valuable metal as something they could not pass up, Publically the Federation claimed it was 'supporting the stable government', whilst the Empire claimed to be 'assisting in the liberation of an oppresssed populace'.
0155	Chancellor Blaine	Facece		Series 1	Elite History	In 3283, Anders Blaine, Senator of Facece was secretly invited to Achenar. It was clear, Hengist Duval's interest in politics had waned. Blaine was made Chancellor by Imperial decree.

Talks with Governor Malachai were to no avail and war was declared. Despite facing devastating odds, the Durius system fought back valiantly. Senator Patreus  was ultimately victorious, despite facing a desperate opposition, and subsequently brought Durius into the fold as an Imperial system.
0158	Volungu Blight	Furbaide		Series 1	Elite History	Reports began in February 3301 that despite the valiant efforts of medical staff in Liaedin, LHS 3505 and Furbaide the illness known as the Volungu Blight was spreading unchecked. Hundreds died in just 24 hours from the disease. A rapid-response medical team was sent to Effinger Port in the Furbaide system in an attempt to contain the spread. \ Aisling Duval arrived at Effinger Port to offer her assistance along with dozens of trained medical staff. Despite this intervention, the death toll reached thousands within a few days. \ By the end of the month the blight was contained after the pathogen was identified by Aisling Duval's team. By the time the cure was distributed, 3,505 people had lost their lives.

0160	Imperial Palace	Achenar	20,660 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Tourists, once they have amassed the documents required to visit the Achenar system, flock to see the Emperor's palace on Capitol. The building is a vast structure of a pink glass-like material which shimmers in the sun and glows as it re-emits the energy at night. Foreign visitors are welcomed by palace staff who use subtle pro-Empire propaganda in an attempt tp undermine the Federation. This greeting is not extended outside the palace grounds, where a person with a Federation accent is met with scorn unless money can be made out of them. The accent of the Empire has evolved out of Achenarians trying to mock the standard Federation diction by accentuating certain vowels. To the foreigner their speech sounds rather like a whine.
0161	Federal Congress	Sol	749 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Federal Congress is made up of 500 Congressmen (the term for both men and women). They sit in Congress, which is in Olympus Village on Mars - which replaced its location in Washington DC early in the previous millenium. \ Congressmen are elected for an eight year term, along with a President, with a 'vote of no confidence' after four years. If the vote if no confidence succeeds then a full election takes place. A Congressman (or President) cannot serve multiple consecutive terms. \ Every Federation system has representation in Congress, but generally a Congressman represents multiple systems, except a few (like Sol) that have more than one Congressional representative, based loosely on historic population. Phenomenal growth in the outer systems has meant that they have have little representation in the Congress, and there is frequent discussion about creating many new Congressmen to address this balance, but the various power blocks realise it will change the balance of power away from the core systems, the very people who would have to vote it through - so many agree it is unlikely to happen in the near future.
0162	Federal Constitution	Sol	749 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Federal law is based on an agreed Constitution. People have rights and freedoms, enshrined by this agreement. A great many things are illegal, like slavery, cloning and certain narcotics. Local 'State' law prohibits other trafficking to a greater or lesser degree. Things like ship-based weapons, personal weapons, other milder drugs and alcohol are banned in some systems. \ Federal law is controlled by the Mars goevernment, and the sheer size of the Federation makes it very hard for a System to have any influence on changing it.
0163	Church of kum-Byar	Arexack		Series 1	Elite History	The Church of Kum-Byar is a zealot faith in the Arexack system. A civil war between two sects of the church raged for more than one hundred years before an uneasy truce was called in 2361. The religious values of the church are austerity and the removal of all body hair.
0164	Revised Catholic Mission	Aymiay		Series 1	Elite History	Based in Aymiay at a Unniversity, with two further institutions on Mars and Beta Hydri, the Revised Catholic Mission grew out of one of a select few older religions and has tried to update its tenets to reflect the changing nature of interstellar society. The old religious values of pre-space-travel Earth could not cope with the scientific progress of the 3rd and 4th millennium. The 'revised mission', to bring an understanding of moral living, repentance and the need to earn a place in heaven became a more inclusive set of values that could be promoted throughout human interstellar society.
0165	Ancient History	Sol	497 ls	Series 1	Elite History	"Mankind's first ventures into space were tentative and gradual. The early part of the 21st century saw the first manned spaceflights beyond the moon, but it took major population and economic problems to stimulate enough commercial commeitment to start settlements beyond Earth. \ The Third World War saw this exploration expenditure dragged back again and it wasn't until the very end of the 21st century that colonies on Mars and the Moon became truly permanent and viable. \ After the war, the dominant power was the United States of the Americas, and as the remaining other countries joined it over the next few decades, it was renamed the Federation of the United States and later ""The Federation"" as the implied reference to one of the pre-war powers was a block to the remaining countries joining it. It had a constitution and laws derived from the earlier powers, but much simplified."
0166	Early Hyperspace	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The 22nd century saw early pioneering projects begin to take shape. The discovery of a workable hyperspace theory and the design of the first unreliable, inefficient and slow 'faster than light' drive (compared to those we are used to in 3300) opened the possibility of exploration and settlement. A new frontier of science and engineering opened, confirmed by the first detailed messages and system scans t o be received back to Earth from an interstellar probe sent to the Tau Ceti system years earlier. This led to a corporate race-for-the-stars as massive colony projects were founded, funded, built and launched, together with hundreds of automated probes sent to all the nearby systems.
0167	First Interstellar Colony	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Tau Ceti was the first colony established outside of Sol. Tau Ceti 3 (now called Taylor Colony) had long been determined viable for habitation with life already present (due to free oxygen detected in the atmosphere absorption spectra) - though observation and probe data confirmed this. By 2159, the settlement was largely self-sufficient and able to elect a civilian administrator.
0168	Early Colonies	Delta Pavonis		Series 1	Elite History	Other colonies followed soon after. Delta Pavonis, Beta Hydri and Altair were all explored and settled between 2190 and 2230, and an uncontrolled expansion followed, with corporations and all sorts of groups of private individuals heading off into the stars. There was a 'wild west gold rush' atmosphere to it all, as news of vast tracts of land, huge wealth, giant dinosaur-like beast, and heroic acts filtered back to Earth, with the romance of the process causing many to want to leave the mother planet.
0169	Ecological Loss	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The issue of what to do about alien life became a queston of real significance the day humans first set foot on Tau Ceti 3. The early colony found itself battling to survive and adapt in a challending environment. The priority of preserving the indigneuous life was secondary to preserving the lives of the colonists themselves, and indigenous life was suffering due to being out-competed by imported but feral Earth life forms (bot intentionally (pets, crops) and accidentally (disease etc.) imported). This hardy 'survival' attitude did not abate as things grew easier and the colonist, led by John Taylor, saw the environment as something to master. When automated agricultural systems came online, hunting, which had been a necessity, became a trade. Taylor was elected civilian administrator in 2161 and immediately pushed for the colony to become fully independent from Earth. In repsonse and at the behest of the mission's corporate backers, Earth sent a delegation to Tau Ceti 3 to scrutinise its practices. What they found was widespread active destruction of the planet's native ecosystem. The Authority for Ecological Control issued guideleines for habitat conservation and recommended a second mission be sent in twelve months to judge if any improvements had been made. When this arrived in 2163 and found the situation had grown worse, trade sanctions were recommended and imposed. This further strengthened the hand of Taylor who in 2165 proposed a referendum on independence, which was narrowly defeated in the colonial forum.
0170	Accidental Extinction	Delta Pavonis	689 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2182, fragile indigenous life, still at an early stage of its evolution, was discovered in the Delta Pavonis system and through a bacteriological accident, completely wiped out in the same year. When further alien ecologies were discovered in the Beta Hydri and Altair systems, and with the failure of the project to terraform Mars, it looked like humanity would bring the cosmos to its knees, much as it had managed to do to its own planet.
0171	New Leadership	Sol	497 ls	Series 1	Elite History	However, the 23rd century saw new leadership and initiative. The Earth Environmental Recovery Programme to restore the polluted and radioactive regions of the planet was much more successful.
0172	New Agreements	Altair		Series 1	Elite History	The renewed sense of purpose this strategy brought to the planet extended outwards to the interstellar colonies. Agreements were reached with Beta-Hydri and Altair. In exchange for further self-determination each system agreed to maintain and preserve the natural habitats of indigenous life in their star systems. Shortly after this, Delta Pavonis also joined this agreement to act with restraint should any further life be discovered in the system.
0173	Alien Transgressions	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Further ecological transgression by Tau Ceti colonists was uncovered in 2228 when an undercover documentary found its way back to Earth. In it, Tau Ceti colonists were seen flouting Earth decrees and guidelines on a variety of matters, most notably native ecological preservation and the exploitation of natural resources. Mindful of the failure on Mars and the continual infammatory role played by John Taylor, now well into his eighties. Earth sent a military task force to the system with order to revoke its colonial charter.
0174	Federal Accord	Tau Ceti	394 ls	Series 1	Elite History	"In early 2240, hours before the Earth fleet arrived in Tau Ceti, the main settlement changed its name to Taylor Colony and voted for independence from Earth. Without the starships to give battle, the colonists targeted the Earth fleet dropships as they attempted to land. Neither side could could an advantage and so diplomacy resumed. With some bitterness on both sides, a negotiated settlement was reached and in 2242, the Federal Accord was announced. This was effectively an extension of the consitution of the Federation, which briefly changed its name to the ""Federation of Star Systems"" - but this did not stick, and the term ""Federation"" returned. / The Federal Accord granted independent rights and membership to each system that signed it, provided they met certain development goals. Initially each of the signatories (including Earth) did not meet the goals, as the core principle of the agreement made at Tau Ceti was to eliminate the political games that had been played in the previous century."
0175	Non-Human Relic	Sol	749 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2280, the first nun-human relic was found in space. The object was found buried on Mars; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is still surrounded in secrecy, even in 3300. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human.
0176	Second Terraforming Attempt	Sol	749 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2291, the second attempt to terraform Mars was eventually successful. The techniques employed were crude by later standards and the project had taken nearly a hundred years, but finally, humans could walk on the surface and breathe without the need for oxygen suits or respirators.
0177	Logistical Nightmare	Beta Hydri	244 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In the fall of 2323, the fleet journeyed from its staging area at Beta Hydri towards the Achenar system over a period of several weeks. The systems between Achenar and Beta Hydri were largely unexplored at the time, with only a few embryonic colonies at the beginning of the journey incapable of supplying the Federal fleet other than by scooping fuel. This caused Admiral Morgan considerable logistical difficulties and forced him to move only as fast as the slowest ship, with many turning back. / The fleet eventually arrived in the Achenaar system at the start of 2324. Morgan had anticipated resistance and judging his supplies of fuel, he elected to confront the enemy on one decisive battle on the edge of the system. He didn't have a great deal of choice. Smuggled intelligence allow the defending forces to anticipate the arrival position and the defenders were expecting a fight. What they hadn't predicted was their enemy to use their pack hunting formation against them.
0178	Relocation	Sol	749 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Achenar crisis had far reaching consequences for the Federal Council. Earth's leadership had been unquestioned, but the mother planet was already undergoing a difficult period with the climate and radiatio problems on Earth not improving, and yet Mars appearing ever more verdant and a more confortable place to live, there was a general exodus of the rich and influential. The prospect of war with Achenar required a strong hand. In time, the Federal Congress moved from Washington on Earth, to Olympus Village on Mars, and this helped ease friction with other Federation members - as there was a consultation period where other systems were considered. / Nevertheless, the next sixty years saw several fledgling colonies opt out of their colonial charter obligations once they arrived on their chosen world and accept the rulership of the Duvals. The Emperor played the politics skillfully. The massive natural resources being offered and exported from Achenar countered the benefits of then superior Federal technology, whilst the Duval emphasis on subjugating Alien ecology to the needs of the colonies, made them a popular benefactor for struggling settlements.
0179	Sirius Corporation Founding	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	By 2200 corporations had a stranglehold on a great many aspects of life, and this didn't stop during colonisation, though there was quite a delay before the first wholly corporate system was settled. The colonisation of Sirius by a solely corporate mission in 2339 and its rapid to rise to become the premier supplier of drive fuel to first the Federation and then the Empire led to much corporate profiteering between the two powers. Throughout this period, conflicts of interest were raised by congressmen backedby corporate interests. However, eventually Sirius Corporation delegates were also responsible for initiating negotiations between the two powers.
0180	Congressional Streamlining	Sol	497 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Federal colonies continued to mature into Congressional members and became accepted as Federal States throughout the next two centuries. However, the ratification of each colonial charter and approval of membership made the governing body of the Federation more and more unwieldy. This meant getting decisions made became more and more of a laborious and time consuming process, increasingly relying on Presidential Influence. Eventually in 2594, Congress passend an Act reducing the total number of congressmen dramatically at the subsequent election round, amid much controversy. / In parallel, the President's fixed four year term was extended to a single eight year term, with a Vote of Confidence by the people after four years. This was to adress the problem that increasingly the Presidents were serving two consecutive terms (their limit - a historical limit dating back to pre Federation days), and few credible candidates would stand against them in what increasingly were referred to as the 'mid-term' election.
0181	The Birthright Wars	Sol	222 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Between 2621 and 2735, Federal member systems underwent a period of societal change. The original colonial charters of many settlements granted hereditary land and position to families descended from their original settlers. Many of these birthright claims extended across vast areas of land and encompassed massive resources. The old charters became a hindrance especially to corporations who wanted access to these assets and gradually more and more pressure came to bear on the presidential administration to take action against this 'stifling anachrinism'. / The Birthright Wars were the name given to a series of conflicts that resulted in the forced acquisition or redistribution of hereditary rights (depending on your viewpoint) from colonial pioneers to corporations who had necessary technology to exploit these regions. It was generally blamed on corporate greed at the time, but notably the Federal Navy stood by.
0182	Argent's Departure	Ayethi		Series 1	Elite History	One notable power struggle in the Ayethi system was between the Federal military and the Argent family, resulting in Walter Argent leaving the system with as much of the family wealth as he could, and re-settling his family in Alioth. / The Birthright Wars were often cited as a primary reason for former member systems susequently leaving the Federation, and, much later, the formation of the Independent Alliance.
0183	Birthright Final Act	Anlave	464 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The commercial race in starship innovation together with increased funding from the Birthright Wars allowed the Federation to renew and centralise its military power. In the past, mobilising a fleet had required mustering resources from each member system, but generous corporate charters authorised different corporations to build an maintain centralised fleets. The first of this was commissioned and trained at Anlave in 2702, providing a much needed new purpose for the ruined agricultural system. These could be deployed much more efficiently against the Federation's enemies. / Anlave was the site for the final act in the Birthright Wars. Exiled descendants of displaced original colonists, invaded the system in 2708, and bombarded the Naval Academy at Anderton, obliterating it. A battlefleet of privateers descended on the system, but were beaten back by a spirited and shrewd tactician; Admiral Ghenkis B'nami. It was believed at the time that Imperial finance had sponsored the coup, but no link was ever proven, and this is now seen as scaremongering.
0184	First Thargoid Contact	Lave		Series 1	Elite History	"2849 is the first recorded contact between Human and Targoid ships in the Galactic Cooperative sectors, though it was suspected there had been many eralier encounters, just with no human survivors or witnesses. There was a short holo clip of part of the encounter, where the alien ship briefly passed through the field of view before the human ship managed to successfully jump clear. It required a great deal of magnification and in the blurred image there appeared to be the word ""THARG"" - but though different people could see different things in the combinations of what might be a shadow, surface scarring or a logo. Nevertheless in the absence of another name, it has stuck ever since, extended to 'Thargoid' by most commentators. / Encounters continued with many years. Some were just disappearances where no wreckage was found in the vast tracts of space, and may have had nothing to do with aliens, but more the reliability of jump drives of the period, prone to misjumps."
0185	The Gellan Administration	Ackwada	2,850 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2862, the Presidential election was won by Isaach Gellan, whose administration marked a new turn for the Federation in interstellar politics. Within months, agents of the Gellan administration were sent to the Ackwada system to repay substantial unofficial (and illegal) loans made to the presidential campaign. The main creditor was the Rockforth Corporation, who refused a negotiated settlement, holding out for precisely the deal agreed in the election race. In 2864, Gellan and his advisers appeared to have withdrawn from these negotiations, because, instead of agreeing the terms, the Federal Navy was mobilised to invade the system on an unrelated pretext.
0186	Gellan Scandal	Sol	358 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2866 lost his mid-term Vote of Confidence, and the extent of his corruption and corporate links were brought to light shortly afterwards, bringing down a number of Congressmen too, and exposing a seedy sub-culture of corporate entertainment and abuse of Federal power on a massive scale. No on on the corporate side was ever prosecuted, but a period of scrutiny followed and most corporations wisely back off interference with Federal politics for several years.
0187	Ships Lost in Space	Zelada		Series 1	Elite History	In 2867, disappearances of several traders near Zelada prompted a Federal Navy response under the new President Olaf Smith. The task force soon found itself with more to do when further ships disappeared in Ququve and Aymiay in the same year, totalling thirteen ships in three months. In response, the Federation bolstered forces on Laedla rapidly and militarised the system as a base in response to this alien threat. / It has never been determined that these disappearances could be attributed to the Thargoids and little documentation has emerged about the Federal battlegroup's activities in this sector in this period. Nevertheless, Smith made much of his show of strength 'driving away the alien threat' and was popular as a result, further enhancing naval forces and drawing a line under the Gellan incident and the taint it had delivered to the Presidential office.
0188	The Black Prince	Zelada		Series 1	Elite History	"Many decades later the infamous cinemativ biography of the pirate calling himself ""The Black Prince"" claimed responsibility for all these atatacks, unsing what grew to a highly mobile smal fleet of well-equipped matt black Anacondas acting together, each carrying a smal, nimble one-man fighter. The attacks stopped not because of the Federal fleet, but because the Black Prince and his brothers in piracy retired to the outer systems on the wealth they had acquired. Many doubt his story as most of the facts do not check out - but others claimed he had simply exaggerated what was a basically true but far more seedy story."
0189	Gellan's Humiliation	Ackwada	2,847 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2872, now out of Federal prison and with the numerous enquiries that followed the incidents over, Gellan, still a wealthy man, attempted to resolve the matter with the Rockforth Corporation, this time using a mercenary fleet. However, Lanner had remained on retainer and his forces were modern and well equipped. Using Anaconda transports and Cobra Mark I's, Lanner was able to outmanoeuvre Gellan's battle group, forcing another retreat. This second humiliating defeat cost Gellan dearly.
0190	Peacekeeping Failure	Phekda	5,845 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 2876, after a period of economic instability and civil war between its corporate colonists, the Phekda system had descended into chaos. The Federation under President Jeremy Tann launced an offensive to take contril of it. For a period of twenty years, a military governor was imposed and attempts were made to repatriate the system under a new colonial charter, but when new elections drove Tann from office at the end of his term and rebel insurrections began to take their toll and later in 2897, the entire effort was abadoned.
0191	Maurice Grant's Death	Ross 128		Series 1	Elite History	In 2905, the Federation answered a plea to restore order in Ross 128. Maurice Grant, the would-be leader of the colony there, had been assassinated in 2903. A Federal task force took charge of the colony and the rest of the system, then enforced a new colonial charter on its citizens, re-classifying it as a penal and correction facility.
0192	Grant Keller's Election	Ackwada	2,044 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The election of Grant Keller in 2976 saw a change tp Federal policy. Under Keller's administration, corporate investment and involvement in all aspects of Federation society increased dramatically. Recognising the need to restore the financial reserves to the administration which had been utterly exhausted by the previous military expenditures of the last century. / Keller's tenure came to and end in 2984 and Federal policy returned to previous ways. A Federally-supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial fifth fleet in 2986.
0193	Tyrell Biggs' Election	Sol	750 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The election of Tyrell Biggs from Mars to the office of President in 3008, saw another change in approach. Biggs had been a Congressman for Mars for a long time, and made extensive use of his diplomatic connections throughout his tenure. During his election, he talked a great deal about the use of diplomacy rather than force. / In 3008 during a lull in the fighting in Alioth, Federal diplomats secretly approached the Imperial court with a proposition that Achenar and its subsidiary systems join the Federation as full members. / This had been attempted before, and had been met with Imperial derision. The proposition included clauses and amendments that would have allowed the Imperial system to qualify for membership despite the differences between Federal and Imperial law on several matters. However, the leak of the documents by Federal spies to other Imperial systems caused widespread unrest, which might have been Biggs' intention all along. For the next decade, this cooled Imperial/Federal realtions and caused distrust on both sides.
0194	'Proxmire'	Cemiess		Series 1	Elite History	In 3022, Raul Santorini became Governor of Tau Ceti and through his Corporate connections, controlled the system's congressional seat. Santorini, nicknamed 'Proxmire' due to an obscure historical reference, was one of the very few Federal politicians to achieve significant interstellar status. He achieved substantial popularity during his early tenure as Governor by winning a significant tax rebate for the system from Congress, but also championed deep cuts in the Federal Nacy and throughout government, remaining as governor for an astonishing 76 years up until his assassination in 3098.
0195	O'Brien's War	Cemiess		Series 1	Elite History	"In 3098 Governor Santorini of Tau Ceti, was assassinated. The Federal press pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several quotes form 'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an Imperial target. Unusually, the Emperor chose to make a personal rebuttal of the accusation. Nevertheless, three years later Imperial colonists escorted by Imperial warships, settled on Emerald in the Cemiess system. The Federation responded by sending Admiral O'Brien with a task force, who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over the next thirty years, both sides backed local forces (with occasional direct naval confrontation) to gain control of the planet and the system, though ultimaterly Imperial defenders prevailed with the Empire basing the VI Fleet in the system. O'Brien's efforts were popularised in the fictional holo-vid series ""O'Brien's War""."
0196	The Coming of Kum Byar	Arexack		Series 1	Elite History	In 3126, the Federal media's attention turned to the Arexack system. Zack Blackbeam, the interstellar celebrity, socialite and playboy staged a holoprohected light show in the system, called 'The Coming of Kum Byar'. Tens of millions of Federal citizens watched as the naive monks of the hermit like settlements were taken in by the spectacle and led to believe they would be prevented from 'ascending to the Highest Level of Paradise', owing to the 'displeasing shave' of their leader His Magnificence the Right Holy Ssord Rettu III. The comic farce quickly became serious when Rettu's acolytes assassinated him live on interstellar television and the system descended into a violent, religious, civil war.
0197	Onionhead Banned	Kappa Fornacis		Series 1	Elite History	In late 3300 President Jasmina Halsey declared the rare narcotic 'Onionhead' illegal throughout Federal space. Onionhead is the fruit of on alien plant on Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system. / Geogio Algeria, spokesman for the Farmer's Cooperative in the Kappa Fornacis system, accused the President of victimisation. / Tensions between the Onionhead cultivators and the Federation continued to rise, culminating in the bombing of Panem by the Federal Navy. This action seemed to have little effect as a brand new strain of Onionhead was subsequently discovered in markets, having been cultivated somewhere on Luca in the Tanmark system.
0198	Cerberus Plague	BD-02 4304		Series 1	Elite History	A mystery outbreak began on Newton Dock in BD-02 4304 in June 3301. The disease, which came to be known as the Cerberus Plague, soon spread to the neighbouring Bast, Una, Santjalan, Bastes, Maheou Ti and Ochoeng systems. A breakthrough was made in July when a cure was found. / Officials at Hart Station comissioned a memorial to commemorate more than 100,000 people who lost their lives to the plague.
0199	Professor Palin	Nganji		Series 1	Elite History	Late in 3301 Professor Ishmael Palin began an independent research programme, based at Christian Dock in the Nganji System, to study anomalous extraterrestrial objects discovered earlier in the year. / In December he issued a request for help in establishing a new research base on Maia b1ba in order to safely study the artefacts. The request was positively received by the galactic community and Palin's team was soon ready to start work on their new base of operations. / By January 3302 he had announced a dramatic breakthrough in his research into meta-alloys. He confirmed that technical issues at the Obsidian Orbital were a direct result of interference from the artefacts. They also had the ability to repair themself using resources from other ships and machinery.
0200	Obsidian Orbital Constructed	Maia	638 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Work on a new Ocellus starport began in the Kaushpoos system of the Pleiades Nebula on 28'th October 3301. Within a day, pirates began congregating in Kaushpoos, preying on traders and contractors travelling to and from the system. A request for aid was sent out and the pirates were repelled in short order. Later the starport was named Obsidian Orbital via public vote. / On 19th December it was reported that the new station had been affected ny technical issues plagueing the galaxy, but personnel were determined to keep it running.
0201	Notable Presidents	Sol	16 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The complete list of Presidents is too numerous to mention here, so only those who made a name for themselves in intergalactic affairs are listed. / Sadig Kessler (Federal President in 2599 - 2607) / Isaac Gellan (Federal President in 2862 - 2866 (disgraced - lost VoNC)) / Olaf Smith (Federal President in 2866 - 2874) / Jeremy Tann (Federal President in 2874 - 2882) / Verity Campbell (Federal President in 2956 - 2960 (lost VoNC)) / Ulrich Vale (Federal President in 2968 - 2976) / Grant Keller (Federal President in 2976 - 2984) / Tyrell Biggs (Federal President in 3008 - 3016) / Loric Trander (Federal President in 3184 - 3192) / Eugene Cooper (Federal President in 3260 - 3264 (unpopular - lost VoNC)) / Antonia Madison (Federal President in 3264 - 3272) / Jasmina Halsey (Federal President in 3300 - 3301 (disappeared)) / Zachary Hudson ((Federal President in 3301 - present)
0202	Sirius Colonisation	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	In 2339 a commercial colonial expedition reached the unusual binary Sirius system. The colonisation was the first solely corporate colonial mission and the company rapidly rose to become the premier supplier of drive fuel throughout human space. The on-off war between the two major powers over the following centuries financed the initial expansion of the company into an interstellar giant as it supplied both sides. Initially just fuel, but as it became a large interstellar conglomerate, also providing drive technologies and moving into many more fields. / Before it was a hundred years old, the Sirius corporation and its products were thoroughly integrated into civillian and military production throughout human space. It became a trusted partner even during times of conflict, and the organisation took great care to implement 'Chinese walls' between confidential information of its many customers, and put in place a strict protocol so no single customer would be favoured over another, as it fully appreciated its future business depended on it.
0203	The Sirius Convention	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	The Sirius Corporation operated under its own strict laws, governing workers rights, privileges etc., and also put in place conventions whereby in dealings with customers for large projects it voluntarily operated under a special hybrid of local law and Sirius law - where the strictest provision was deemed to be in place. This became known as 'The Sirius Convention' - and was often applied in treaties between independent systems. / The Sirius Corporation developed a strong reputation for fair dealing too. It would never refer to rival jurisdictions or deal terms in a negotiation with a government, and would keep such negotiations strictly to the scope of the deal - not using any of the many levers less scrupulous organisations would frequently call upon. Such delas were said to be conducted 'under the Sirius Rule' - another term that effectively entered the language, much like the 'Chatham House Rule' a millennium earlier.
0204	The Dog Star	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	Sirius was known as the 'Dog Star' in some ancient cultures, and is the brightest star in Earth's night sky.
0205	New Drive Technology	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	In 3278, the Corporation saw a turnaround in its decline with the introduction of a new, faster drive system. Any similarities to the system in the Antares incident were denied at the time, though acknowledgements decades later revealed it was based on the results of the same research program. In the following years further improvements were made available both by Sirius and by its rivals, each dramatically reducing jump tomes, eventually resulted in very rapid hyperspace travel - journeys that previously took days could now be made in seconds - triggering a further age of expansion. / Not only did this success trigger a new period of galactic expansion, but expansion of the Corporation itself. It has expanded into other fields, with offices throughout human space.
0206	Sirius Subsidiaries	Sirius		Series 1	Elite History	The Sirius Corporation has a great many subsidiaries, but its main business centres around fusion reactors of all sorts - it makes and sells hyperdrive fuels, hyperdrives, power plants large and small, luxury surface transports, waste processing reactors, atmospheric processing units, industrial facilities for smelting, refining, and a wide range of mining equipment. It has cemented its position by using standardised parts for its power plants - whether it is at the heart of an industrial smelter, a luxury highliner or a surface city. / The Sirius Corporation now runs several dozen systems. These have a stricht legal system, their own penal code (based on Federal law), and their own law enforcement. They even have their own navy.
0207	Sirius Industrial	Luyten's Star	299 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Sirius Industrial makes a broad range of bespoke heavy industrial installations for smelting, refining, processing and manufacturing. There are largely automaed and easily assembled on site, using local materials for key elements of the construction where possible. All are centred around large Sirius power reactors - often multiple 100GW units are used in a single plant.
0208	Sirius Atmospherics	Sothis		Series 1	Elite History	The early terraforming tended to use genetically engineered biological processes that would change the atmosphere of a suitable world over many decades to a breathable atmosphere using energy captured from the star via biological processes. This process was both slow, expensive (it was made up of many stages) and only a narrow set of worlds were suitable. The idea of doing direct chemical conversion on a vast scale was there, but not practical because of the vast power requirements.
0209	Sirius Navy	Te Kaha	116 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Sirius Navy is a large organisation, providing vigorous protection for all Sirius Corporation interests. It owns its own cruisers built by Imerpial Gutamaya yards, and built under license in Sirius' own naval yards, branded in the Sirius Corporation's own royal blue livery, but much of their naval force comes from a large number of Cutters built under license and by Imperial Gutamaya, operating as patrol ships, and a great many fighters.
0210	WorldCraft History	Epsilon Eridani		Series 1	Elite History	Previously known as the Cisco Corporation, WorldCraft is based in the Epsilon Eridani system and has been the Federation's favourite tourist resort for more then three hundred years. / For centuries Woldcraft (then Cisco) was a major tourist corporation, running tourist resorts throughout human space. It was a big customer of Free World Ventures 'Worldcraft' atmospheric processing units as it began to create whole tourist resort planets in the early part of the 33rd century. To exclude its competitors from this market, it bought FMV in a hostile takeover in 3260 via a leveraged buyout - doubling the size of the corporation in one step, and renamed the whole corporation to 'WorldCraft' (with a capital 'C' in the middle) based on this operation, as at that point Cisco was associated with a broad range of holidays, including the seedier end of the market - something that had prevented Cisco from sucessfully entering the Imperial market. The 'WorldCraft' brand was highly respected, including in Imperial space, and the change was made in the hope of being more acceptable to the Empire.
0211	Competition from Sirius	Epsilon Eridani		Series 1	Elite History	WorldCraft is a giant Corporation, but still has very high debt levels due to the acquisition, and has been seen to be quite unscrupulous in many of its dealings. This has since damaged the WorldCraft brand somewhat, and is not so warmly embraced by the Empire as a result (though some Imperial worlds still have Worldcraft atmospheric processors built by FMV, but now served by WorldCraft in an uneasy relationship). This made way for the creation of Sirius Atmospherics - that has since taken a big slice of the terraforming business from WorldCraft - which WorldCraft has been powerless to stop as they remain a big customer of Sirius as at the core of their terraforming units is a 100GW Sirius power plant. / WorldCraft operates two major business areas; terraforming and tourism/entertainment, making them a direct competitor to the Rockforth Corporation in one and Sirius in the other.
0212	More WorldCraft History	Epsilon Eridani	483 ls	Series 1	Elite History	WorldCraft also operates behind a great many smaller businesses. It has always been very acquisitive, but has also been known to asset strip those businesses it takes over, often letting them fail without honouring customer contracts. / The corporation does not operate in the Empire at all, as much of its business is seen as being unsavoury by Imperial patricians - both some of its 'holidy products' and also business practices. / WorldCraft operate their own Navy, owning a number of branded Federal Cruisers. It also runs a fleet of passenger ships, large and small on 'package tours' to WorldCraft worlds for holiday packages, which are occasionally escorted by their own naval vessels.
0213	WorldCraft Theme Park	Epsilon Eridani		Series 1	Elite History	Most come here for the WorldCraft Theme Park which was set up with no expense spared and costs s small fotrune to visit. It is well worth it though, because you can live in a world of almost any fantasy you wish (something that has given it a reputation for seediness). If you want a break from the lushness outside, you can elect to stay for a day at the Ancient London Earth World of 1960 (where every effort has been made to make it as authentic as possible, it even has the stench of pollution). / Every fantasy theme has its own complex which is self contained, with actors to help tourists play a part in adventures and feel that it is real. / There are more wholesome themes on offer too.

0214	Rockforth Corporation Founding	Ackwada	490 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Rockforth Corporation was founded on Ackwada by the Rockforth Family in 2673, the family that first settled the world. / The Rockforth Corporation began by running Ackwada earning significant foreign exchange from tourism and 'genuine ground-grown food' which it sold far and wide, making very significant revenues. It has since grown into a powerful interstellar corporation, still specialising in agriculture and tourism, with the corporation running giant corporate farms on habitable worlds across especially Federal human space. It has also become quite acquisitive, buying up many of its client companies.
0215	The Dien W'rit Estate	Ackwada	490 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In the early part of 3241, Dien W'rit, a powerful interstellar entrepeneur, died in unusual circumstances while on holiday in Yorksville, Thompson's Planet (Ackwada). The matter was complicated when it was revealed that he had died leaving behind a recently modified Last WIll and Testament which made Thompson , CEO of the Rockforth Corporation, sole heir to the entire W'rit estate. The W'rit family alleged corruption, though they had no evidence othen than the fact of the change in the will. / Then, in July 3251, there was a terrorist attack, launched from unindentified starships, which attacked one of the headquarter buildings in Yorksville. A Federal Senator, several Imperial barristers, and many Rockforth legal staff were killed, not none of the W'rit family, who had left on a trip to see the local wildlife. / The case was dropped, but the attackers were never found. However, in 3273, several members of the W'rit family were present during an explosion at an agricultural facility on Altair.
0216	Ackwada Discovery	Ackwada	7 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The official discovery of this system and its habitable planet is nowadays sccredited to Augustus Brenquith, although the Rockforth Corporation claim the land deeds and development rights to the system. Thirty nine years after the Corporation declared the system its own; an ancient message capsule (a common way for sending messages at the time) was recovered from outside the orbit of Jupiter in the Sol syste,. / The discovery aroused considerable interest amongst archeologists on Earth at the time while the capsule was in transit to the New Delhi University there was heated debate as to whether the artefact should be opened or not. When the capsule was studied, the seal was seen to be broken, so the matter was resolved. Inside the capsule was a message crystal with the log of the second five years of Augustus Brenquith's solitary search for new worlds, his 'glittering lagacy', included in the list of planetary systems that he had stumbled upon was that of Ackwada.
0217	Wreaken Corporation History	Zearla		Series 1	Elite History	Employing over a quarter of a million full time staff and owning sole mineral rights to some forty nine planets, the Wreaken Corporation can be found throughout most of the frontier and Federation Worlds. / Tobias Wreaken was a coal miner from old Earth. His company adopted a cautious and steady approach to its work and this won them a large number of contracts in the early space industry. Wreaken's descendants saw massive opportunities in the Colonial Charter policy of the Federation and few Colonial missions set off without a Wreaken representative and Wreaken equipment.
0218	Wreaken Business	Zearla		Series 1	Elite History	Wreaken facilities exist on many worlds, but their contracts are primarily with the Federation, Independent and Alliance systems. Mining stations extract natural resources and transport them to vast industrial refineries, or with the larger deposits, refine them on site. The company is aggressive in its acquisitions as it strives to maintain its position in the face of direct competition from Mastopolos Mining Incorporated. / The recent discoveries of Tantalum in several systems, including Tiliala during the last century have led to several new contracts for Wreaken. Massive mining operations have been oragnised in the system during the last decade as jurisdictional wrangling between the Federation and the Empire continues. The Corporation hold contracts with both sides in the system and can mine the ore without prejudice. Who the ore is supplied to afterwards, remains a problem.
0219	Wreaken Defence Force	Zearla		Series 1	Elite History	WCM is a major customer of Sirius Mining, making exclusive use of their equipment, under a long term mutually beneficial deal. / Wreaken operate their own fleet of Federal Cutters and smaller ships to provide protection to their many installations, but in extreme cases can call for backup from the Sirius Navy under its commercial relationship - so it is not unheard of for a Sirius battlefleet to back up a Wreaken defence force. Wreaken pays for this service, but it has decided die to the distributed nature of their installations, it is not cost effective to operate its own cruisers. / Many of the ores WCM mines are refined on site, so sale of refined alloys is a big part of their business.
0220	Mastopolos Family	Enayex	250 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Mastopolos family were originally from Achenaar and several members rose to positions of significant Senatorial power in the syste,. However, in 2951, the major interest of Giya Mastopolos lay in solving an Imperial resource crisis and so he financed an expeditionary flotilla into the Zeaex system, empowering Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne Cambridge of the Federation. / After the death of her husband, Gabriella Mastopolos assumed control of the Corporation and guided it to new prosperity. Duke's frivolous ways were quicly forgotten as the organisation ventured out of the Imperial heartlands and courted new contracts with Alliance affiliated systems, even winning business tenders in Alioth.
0221	Gabriella Mastopolos' Leadership	Enayex	4,706 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Mastopolos has recently lost out to Wreaken Mining and Construction over the Tantalum extraction rights in Tiliala. They have, however, taken over administration of Jenning's Hollow in Enayex, where Imperial prisoners operate Tantalum mines. There were some concerns over the Corporation's ability to manage the unruly prison workforce, but following a direct presentation by Gabriella herself, conditions improved dramatically. / Mastopolos Mining has grown to be a major mining force, particularly in Imperial space, occasionally competing directly with WCM. It has its own force of loyal slaves who are treated very well according to Imperial rules (something that Gabriella Mastopolos, now in her 90s, widely insisted upon, and regularly visits installations to do personal spot checks). Slave leave at the end of their assigned terms with a generous bonus (calculated based on their productivity during their term), over and above their required payout under Imperial law. This means the workforce work hard and diligently - and also increases the number of people signing up for such service.
0222	Mastopolos Mining Interests	Enayex	374,770 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Mastopolos Mining is highly rated to do business with. Despite its name, the corporation has broad interests, mostly in and around Imperial space. It operates a fleet of large transport ships - initially to transport its own raw materials around and to supply its mining installations, but it has extended this to carry other goods too. It now runs three whole systems as corporate states, operating its own law (close to Imperial Law), and policed by its own security service. It also has a large number of outposts dotted around, covered by the same security service. / It operates its own navy based around its security service, using a small number of Imperial cruisers in company cokours, together with a fleet of cutters. These tend to deal with pirate incursions, and escort its transport when outside 'civilised' space, while the security service deals with personal issues 'on the ground'.
0223	Faulcon Delacy's Beginnings	Reorte	377 ls	Series 1	Elite History	One of the most famous names in the history of interstellar exploration. The corporation began life as a much smaller organisation. Faulcon Manspace, a military supply organisation based on Reorte. They first rose to prominencse when they developed a new fighter craft they christined the Viper. / In this new era of the emerging interstellar privateer, Faulcon Manspace devoted its production to Vipers, but worked on a number of other designs too. / Faulcon Manspace merged with deLacy ShipWorks in 3034, one of the many shipyards building Faulcon ships under license. / One of the first new products from the merged company was the troubled Cobra MkII. This was an upgraded version of the now very dated Cobra MkI, but was not especially successful and was soon withdrawn. / Despite this, the new company grew into a corporate behemoth, and went from strength to strength, launching the Cobra MkIII to great acclaim in 3100.
0224	Faulcon Delacy's Prowess	Reorte	31 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 3300, Faulcon deLacy stands as the largest independent ship manufacturer in colonised space. The interstellar powers recognise the quality of the work done by the corporation and often recognise this above any concerns over retaining technological exclusivity. It has both grown organically, and by acquisition, swallowing a great many of its smaller competitors and client yards over the years. / Faulcon deLacy is a major corporation, with shipyards dotted around human space, and many more sales offices. It has a wide range of ships available for sale, and an extremely long heritage from its progenitor companies going back over half a millennium. It has manufactured more than a million ships over that period, and a great many are still in use. It sells into all markets, though is widely known and has the highest sales in the vast number of independent systems.
0225	Faulcon Delacy's Business Relations	Reorte	376 ls	Series 1	Elite History	Faulcon deLacy manufactures many of the smaller components in its own ships, and has a well established relationship with the Sirius Corporation, for its hyperdrives and power plants. It is also a big customer of the WCM Corporation - buying its hull alloys from them as raw material. / It still operates a modular system for the construction, which operates throughout their range of products, and all ships are built to a standardised grid system. It has also innovated too - allowing its competitors to use the same system - which has benefitted Faulcon deLacy greatly, and ironically makes acquisition a straigtfoward process.
0226	Saud Kruger's Formation	Bedaho		Series 1	Elite History	The Saud Kruger Corporation is relatively new on the corporate stage, but built on much earlier foundations. It was a small, specialist yacht manufacturer that had been very successful as a family business in a small niche. Stanislav Kruger took over the family firm from this father in 3270. / A luxury ship manufacturer, and interstellar tourism business, the Asrogator Corporation prided itself on delivering the most stylish of holiday experiences. It claims the legedary explorer Augustus Brenquith as its long dead patron and bought up all image rughts to the man's legacy several hundred years ago. / The Corporation was based in Bedaho, but maintains office facilities in 80% of all colonised systems and through its contractual support programm, helps local tourist attractions develop their portfolio for the discerning interstellar explorer.
0227	Saud Kruger's Growth	Bedaho		Series 1	Elite History	Saud Kruger has gone from strength to strength, and has turned around the flagging Astrogator Corporation. It now makes a range of luxury ships under its own brand name, and still competes in the tourism business under the Astrogator name, and in the star chart area too. / Astrogator cruises always used their own custom-built ships, and they continue to do so under Saud Kruger ownership, though of course now although the holidays still go under the Astrogator brand, the ships carry the Saud Kruger name. / These cruises are seen by many as once-in-a-lifetime experiences for those that would otherwise never get to see space.
0228	Saud Kruger Luxury	Bedaho		Series 1	Elite History	Saud Kruger is a popular luxury brand, making passenger ships and yachts for the wealthy under its main brand name, and selling luxury holidays (using luxuriously equipped Saud Kruger vessels) to the less wealthy. It also has a thriving star chart and exploration business. / Saud Kruger ships are made under license in a great many shipyards, including the Imperial Gutamaya yards. It runs its own shipyards too, with its main yards in Bedaho, but with ither yards mostly in Independent and Imperial space, with many especially valued and super-rich Imperial clients. / Astrogator holidays range from cruises around groups of local systems, to the more extreme, and Astrogator Extreme holidays carry the image of the legendary explorer Augustus Brenquith. The holidays tend to include extreme, and frequently quite dangerous, activities in distant locations, like atmospheric wave-riding, volcano diving and magnetic surfing. Trusted intrepid pilots take these adventurers 'to the edge' for 'life-changing experiences'.
0229	Trouble Banking and Welfare Investments	Andceeth	29 ls	Series 1	Elite History	A relatively new organisation. Trouble Banking and Welfare investments is based in Andceeth. In the early days of the Deferation, Diamond star por was a major centre for commercial transactions between planetary governments. Before the days of the Universal Bulletin Board and guaranteed transfer, the worlds of Andceeth were the banking centre for the Federation. / Since the middle of the 31st century, when the system lost its significance, a group of banking entrepreneurs got together with the custodians of the vaults of Andceeth 2, also known as Trouble and began developing an investment company, using the facilities and security abandoned by the Federation.
0230	TBW Loans	Andceeth	50 ls	Series 1	Elite History	In 3300, TBW Investments provides loans and saving oppurtunities for individuals and businesses. It specialises in clients that prefer their assets to remain 'off the grid'. The rates of return are good and the vaults remain secure. They also specialise in the storage of high value items, in private, individual strongboxes, stored in deep underground vaults. Many suspect much of these contents are illegal, ans simply 'cooling off' - though of course the bank would strongly contest that. / TBW also trade in precious stones, both on behalf of clients, and running private markets around human space, but particularly withtin the Federation. They are well known as the best gemstone traders in human space. / TBW maintain their own security fleet. These are mostly fast, and well-equipped, using Fer de Lance craft mostly as comfortable executive transports, carrying small cargoes very securely with perhaps one or two clients only.
0231	FCI Information	Sol	2,623 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Federal Criminal Investigations agency is the Federation's primary domestic security and law enforcement agency. They are numerically inferior to the state police but are better trained and equipped, and cross internal State boundaries. / They are primarily an investigative unit, although they do maintain significant enforcement units. The provide specialist operational support and police backup (like SWAT teams and undercover units) as well as more traditional support for state police forces. / There is a traditional rivalry between the FCI and the State police, but that doesn't prevent them working effectively together. / Its history goes back over a millennium, evolving out of the various security bureaus on Earth. Some rituals still remain, for example the ceremonies when its members are promoted retain an ancient, martial feel, relating to the FBI and FSB - organisations dating to a pre-Federation era - though in fact they don't really relate to them.
0232	FIA Responsibilities	Sol	2,991 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The Federal Intelligence Agency is a secretive organisation that looks after Federal interests outside the Federation. It runs both espionage and counter-espionage operations, and provides covert support for Federal diplomats abroad, providing intelligence relating to foreign operations in addition to protection. It has also been pro-active on many occassions. It has been implicated in destabilising foreign governments, and helping those wíth which the Federal Government is sympathetic or when their causes are aligned. Its operations have gone as far as providing arms and training directly to rebels, assassinations, rigged elections, all done in a clandestine and deniable way. / The FIA also follows up on major interstellar crimes within the Federation, where the crome crosses outside Federal space. It is a secretive organisation (paralleling the Imperial IISS) specialising in corruption and high level crime, and is considered not very accountable.
0233	Imperial Internal Security Service Duties	Vequess	291 ls	Series 1	Elite History	"The Imperial Internal Security Service (or IISS ""Double I, Double S"") reports directly to the Emperor and unlike other police units has jurisdiction throughout the Empire. / In some respects they act as a coutner balance to the Imerpial Navy and have the authority to investigate any individual, unit or organisation. They oprate in quite a secretive fashion as the nature of their investigations tend to be for corruption or abuse of power. and they are generally feared, as by some they are seen as unaccountable. It has, from time to time, been associated with espionage within the Empire. They act on behalf of the Emperorm and that is their allegiance. They do the Emperor's bidding. On occassion that has been to investigate the IDC."
0234	IDC - Keeping the Empire Safe	Facece		Series 1	Elite History	The Imperial Diplomatic Coprs (or IDC) reports to the Senate. Officially it operates embassies in most foreign sysems, but the IDC has far-reaching powers too and unlike other police units has jurisdiction throughout the Empire. It can support Senators and Ambassadors abroad. / The Ambassadors are the visible members of the IDC; high-ranking Imperial officials usually reporting directly to a specific Senator with an interest in their area, but also reporting directly to the Senate. Each Ambassador has a significant staff and budget to project Imperial influence. This staff is said to include secret agents that operate covertly within foreign powers and corporations, but reporting back ultimaterly to the Ambassadors, then on to the Senate.
0235	What is Interpol?	Kuk		Series 1	Elite History	Interpol provides multi-jurisdictional investigation. particularly across Alliance worlds, but also when an investigation strays beyond. In addition it provides support assets for individual Alliance forces when heavy backup is required. / Internal affairs investigations for Alliance organisations are also conducted by Interpol and upon request for member systems too. / Numerically, Interpol is smaller than most systems police forces, but is well trained, well equipped and well respected, Interpol also acts as a direct intervention force on behalf of the Assembly. / It is named after a long defunct organisation dating back more than a millennium from Earth.
0236	History of Lave	Lave		Series 1	Elite History	One of the oldest colonies of the sector, Colonial Deep Space Cruisers Herschel and Oberon reached the system then designated L-453 in 2412. Lave has been a Dictatorship from before the fall of the Galactic Cooperative. In 3174, Dr. Hans Walden came to power. / Walden established an authoritarian Dictatorship. The previous economic hardship brought about by the fall of the Galactic Cooperative were still remembered. Under Walden there was stability, just not prosperity. / Walden's rule was very long, and rumoured to involve genetic manipulation as he greatly extended his own life, with his eventual death at the hands of an assassin triggering a revolution.
0237	Walden's Dictatorship	Lave		Series 1	Elite History	Walden's dictatorship in post-GalCop decades was a study in the use of propaganda to further the illusion of contentment. The public face of Lave was a progressive culture with an enlightened leadership that was remodelling itself as an independent power in the wake of a corrupt and self-serving organisation that had based itself there. Slowly, though, the populace saw where Walden's policies were leading and began to speak up, only to be quietly dealt with. / The revolution in 3265 finally saw the end of Walden's reign of terror but saw Lave relegated to a backwater world too wrapped up in its own troubles to amount to anything on the galactic stage. Its former importance meant that Lave has becone a key tourist venue, with numerous tributes to the GalCop era in terms of museums and artefacts.
0238	Diso's History	Diso	283 ls	Series 1	Elite History	First explored in 2422 by an exploratory mission from Lave, Diso was found to contain a rich indigenous ecosystem, topped by an dominant species of rotund feline-like creatures with rich, black fur called delines. / Human settlement began around the equatorial regions and within ten years, colonists had discovered the planet's potential for agriculture. Inhabitans quickly settled into the planet's rural way of life, adjusting to a slower pace than the more industrial economies nearby.
0239	Diso Delines	Diso	283 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The indigenous delines were driven from the equatorial regions by human settlement, but are still common in the colder, higher latitudes, where they prey predominantly on various ground-dwelling  scavengers known as 'drats' - a collective name for the various rat-like creatures, hated by humans for their effects on their crops. / In the early days of Diso settlement, the delines were hunted, as they had attacked and killed human children from time to time, and in some areas they were very nearly wiped out. In the following years, the resulting drat plague destroyed crops over vast areas, so humans decided to tolerate the delines, and fence them out of human settlements instead. / Today, deline pelts are highly prized, particularly the rich pure-white pelt of the much rarer polar deline, an almost bear-like animal, but nevertheless closely related to the temperate delines.  Delines are still hunted for sport, but this is controlled, and such hunting has become a profitable tourist activity.
0240	History of Waterloo	Riedquat	147 ls	Series 1	Elite History	The planet Waterloo (simpley called Riedquat until about 3190) started life as a promising colony world when it was first colonised in 2631. Though Riedquat had indigenpous life, its was right on the margins, and the little life that existed there was tough enough to survive the harsh environment. This was the primary reason it took so long for it to be colonised. / When it was settled, the introduction of powerful fertilisers allowed crops to be grown on the hard soil, but wihtin a few decades human-introduced rodents (introduced accidently - reputedly from some pet mice) began to destroy crops en masse, and the rodent problem persists to this day, explaining the local name for Waterloo - 'Rat Hole'.
0241	Chaos in Riedquat	Riedquat	147 ls	Series 1	Elite History	By 2679 the situation on Riedquat was dire - the whole world seemed to be in conflict and the continental governments stood on the brink of toppling. At the end of 2680 that indeed happened. Civil war persisted until there were no vestiges of government left. / Somehow, the world's economy has survived, as trade remained a common, essential goal to the inhabitants of the world. Starports are classes as safe areas, as all Riedquat's population understood that the trade with other worlds was now the colony's only access to the things the world needed to stay alive. If anyone threatens these lifelines then that is one of the rare times the Riedquatiens can be seen to cooperate.
0242	Leesti's History	Leesti		Series 1	Elite History	The first colony fleet arrived in 2413, setting up mining facilities, processing plants and domes to protect the workers. As time passend and the colony expanded, the volume  of useful metals promoted organisations to locate some manufacturing plants on Leesti. By the end of the 2400s Leesti had become a popular  source for the fruits of both the mining and manufacturing industries there. / By the 2700s the wild west feel of Leesti was beginning to recede. Corporations took over the mining interests, and with the corporations came the strict security or corporate rule. Mastopolos Mining bacame the main corporation operating in the system by the 3100s, as it scquired many of the smaller mining interests. / Leesti became a popular waypoint during the 3100s for novice traders to find their space legs. The moderately profitable Leesti-Diso run provided the tripartite conglomerate with more than adequate food and agricultural supplies, whilst the return journey provided Diso's populace with computers and cpmponents.
0243	The Bank of Zaonce	Zaonce		Series 1	Elite History	Early in Zaonce's colonial history, in 2682, a former Federation banking executive named Herschel Derrey moved to the colony and set up a family banking business. He and his extended family spread their usiness around the world in only a decade and by 2693 they had earned a reputation as a level headed and reliable financial establishment. Derrey's daughter Emily brokered a loan on an undiclosed but sizeable sum of credits to an up and coming spacecraft manufacturer named Faulcon Manspace in exchange for stock options. Six years later, when the Viper was unveiled, profit rolled in and the stock options for Faulcon Manspace suddenly became vastly profitable to her family. Buoyed by this financial victory, Derrey took over several other banking concers on the world until his corporation was the sole financial establishment on the planet, although operating under different brands. They adopted the name Bank of Zoance in 2718.
0244	Pilots Federation Origins	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	The Pilots Federation has existed for a very long time. It was founded in 2805 during the great surge of private ownership of small starships enabled by the hugely competitive modular ship designs made available during the previous decades. / It was founded as much as a way of agreeing prices for ship parts en masse (where member benefit from group discounts), but soon becane much more, providing a system where trusted pilots could share route information and protect each other from a new scourge - also enabled ny the proliferation of small starships - of interstellar piracy. Over the years an unofficial tally of pirate kills amongst some members began as 'bragging rights' but soon members started showing their kills on their online IDs, and before long those without such a rating were referred to as 'Harmless' - and by implication not so desirable to provide cover on a route known for pirate attacks. / Gradually, the Pilots Federation grew to encompass a great many pilot-owners and their ships. It also provided an element of respectability as the itinerant nature of their lifestyles had started to bring suspicion amongst planet-siders - where the lack of accountability of space farers brought about by their ability to simply move on to a different system before the law caught up with them gave them a bit of a reputation as cowboys or as thieves in certain places. The Pilots Federation would not tolerate dishonourable behaviour among its members, and so such members would wear the PF's logo with pride - earning them a little respect in their dealings, and an antidote to the cowboy image.
0245	The Elite	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	In 3100 the Pilots Federation began issuing modified version of its 'wings' badge that included the pilot's rating written across it in capitals, and made official the names of these ratings, starting with 'Harmless, then 'Mostly Harmless', all the way to 'Elite'. The most coveted was the 'Elite' badge, and the first of these was awarded to Commander Peter Jameson, who wore it on the rear of his Cobra MkIII for the rest of his life. / Before long this small and highly respected group of pilots with these coveted badges became known as 'The Elite'. They received all sorts of offers - both commercial and personal - (including offer of marriage!). The commercial side became valuable - whether it was transporting royalty or taking unknown items 'no questions asked'. The group was considered utterly trustworty, with the confidentiality assured, and its members took this very seriously.
0246	The Elite Federation of Pilots	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	As their reputation spread, the small group became overwhelmed. There was no way they could satisfy anything like all the demands on them, so the formed 'The Elite Federation of Pilots'. This was a sub-group of the Pilots Federation and it ran its own system to exchange offers between its members. It was quite secretive, and hugely respected, and there was a high demand for their services. Their main problem was how few 'Elite' pilots there were. Many pilots would get rich and retire long before they attained the coveted 'Elite' status; the fundamental problem was that the rating was a kill count. Wise members of the group realised that, in fact, they were no better pilots than some younger pilots with much lower ratings - they had just been doing it for longer - though others outside the group didn't see it like that. They wanted the cachet of employing an 'Elite' pilot. They were also aware that the pirates were getting better. They were better organised than in the early days, and better equipped. / It is rumoured they run secret bases and have their own technologies, but what is known for certain is they are highly respected, and get generous discounts throughout human space. In practice the aura of secrecy proved a great strength. The EFP now has representatives throughout human space and beyond, and it is an organisation to which every pilot aspires to be a member.
0247	Pilots Federation Secrecy	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	The Pilots Federation in many ways is a secretive organisation. This in part reinforces its status of neutrality. It exists to support pilots, not nationalities or political factions. Over the years this has led to its acceptance (albeit grudging in some cases) in practically all human domain. / Despite its ubiquitous presence it has very little direct dealings with the public. Even member pilots tend to interact via the networked rankings and bounties system. The prime exception to this is registration. A pilot has to register in person for their PF license. Registration is performent at offices throughout human habitted space. / The PF represents the nearest thing to law in uncontrolled and ungoverned space. Their existence provides a safely net for human expansion in space beyond the major factions. / The Elite Federation of Pilots (EFP) continues as a select and extremely secretive group within the larger organisation.
0248	Pilots Federation Interests	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	The Pilots Federation as an organisation controls a vast financial empire. This is not public knowledge, although the major intelligence services are aware of the fact. However for the most part these financial resources are used to improve safety for pilots and for funding bounties used to improve safety for pilots and for funding bounties where local authorities do not (or in uncontrolled space), some governments have been known to take advantage of this. / The Pilots Federation also takes a private interest in the independent venture with new colonies, this will typically be masked by front companies. In only one known case has the PF taken control of a world or system - see the Founders' World section below. / As well as providing fund for bounties it also receives transaction fees for completed bounties that are processed through the PF bounty system - and in many cases retains unclaimed bounties where, for whatever reason, the pilot who has earned it doesn't claim it. / By far the most significant contribution to the PF's finances is the near monopoly it has for the embedded ship and station systems.
0249	Pilots Federation's Near Monopoly	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	Historically the Pilots Federation has been a trusted soure of information for pilots. As humanity expanded into space that need for informatiuon continued to grow. / Before 3100 they provided data for many ship and station manufacturers. After 3100 in an understated, but effective campaign of acqusitions and mergers they came the dominant provider of this data as well as the hardware and software solutions serving that data. / From star chart data, ship data and bounty management systems the Pilots Federation expanded their data sources to include markets, newsfeeds and communication systems. / In 3300 the Pilots Federation's GalNet system has a near monopoly on all shipboard and station embedded systems. The systems are fitted as standard on nearly all independent ships and even some militaries. It's a testament to the trusted nature of the PF that his monopoly has occured with the little resistance bar some back room negotiations.
0250	Pilots Federation's Influence	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	Officially, the Pilots Federation is apolitical: as an organisation it does not interfere with the internal workings of systems or factions. However this official stance is a misnomer. The PF wields considerable power through its web of political contacts as well as the application of the bounty system and control of the ship and station embedded systems. / It also uses a lot of soft power by providing pilot safety support throughout human space. / There are also known cliques within the PF (The Dark Wheel is probably the most famous) that have their own agendas. Officially these are discouraged, but in an organisation so large they are tolerated as long as they don't overstep the mark.
0251	Pilots Federation's Secrecy	Shinrarta Dezhra		Series 1	Elite History	Much of what the Pilots Federation does revolves around secrecy; and this has many layers. Within the Pilots Federation, the Elite Federation of Pilots is even more mysterious and secretive, and at the centre of that is the elusive 'Founders World'. / It is the only system directly controlled by the EFP, and even its location is closely guarded. The secrecy is maintained by the EFP using 'misinformation' - there are a great many rumours of its rough location - and they all contradict each other. Only a select few - the members of the EFP - know the truth. / The system is governed by the EFP and it is here that the organisation's headquarters is based. / EFP members are allowed to retire here in relative anonymity.
0500	Octavia Quinton's Derelict Asteroid Base	Suijin		Series 2	Elite History	A ruined base left over from events in 3300. The base was rumoured to be a stronghold of notorious pirate lord Octavia Quinton, who was killed in mid 3300 when she became involved in the Reclamation of the Prism system. Today it is a ruin and visitors are warned no to venture within. Rumours abound that it is heavily booby-trapped.
0501	Children of Raxxla Staging Post	Eafots BP-I D9-35		Series 2	Elite History	In mid-3302 the Children of Raxxla set up an outpost near the Heart and Soul Nebula in order to support investigations into a mysterious area of space known as the 'Formidine Rift'.
0502	Slough Orbital - The Cheese Wheel Bar	Vesper-M4		Series 2	Elite History	Morbid true-crime tourists will enjoy the dark and moody ambiance of this bar and fine-cheese dispensary, the scene of the most grisly murder to happen in the system in living memory.

0711	The Devil's Dancefloor	Eeshorks BA-A G2179		Series 4	Elite History	"The system was first discovered during a joint expedition by three well known scientists in the field of gravitational physics: Grace Gutierrez, Rondall Hudon, and Lennox McFadden, back in July of 3303. / EESHORKS BA-A G2179 has researchers buzzing now that its discoverers have gone public with details of the system. It contains a black hole and four neutron stars, and is considered extra special by researchers studying gravitational waves as four of the five bodies that make up the system are organised into two sets of binaries orbiting each other very closely. They orbit so closely that the AB pair orbit each other in approximately two hours (The Swing Couple), and the CD pair in five hours (The Waltz Couple), with both pairs orbiting each other in an area less than 250Ls across. / The A star of the system is a black hole measuring 10.6 solar masses. Bodies B, C and D are each microsecond pulsars with spins aligned by orbits so tight a ship may find itself in the ejecta cones of both pulsars at the same time! The fifth and last body of the system is another neutron star at a range of 342,000Ls which the members of the discovering expedition refer to as ""The Wallflower""."

0714	Transmission from Elysium	ES Cancri	1,904 ls	Series 4	Elite History	"""BEGIN TRANSMISSION / Log Entry from Elysium Starfire / ""We made is and it is as beautiful here as one might imagine. It is so serene, so peaceful. Yet not everyone made it. / Some time ago, I met a woman named Margaret. She and her husband traveled the stars. They weren't necessarily prolific explorers, rather they would travel to war torn systems where she, as a nurse, would treat the wounded and comfort the dying. On one of their expeditions, her husband died and she was left alone with the ship they once roamed the stars in. It was after this time that I met her. She would leave the station pad so slow, I would often tease her by declaring she was the notorious loiterer Margaret Mason, flaunting the law at every station but never caught. / As I said, she wasn't a famous explorer but for some reason when this chance to go to Elysium came up, she wanted to join. She isn't on any of the official rosters as she came along without signing up. There were more than a few of those. / Being a bit of an engineer, I helped prepare her ship for the journey. I have some influence with Farseer at Deciat, so getting her FSD adjusted for the jump at point decision was fairly easy. We replaced some of the ship construction with lighter materials and removed what wasn't necessary. Her ship, Stellar Pearl, was ready. / The day of the jump came and we all left Maia heading to Hades. I like the old songs, so I had a song called 'I see fire' on the PA while landing. It seemed apropos. It occurs to me that using a place called Hades as a rally point to reach a place called Elysium is ironic. Once everyone arrived, we left the star kissed surface to begin the climb to point decision. There things did not go as smoothly. / It was discovered that some specialized software we had all installed for fuel calculations had a bug, but not until the group had started the jump across un-scoopable stars. In addition, fuel use is not linear for some ship configurations, such as my own. Luckily I discovered this fact and was able to compensate. / During the jumps from point decision to Elysium the common radio channel was filled with chatter, some panicked, some calm. Finally, we made it across the gap. / Most of us did anyway. A headcount had showed a few missing. Among the missing was the Stellar Pearl. The last I saw of her ship was at the second star coming across the gap, where most of the confusion had started. Her ship disappeared from the scope leaving a jump wake but apparently never arrived at the other side. / Over the expedition period, I scanned and cataloged my assigned systems always keeping an eye out for my friend or any of the others who didn't come across. They never appeared. / At the time of this recording, there is no known way to get back from this cluster. I send this out in hopes someone on the other side receives it and knows of our fate and remembers those lost."" / END TRANSMISSION"""
0715	Interplanetary Road Trip	Sol	497 ls	Series 4	Elite History	In the early third millennium, a high-profile business magnate made headlines by launching a car into space. Although the launch was seen as a whimsical gesture, the vehicle itself soon acquired the status of a valuable cultural artefact. / Several hundred years later, a consortium of cultrual institutions lobbied to reclaim the car and place it in a museum. After an extensive period of bureaucratic wrangling, a mission was launched to recover the vehicle. / Unfortunately, when the mission reached its destination the car was nowhere to be seen. Its precise fate has never been determined, but the prevailing theory is that it was stolen by pirates.
