Crimson State freedom fighters sold their lives dearly here to buy their comrades time to mount an effective defence against the marauding Federation invaders. / This historical destination was suggested by Commander orfeboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The revered 'Seega Port'. Both active port and pilgrimage sight of the 'Seega Martyrs', and the site of the great sacrifice for freedom. Thousands here fought and lost their lives in a last ditch attempt to buy time and distract Federation forces from the real threat of the counterattack being mounted by Crimson State commands at Hartsfield Market. Ordered to hold out as long as possible, the defenders dug in deep in the hope of wearing out the attackers' supplies. The defenders here were slaughtered but not before completing their mission - overstretching the Federation's ability to wage war within the system. The Federation committed too many of their ground weapons and ammunition here leaving them exposed later in the conflict. / This historical destination was suggested by Commander orfeboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This results in its rings glowing with light when backlit by the star it orbits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the 21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. In main it functions as a means for establishing common policies and treaties rather than laws. / It also acts as an arbitration body between member states and depending on Assembly votes can enforce sanctions or corrective measures.

In 2398, the first of a new wave of colonial missions was sent to the outermost sectors in the opposite direction to the Empire and Lave. / Alioth was colonised in 2452. Survey data and reports had already indicated the rich resources of the system before settlement, but the resources proved richer than expected. / The first colonial settlement in the system was known as 'Fruitcake', the name given owing to the loamy consistency of the planetary surface and its propensity for small mineral deposits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Some only have one. The Prime Minister is elected by the Members, and it is his or her job to corral them into some sort of consensus; generally a slow process. There is much less tradition than in the other powers, and processes within the Alliance Assembly are still subject to change - generally when arguments break out, as they frequently do. In practice the Alliance is largely run by Civil Servants - salaried officials that look after day to day running of the Alliance, generally not getting involved in the political struggles. / The Alliance Defence Force is run by the six member Council of Admirals, independently from the Council of Members, but reporting to it after the event, to facilitate rapid decision-making. Each of the Admirals is from a key contributing Navy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The attempt was thwarted by Imperial commandoes.

In 2617, the death of Tom Quaterson, a munitions worker who had been convicted of selling food coupons to the poor, was the spark that lit the flame of revolt. Workers on the gas platforms seized control of the facilities and planetside, the general populace stormed the Governor's residence. / Quentin Deviseses wasn't just a revolutionary. He had a long term strategy for the system and as soon as the planet was secure, used every means he could to get the word out that Alioth would become a free trade port. / The resource implication of Alioth's independence was too much for either the Empire or the Federation to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Initially this was to be a joint venture between the Empire and Federation, but when a detailed study into the genetic problems on New California linked the issue with the terraforming of the planet in 2612, the Imperials withdrew from the project. / The matter remained a local issue until, in 2854, responding to pressure from Achenar, Imperial soldiers instigated martial law and attempted to impose a genetic correction programme on the planet. This was precented by a coup against the military garrison by a new Caker sect. Within days, the planet had been secured and an appreal was sent to the Federation for assistance. / A fierce battle ensued; Imperial forces from the orbital refineries began a planetary bombardment, but the arrival of a Federal fleet escalated the conflict. Eventually, the Imperial ships pulled back and Admiral Kracer landed with his marines to cheering crowds in the capital. Kracer retired three years later, settling in New California and later became the colony leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This time, conflict was instigated by corporate rivalry in the system's vast gas mining sector. After the discovery of a murdered official named Riley Dain who was investigating the abuse of permitted quotas, the situation quickly escalated. Trander authorised a force off privateers. In response Hesketh Duval sent in the Imperial XV fleet. / The conflict avoided the settlement of New California, owing to the previous treaty, but the settlers there found themselves all but cut off until a further ceasefire was established in 3198. Neither side achieved anything but line the pockets of the industries who fuelled and powered their fleets. It also served to stir further resentment amongst the settlers. At this time, the Caker insurrection became more organised and received substantial financial support from unknown sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

After graduating with honours from the civilian Pilots school, he moved to New California in Alioth, just before the rebellion started. / In 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying New California attempted to raise their prices again, the citizens revolted, taking over the ships berthed in the space station and riding out to the gas mining station to assault the corporate workers. Federal and Imperial forces arrived within days, but fighters from Alioth and several neighbouring independent systems joined forces to repel them. / Turner's pilot skills saw him amongst the first to fly out to the orbital platforms and he won a great deal of respect from his peers for his efforts. It was here the met Meredith Argent, a scientiest who led one of the Caker cells on the gas platforms and was direct descendant of Walter Argent, a wealthy industrial from Ayethi in the the 27th century.

The system had originally been under Federation jurisdiction after being colonised in 2473 to be used as a military staging area for a further invasion of Alioth. Over time, the military bases became more permanent colonies and settlements. The system achievend full federal membership in 2561, but remained relatively unimportant and in the shadow of Alioth for many centuries. / When Alioth finally achieved independence in 3230, Oltiqu might have been a place where the Federation forces could rally and return. However a coordinated peaceful coup by sympathetic federal officials allowed the system to be united under the banner of the Alliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The bloodless revolution is a complete contrast to its partner and robotic manufacturing rival Alioth, whose industry in this area had been expanded into the system in 3229. / Since this time, robotics manufacturing and output within the Holiacan has increased. Several other prominent political figures in Alliance politics have emerged from this system, most notably Lucinda Kallis, who wields considerable influence amongst the system group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

After this it was only a matter of time before the rest of the system surrendered and the Federation withdrew. \ By 3250, the Olgrea system had become a massive part of the Alliance infrastructure. The Planet New Gotham became the centre of agricultural production for the entire Alliance sector. The system population had grown to approach 100 million inhabitants, one of the fastest system migrations in interstellar history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Marlin Duval was a wealthy woman from Earth, who, disenchanted with their administration and authorities, set off with her own colonising fleet to Achenar 6d because it was so far from Earth. Her leadership ended abruptly when her brother Henson oversaw a flying 'accident' in which she perished. The democratic government changed abruptly to one of strict imperial rule and from then on the family assumed leadership. Female children in the family were prevented with genetic techniques, such was the hatred of Marlin Duval's principles and vision of a world in peace. This restriction was gradually phased out over the years, but the succession of Emperors has remained along the male line until recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This, coupled with the refusal of Achenar to become a member, caused the Federation to send a battle group to take control of the system by force. / The fleet eventually arrived in the Achenar system at the start of 2324. Gathered intelligence meant the Imperial forces ambushed the Federal forces as they jumped into the system. What they hadn't predicted was the enemy to use their pack hunting formation against them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Federation ships tried to establish a beach head in the furthest reaches of the system, but with no breathable atmosphere amongst the far planets, they struggled to maintain for the war effort. / Eventually in 2325 Henson Duval decided Federal forces had been weakened sufficiently to strike. Achenar's own small fleet was mobilised, the Duval family commandeering nearly every vessel in the system to fall upon the weakened Federal forces where they clustered on the edge of the system. This became know as the Great Battle of Liberation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The Rockforth Corporation paid up as promised and signed a contract with Lanner's privateers to guarantee the defence of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A clash with Lanner's forces resulted in a stalemate. Using Anaconda transports and Cobra Mark I's, Lanner was able to outmanoeuvre the larger Federal battle group, forcing another retreat. In 2873, Lanner was summoned back to Achenar, Records indicate he departed from Ackwada, but he was never heard from again. A memorial stone was erected in the Hall of Martyrs in his honour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Whilst Wrekcht was a retired Commander of the Fifth Imperial fleet, his actions under an Imperial letter of marque left no doubts to his affiliation. Working from an Imperial cruiser with a prototype engine mask, Wrekcht's audacious attempt to bombard the planet with asteroids was foiled by Federal defence forces. He was believed to have died in the ensuing battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Durn and Resnar Corporation applied for Imperial assistance to enforce its claim over a large swathe of the system's mining rights. A small force of Imperial cruisers and their support ships arrived in the system and rapidly deployed to enforce these claims. They vastly outnumbered the mustered Federal units, and forced them out of the entire system within a year. But then, withouth warning in 2925, the Imperial battle group disappeared. Federal vessels returned and Hassoni-Kruger appropriated the system's mining rights. Within month all assets of the Durn and Resner Corporation were seized by the Emperor. The reson for the strange events has never been discovered. Federal intelligence sources were later to accuse the Duvals of instigating a cloning programme to breed specialised infantry units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Imperial involvement in the disputes in the Liaedin system, beginning in 2945, were subtle rather then heavy-handed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The 'Yorkville Partriots' rose up and defeated the Federation fleet six weeks after they arrived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Hostilities at Alioth were renewed in 2994, whilst a Federation supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial backed forces in 2996.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

To complete his vision, the Emperor hired thousands of the galaxy's best designers and architects to work on the structure. The result is one of the great manufactured interstellar marvels of our age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Massive migration from independent, Galcop and Federation worlds saw an accompanying increase in prosperity. \ To deal with the rapid rise in population across many worlds, the Empire began terraforming of Cemiess 2 in 3080. This put paid to Federal ambitions in the system. A colonial charter had been established since 3055, but lack of funds had prevented any expansion. The act of approving the Imperial settlement proved to be the last of Gaylen Trasken Duval who dies shortly afterwards, he was 109 years of age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

His arrival triggered noticeably less celebration and the man's dour and bitter countenance was quickly noted as a contrast to the theatrically inclined Gaylen. In 3082 a second mission was sent to Exioce, terraforming the planet Experiment and establishing a permanent presence there, putting an end to Federal ambitions in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Popular Federal press sources pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several quotes from 'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an imperial target. Unusually, the Emperor elected to make a personal rebuttal of the accusation, but three years later, Imperial colonists escorted by Imperial warships, settled on Emeral. The Federation responded by sending Admiral O'Biren with a heavily armed battlegroup, who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over the next thirty years, botn sides would battle to gain control of the planet and the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Facece had always been known for its strong support and commitment to training the Empire's finest, but the dedicated base signalled a new fervour for military renewal. This renewal was tested when in 3114, the scientists of Nesbitt Landing in Alioth began demonstrating substantial innovations in robotic manufacture and production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Ascending at the age of twenty two, he was the youngest to attain the throne. \ The new Emperor was a cautious man and his initial action on the political stage reflected this. The development of the Imperial Courier in 3145, the first Imperially funded ship design (designed without to much regard to cost) to appear in several hundred years prompted a large scale effort of renewal that had started with the establishment of the Facece Military Academy in 3104. Ship trials the previous year had suggested the Courier would exceed expectations and so further finance was ploughed into the area of spaceship design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

His coronation, broadcast throughout the Empire, gave the impression of a serene transition. However, behind the veneer lay tensions. The Imperial Senate had gained considerable power in the last years of Hesketh's reign. The first decade of Hengist's rule was tense as the new Emperor struggled to assert himself and repopulate his court with individuals he considered personally loyal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Dictator and leader of the Valhallan Democratic Peace Party, Augustus Checkin, under threat from the Valhallan Liberation Front. 'Friends' of the ruling party put out a contract on the leader of the Valhallan Liberation Army (the armed wing of the VLF), Dentara Rast. \ Over the next few months, the conflict gradually petered out, moving towards a diplomatic solution until other members of the VLA were assassinated. In response, Dentara Rast took to the holo-vid channels and swore revenge. \ The chance discovery of Tantalum (a rare and valuable metal) on the planet drew Imperial interest to the situation. A covert force of Imperial ships were detected by local police, who appealed for Federal assistance and a battlegroup was despatched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Imperial agents were blamed for Rast's death as were INRA and the Federation. The cancellation of the elections and lack of a clear perpetrator turned the once peaceful and wealthy Tiliala on its head.

Senator Patreus was ultimately victorious, despite facing a desperate opposition, and subsequently brought Durius into the fold as an Imperial system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Hundreds died in just 24 hours from the disease. A rapid-response medical team was sent to Effinger Port in the Furbaide system in an attempt to contain the spread. \ Aisling Duval arrived at Effinger Port to offer her assistance along with dozens of trained medical staff. Despite this intervention, the death toll reached thousands within a few days. \ By the end of the month the blight was contained after the pathogen was identified by Aisling Duval's team. By the time the cure was distributed, 3,505 people had lost their lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The building is a vast structure of a pink glass-like material which shimmers in the sun and glows as it re-emits the energy at night. Foreign visitors are welcomed by palace staff who use subtle pro-Empire propaganda in an attempt tp undermine the Federation. This greeting is not extended outside the palace grounds, where a person with a Federation accent is met with scorn unless money can be made out of them. The accent of the Empire has evolved out of Achenarians trying to mock the standard Federation diction by accentuating certain vowels. To the foreigner their speech sounds rather like a whine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They sit in Congress, which is in Olympus Village on Mars - which replaced its location in Washington DC early in the previous millenium. \ Congressmen are elected for an eight year term, along with a President, with a 'vote of no confidence' after four years. If the vote if no confidence succeeds then a full election takes place. A Congressman (or President) cannot serve multiple consecutive terms. \ Every Federation system has representation in Congress, but generally a Congressman represents multiple systems, except a few (like Sol) that have more than one Congressional representative, based loosely on historic population. Phenomenal growth in the outer systems has meant that they have have little representation in the Congress, and there is frequent discussion about creating many new Congressmen to address this balance, but the various power blocks realise it will change the balance of power away from the core systems, the very people who would have to vote it through - so many agree it is unlikely to happen in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

People have rights and freedoms, enshrined by this agreement. A great many things are illegal, like slavery, cloning and certain narcotics. Local 'State' law prohibits other trafficking to a greater or lesser degree. Things like ship-based weapons, personal weapons, other milder drugs and alcohol are banned in some systems. \ Federal law is controlled by the Mars goevernment, and the sheer size of the Federation makes it very hard for a System to have any influence on changing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The 'revised mission', to bring an understanding of moral living, repentance and the need to earn a place in heaven became a more inclusive set of values that could be promoted throughout human interstellar society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The early part of the 21st century saw the first manned spaceflights beyond the moon, but it took major population and economic problems to stimulate enough commercial commeitment to start settlements beyond Earth. \ The Third World War saw this exploration expenditure dragged back again and it wasn't until the very end of the 21st century that colonies on Mars and the Moon became truly permanent and viable. \ After the war, the dominant power was the United States of the Americas, and as the remaining other countries joined it over the next few decades, it was renamed the Federation of the United States and later "The Federation" as the implied reference to one of the pre-war powers was a block to the remaining countries joining it. It had a constitution and laws derived from the earlier powers, but much simplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The discovery of a workable hyperspace theory and the design of the first unreliable, inefficient and slow 'faster than light' drive (compared to those we are used to in 3300) opened the possibility of exploration and settlement. A new frontier of science and engineering opened, confirmed by the first detailed messages and system scans t o be received back to Earth from an interstellar probe sent to the Tau Ceti system years earlier. This led to a corporate race-for-the-stars as massive colony projects were founded, funded, built and launched, together with hundreds of automated probes sent to all the nearby systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

By 2159, the settlement was largely self-sufficient and able to elect a civilian administrator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Delta Pavonis, Beta Hydri and Altair were all explored and settled between 2190 and 2230, and an uncontrolled expansion followed, with corporations and all sorts of groups of private individuals heading off into the stars. There was a 'wild west gold rush' atmosphere to it all, as news of vast tracts of land, huge wealth, giant dinosaur-like beast, and heroic acts filtered back to Earth, with the romance of the process causing many to want to leave the mother planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The early colony found itself battling to survive and adapt in a challending environment. The priority of preserving the indigneuous life was secondary to preserving the lives of the colonists themselves, and indigenous life was suffering due to being out-competed by imported but feral Earth life forms (bot intentionally (pets, crops) and accidentally (disease etc.) imported). This hardy 'survival' attitude did not abate as things grew easier and the colonist, led by John Taylor, saw the environment as something to master. When automated agricultural systems came online, hunting, which had been a necessity, became a trade. Taylor was elected civilian administrator in 2161 and immediately pushed for the colony to become fully independent from Earth. In repsonse and at the behest of the mission's corporate backers, Earth sent a delegation to Tau Ceti 3 to scrutinise its practices. What they found was widespread active destruction of the planet's native ecosystem. The Authority for Ecological Control issued guideleines for habitat conservation and recommended a second mission be sent in twelve months to judge if any improvements had been made. When this arrived in 2163 and found the situation had grown worse, trade sanctions were recommended and imposed. This further strengthened the hand of Taylor who in 2165 proposed a referendum on independence, which was narrowly defeated in the colonial forum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

When further alien ecologies were discovered in the Beta Hydri and Altair systems, and with the failure of the project to terraform Mars, it looked like humanity would bring the cosmos to its knees, much as it had managed to do to its own planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Shortly after this, Delta Pavonis also joined this agreement to act with restraint should any further life be discovered in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In it, Tau Ceti colonists were seen flouting Earth decrees and guidelines on a variety of matters, most notably native ecological preservation and the exploitation of natural resources. Mindful of the failure on Mars and the continual infammatory role played by John Taylor, now well into his eighties. Earth sent a military task force to the system with order to revoke its colonial charter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Without the starships to give battle, the colonists targeted the Earth fleet dropships as they attempted to land. Neither side could could an advantage and so diplomacy resumed. With some bitterness on both sides, a negotiated settlement was reached and in 2242, the Federal Accord was announced. This was effectively an extension of the consitution of the Federation, which briefly changed its name to the "Federation of Star Systems" - but this did not stick, and the term "Federation" returned. / The Federal Accord granted independent rights and membership to each system that signed it, provided they met certain development goals. Initially each of the signatories (including Earth) did not meet the goals, as the core principle of the agreement made at Tau Ceti was to eliminate the political games that had been played in the previous century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The systems between Achenar and Beta Hydri were largely unexplored at the time, with only a few embryonic colonies at the beginning of the journey incapable of supplying the Federal fleet other than by scooping fuel. This caused Admiral Morgan considerable logistical difficulties and forced him to move only as fast as the slowest ship, with many turning back. / The fleet eventually arrived in the Achenaar system at the start of 2324. Morgan had anticipated resistance and judging his supplies of fuel, he elected to confront the enemy on one decisive battle on the edge of the system. He didn't have a great deal of choice.

Earth's leadership had been unquestioned, but the mother planet was already undergoing a difficult period with the climate and radiatio problems on Earth not improving, and yet Mars appearing ever more verdant and a more confortable place to live, there was a general exodus of the rich and influential. The prospect of war with Achenar required a strong hand. In time, the Federal Congress moved from Washington on Earth, to Olympus Village on Mars, and this helped ease friction with other Federation members - as there was a consultation period where other systems were considered. / Nevertheless, the next sixty years saw several fledgling colonies opt out of their colonial charter obligations once they arrived on their chosen world and accept the rulership of the Duvals. The Emperor played the politics skillfully. The massive natural resources being offered and exported from Achenar countered the benefits of then superior Federal technology, whilst the Duval emphasis on subjugating Alien ecology to the needs of the colonies, made them a popular benefactor for struggling settlements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The colonisation of Sirius by a solely corporate mission in 2339 and its rapid to rise to become the premier supplier of drive fuel to first the Federation and then the Empire led to much corporate profiteering between the two powers. Throughout this period, conflicts of interest were raised by congressmen backedby corporate interests. However, eventually Sirius Corporation delegates were also responsible for initiating negotiations between the two powers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, the ratification of each colonial charter and approval of membership made the governing body of the Federation more and more unwieldy. This meant getting decisions made became more and more of a laborious and time consuming process, increasingly relying on Presidential Influence. Eventually in 2594, Congress passend an Act reducing the total number of congressmen dramatically at the subsequent election round, amid much controversy. / In parallel, the President's fixed four year term was extended to a single eight year term, with a Vote of Confidence by the people after four years. This was to adress the problem that increasingly the Presidents were serving two consecutive terms (their limit - a historical limit dating back to pre Federation days), and few credible candidates would stand against them in what increasingly were referred to as the 'mid-term' election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The original colonial charters of many settlements granted hereditary land and position to families descended from their original settlers. Many of these birthright claims extended across vast areas of land and encompassed massive resources. The old charters became a hindrance especially to corporations who wanted access to these assets and gradually more and more pressure came to bear on the presidential administration to take action against this 'stifling anachrinism'. / The Birthright Wars were the name given to a series of conflicts that resulted in the forced acquisition or redistribution of hereditary rights (depending on your viewpoint) from colonial pioneers to corporations who had necessary technology to exploit these regions. It was generally blamed on corporate greed at the time, but notably the Federal Navy stood by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In the past, mobilising a fleet had required mustering resources from each member system, but generous corporate charters authorised different corporations to build an maintain centralised fleets. The first of this was commissioned and trained at Anlave in 2702, providing a much needed new purpose for the ruined agricultural system. These could be deployed much more efficiently against the Federation's enemies. / Anlave was the site for the final act in the Birthright Wars. Exiled descendants of displaced original colonists, invaded the system in 2708, and bombarded the Naval Academy at Anderton, obliterating it. A battlefleet of privateers descended on the system, but were beaten back by a spirited and shrewd tactician; Admiral Ghenkis B'nami. It was believed at the time that Imperial finance had sponsored the coup, but no link was ever proven, and this is now seen as scaremongering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

There was a short holo clip of part of the encounter, where the alien ship briefly passed through the field of view before the human ship managed to successfully jump clear. It required a great deal of magnification and in the blurred image there appeared to be the word "THARG" - but though different people could see different things in the combinations of what might be a shadow, surface scarring or a logo. Nevertheless in the absence of another name, it has stuck ever since, extended to 'Thargoid' by most commentators. / Encounters continued with many years. Some were just disappearances where no wreckage was found in the vast tracts of space, and may have had nothing to do with aliens, but more the reliability of jump drives of the period, prone to misjumps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Within months, agents of the Gellan administration were sent to the Ackwada system to repay substantial unofficial (and illegal) loans made to the presidential campaign. The main creditor was the Rockforth Corporation, who refused a negotiated settlement, holding out for precisely the deal agreed in the election race. In 2864, Gellan and his advisers appeared to have withdrawn from these negotiations, because, instead of agreeing the terms, the Federal Navy was mobilised to invade the system on an unrelated pretext.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

No on on the corporate side was ever prosecuted, but a period of scrutiny followed and most corporations wisely back off interference with Federal politics for several years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The task force soon found itself with more to do when further ships disappeared in Ququve and Aymiay in the same year, totalling thirteen ships in three months. In response, the Federation bolstered forces on Laedla rapidly and militarised the system as a base in response to this alien threat. / It has never been determined that these disappearances could be attributed to the Thargoids and little documentation has emerged about the Federal battlegroup's activities in this sector in this period. Nevertheless, Smith made much of his show of strength 'driving away the alien threat' and was popular as a result, further enhancing naval forces and drawing a line under the Gellan incident and the taint it had delivered to the Presidential office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The attacks stopped not because of the Federal fleet, but because the Black Prince and his brothers in piracy retired to the outer systems on the wealth they had acquired. Many doubt his story as most of the facts do not check out - but others claimed he had simply exaggerated what was a basically true but far more seedy story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

However, Lanner had remained on retainer and his forces were modern and well equipped. Using Anaconda transports and Cobra Mark I's, Lanner was able to outmanoeuvre Gellan's battle group, forcing another retreat. This second humiliating defeat cost Gellan dearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Federation under President Jeremy Tann launced an offensive to take contril of it. For a period of twenty years, a military governor was imposed and attempts were made to repatriate the system under a new colonial charter, but when new elections drove Tann from office at the end of his term and rebel insurrections began to take their toll and later in 2897, the entire effort was abadoned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Maurice Grant, the would-be leader of the colony there, had been assassinated in 2903. A Federal task force took charge of the colony and the rest of the system, then enforced a new colonial charter on its citizens, re-classifying it as a penal and correction facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Under Keller's administration, corporate investment and involvement in all aspects of Federation society increased dramatically. Recognising the need to restore the financial reserves to the administration which had been utterly exhausted by the previous military expenditures of the last century. / Keller's tenure came to and end in 2984 and Federal policy returned to previous ways. A Federally-supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial fifth fleet in 2986.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Biggs had been a Congressman for Mars for a long time, and made extensive use of his diplomatic connections throughout his tenure. During his election, he talked a great deal about the use of diplomacy rather than force. / In 3008 during a lull in the fighting in Alioth, Federal diplomats secretly approached the Imperial court with a proposition that Achenar and its subsidiary systems join the Federation as full members. / This had been attempted before, and had been met with Imperial derision. The proposition included clauses and amendments that would have allowed the Imperial system to qualify for membership despite the differences between Federal and Imperial law on several matters. However, the leak of the documents by Federal spies to other Imperial systems caused widespread unrest, which might have been Biggs' intention all along. For the next decade, this cooled Imperial/Federal realtions and caused distrust on both sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Santorini, nicknamed 'Proxmire' due to an obscure historical reference, was one of the very few Federal politicians to achieve significant interstellar status. He achieved substantial popularity during his early tenure as Governor by winning a significant tax rebate for the system from Congress, but also championed deep cuts in the Federal Nacy and throughout government, remaining as governor for an astonishing 76 years up until his assassination in 3098.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Federal press pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several quotes form 'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an Imperial target. Unusually, the Emperor chose to make a personal rebuttal of the accusation. Nevertheless, three years later Imperial colonists escorted by Imperial warships, settled on Emerald in the Cemiess system. The Federation responded by sending Admiral O'Brien with a task force, who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over the next thirty years, both sides backed local forces (with occasional direct naval confrontation) to gain control of the planet and the system, though ultimaterly Imperial defenders prevailed with the Empire basing the VI Fleet in the system. O'Brien's efforts were popularised in the fictional holo-vid series "O'Brien's War".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Zack Blackbeam, the interstellar celebrity, socialite and playboy staged a holoprohected light show in the system, called 'The Coming of Kum Byar'. Tens of millions of Federal citizens watched as the naive monks of the hermit like settlements were taken in by the spectacle and led to believe they would be prevented from 'ascending to the Highest Level of Paradise', owing to the 'displeasing shave' of their leader His Magnificence the Right Holy Ssord Rettu III. The comic farce quickly became serious when Rettu's acolytes assassinated him live on interstellar television and the system descended into a violent, religious, civil war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Onionhead is the fruit of on alien plant on Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system. / Geogio Algeria, spokesman for the Farmer's Cooperative in the Kappa Fornacis system, accused the President of victimisation. / Tensions between the Onionhead cultivators and the Federation continued to rise, culminating in the bombing of Panem by the Federal Navy. This action seemed to have little effect as a brand new strain of Onionhead was subsequently discovered in markets, having been cultivated somewhere on Luca in the Tanmark system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

A breakthrough was made in July when a cure was found. / Officials at Hart Station comissioned a memorial to commemorate more than 100,000 people who lost their lives to the plague.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The request was positively received by the galactic community and Palin's team was soon ready to start work on their new base of operations. / By January 3302 he had announced a dramatic breakthrough in his research into meta-alloys. He confirmed that technical issues at the Obsidian Orbital were a direct result of interference from the artefacts. They also had the ability to repair themself using resources from other ships and machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Within a day, pirates began congregating in Kaushpoos, preying on traders and contractors travelling to and from the system. A request for aid was sent out and the pirates were repelled in short order. Later the starport was named Obsidian Orbital via public vote. / On 19th December it was reported that the new station had been affected ny technical issues plagueing the galaxy, but personnel were determined to keep it running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The colonisation was the first solely corporate colonial mission and the company rapidly rose to become the premier supplier of drive fuel throughout human space. The on-off war between the two major powers over the following centuries financed the initial expansion of the company into an interstellar giant as it supplied both sides. Initially just fuel, but as it became a large interstellar conglomerate, also providing drive technologies and moving into many more fields. / Before it was a hundred years old, the Sirius corporation and its products were thoroughly integrated into civillian and military production throughout human space. It became a trusted partner even during times of conflict, and the organisation took great care to implement 'Chinese walls' between confidential information of its many customers, and put in place a strict protocol so no single customer would be favoured over another, as it fully appreciated its future business depended on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This became known as 'The Sirius Convention' - and was often applied in treaties between independent systems. / The Sirius Corporation developed a strong reputation for fair dealing too. It would never refer to rival jurisdictions or deal terms in a negotiation with a government, and would keep such negotiations strictly to the scope of the deal - not using any of the many levers less scrupulous organisations would frequently call upon. Such delas were said to be conducted 'under the Sirius Rule' - another term that effectively entered the language, much like the 'Chatham House Rule' a millennium earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Any similarities to the system in the Antares incident were denied at the time, though acknowledgements decades later revealed it was based on the results of the same research program. In the following years further improvements were made available both by Sirius and by its rivals, each dramatically reducing jump tomes, eventually resulted in very rapid hyperspace travel - journeys that previously took days could now be made in seconds - triggering a further age of expansion. / Not only did this success trigger a new period of galactic expansion, but expansion of the Corporation itself.

They even have their own navy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

There are largely automaed and easily assembled on site, using local materials for key elements of the construction where possible. All are centred around large Sirius power reactors - often multiple 100GW units are used in a single plant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This process was both slow, expensive (it was made up of many stages) and only a narrow set of worlds were suitable. The idea of doing direct chemical conversion on a vast scale was there, but not practical because of the vast power requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It owns its own cruisers built by Imerpial Gutamaya yards, and built under license in Sirius' own naval yards, branded in the Sirius Corporation's own royal blue livery, but much of their naval force comes from a large number of Cutters built under license and by Imperial Gutamaya, operating as patrol ships, and a great many fighters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It was a big customer of Free World Ventures 'Worldcraft' atmospheric processing units as it began to create whole tourist resort planets in the early part of the 33rd century. To exclude its competitors from this market, it bought FMV in a hostile takeover in 3260 via a leveraged buyout - doubling the size of the corporation in one step, and renamed the whole corporation to 'WorldCraft' (with a capital 'C' in the middle) based on this operation, as at that point Cisco was associated with a broad range of holidays, including the seedier end of the market - something that had prevented Cisco from sucessfully entering the Imperial market. The 'WorldCraft' brand was highly respected, including in Imperial space, and the change was made in the hope of being more acceptable to the Empire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This has since damaged the WorldCraft brand somewhat, and is not so warmly embraced by the Empire as a result (though some Imperial worlds still have Worldcraft atmospheric processors built by FMV, but now served by WorldCraft in an uneasy relationship). This made way for the creation of Sirius Atmospherics - that has since taken a big slice of the terraforming business from WorldCraft - which WorldCraft has been powerless to stop as they remain a big customer of Sirius as at the core of their terraforming units is a 100GW Sirius power plant. / WorldCraft operates two major business areas; terraforming and tourism/entertainment, making them a direct competitor to the Rockforth Corporation in one and Sirius in the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It has always been very acquisitive, but has also been known to asset strip those businesses it takes over, often letting them fail without honouring customer contracts. / The corporation does not operate in the Empire at all, as much of its business is seen as being unsavoury by Imperial patricians - both some of its 'holidy products' and also business practices. / WorldCraft operate their own Navy, owning a number of branded Federal Cruisers. It also runs a fleet of passenger ships, large and small on 'package tours' to WorldCraft worlds for holiday packages, which are occasionally escorted by their own naval vessels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It is well worth it though, because you can live in a world of almost any fantasy you wish (something that has given it a reputation for seediness). If you want a break from the lushness outside, you can elect to stay for a day at the Ancient London Earth World of 1960 (where every effort has been made to make it as authentic as possible, it even has the stench of pollution). / Every fantasy theme has its own complex which is self contained, with actors to help tourists play a part in adventures and feel that it is real. / There are more wholesome themes on offer too.

It has since grown into a powerful interstellar corporation, still specialising in agriculture and tourism, with the corporation running giant corporate farms on habitable worlds across especially Federal human space. It has also become quite acquisitive, buying up many of its client companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The matter was complicated when it was revealed that he had died leaving behind a recently modified Last WIll and Testament which made Thompson , CEO of the Rockforth Corporation, sole heir to the entire W'rit estate. The W'rit family alleged corruption, though they had no evidence othen than the fact of the change in the will. / Then, in July 3251, there was a terrorist attack, launched from unindentified starships, which attacked one of the headquarter buildings in Yorksville. A Federal Senator, several Imperial barristers, and many Rockforth legal staff were killed, not none of the W'rit family, who had left on a trip to see the local wildlife. / The case was dropped, but the attackers were never found. However, in 3273, several members of the W'rit family were present during an explosion at an agricultural facility on Altair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Thirty nine years after the Corporation declared the system its own; an ancient message capsule (a common way for sending messages at the time) was recovered from outside the orbit of Jupiter in the Sol syste,. / The discovery aroused considerable interest amongst archeologists on Earth at the time while the capsule was in transit to the New Delhi University there was heated debate as to whether the artefact should be opened or not. When the capsule was studied, the seal was seen to be broken, so the matter was resolved. Inside the capsule was a message crystal with the log of the second five years of Augustus Brenquith's solitary search for new worlds, his 'glittering lagacy', included in the list of planetary systems that he had stumbled upon was that of Ackwada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Wreaken's descendants saw massive opportunities in the Colonial Charter policy of the Federation and few Colonial missions set off without a Wreaken representative and Wreaken equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Mining stations extract natural resources and transport them to vast industrial refineries, or with the larger deposits, refine them on site. The company is aggressive in its acquisitions as it strives to maintain its position in the face of direct competition from Mastopolos Mining Incorporated. / The recent discoveries of Tantalum in several systems, including Tiliala during the last century have led to several new contracts for Wreaken. Massive mining operations have been oragnised in the system during the last decade as jurisdictional wrangling between the Federation and the Empire continues. The Corporation hold contracts with both sides in the system and can mine the ore without prejudice. Who the ore is supplied to afterwards, remains a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Wreaken pays for this service, but it has decided die to the distributed nature of their installations, it is not cost effective to operate its own cruisers. / Many of the ores WCM mines are refined on site, so sale of refined alloys is a big part of their business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

However, in 2951, the major interest of Giya Mastopolos lay in solving an Imperial resource crisis and so he financed an expeditionary flotilla into the Zeaex system, empowering Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne Cambridge of the Federation. / After the death of her husband, Gabriella Mastopolos assumed control of the Corporation and guided it to new prosperity. Duke's frivolous ways were quicly forgotten as the organisation ventured out of the Imperial heartlands and courted new contracts with Alliance affiliated systems, even winning business tenders in Alioth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

They have, however, taken over administration of Jenning's Hollow in Enayex, where Imperial prisoners operate Tantalum mines. There were some concerns over the Corporation's ability to manage the unruly prison workforce, but following a direct presentation by Gabriella herself, conditions improved dramatically. / Mastopolos Mining has grown to be a major mining force, particularly in Imperial space, occasionally competing directly with WCM. It has its own force of loyal slaves who are treated very well according to Imperial rules (something that Gabriella Mastopolos, now in her 90s, widely insisted upon, and regularly visits installations to do personal spot checks). Slave leave at the end of their assigned terms with a generous bonus (calculated based on their productivity during their term), over and above their required payout under Imperial law. This means the workforce work hard and diligently - and also increases the number of people signing up for such service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Despite its name, the corporation has broad interests, mostly in and around Imperial space. It operates a fleet of large transport ships - initially to transport its own raw materials around and to supply its mining installations, but it has extended this to carry other goods too. It now runs three whole systems as corporate states, operating its own law (close to Imperial Law), and policed by its own security service. It also has a large number of outposts dotted around, covered by the same security service. / It operates its own navy based around its security service, using a small number of Imperial cruisers in company cokours, together with a fleet of cutters. These tend to deal with pirate incursions, and escort its transport when outside 'civilised' space, while the security service deals with personal issues 'on the ground'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The corporation began life as a much smaller organisation. Faulcon Manspace, a military supply organisation based on Reorte. They first rose to prominencse when they developed a new fighter craft they christined the Viper. / In this new era of the emerging interstellar privateer, Faulcon Manspace devoted its production to Vipers, but worked on a number of other designs too. / Faulcon Manspace merged with deLacy ShipWorks in 3034, one of the many shipyards building Faulcon ships under license. / One of the first new products from the merged company was the troubled Cobra MkII. This was an upgraded version of the now very dated Cobra MkI, but was not especially successful and was soon withdrawn. / Despite this, the new company grew into a corporate behemoth, and went from strength to strength, launching the Cobra MkIII to great acclaim in 3100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It has both grown organically, and by acquisition, swallowing a great many of its smaller competitors and client yards over the years. / Faulcon deLacy is a major corporation, with shipyards dotted around human space, and many more sales offices. It has a wide range of ships available for sale, and an extremely long heritage from its progenitor companies going back over half a millennium.

Before the days of the Universal Bulletin Board and guaranteed transfer, the worlds of Andceeth were the banking centre for the Federation. / Since the middle of the 31st century, when the system lost its significance, a group of banking entrepreneurs got together with the custodians of the vaults of Andceeth 2, also known as Trouble and began developing an investment company, using the facilities and security abandoned by the Federation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It specialises in clients that prefer their assets to remain 'off the grid'. The rates of return are good and the vaults remain secure. They also specialise in the storage of high value items, in private, individual strongboxes, stored in deep underground vaults. Many suspect much of these contents are illegal, ans simply 'cooling off' - though of course the bank would strongly contest that. / TBW also trade in precious stones, both on behalf of clients, and running private markets around human space, but particularly withtin the Federation. They are well known as the best gemstone traders in human space. / TBW maintain their own security fleet. These are mostly fast, and well-equipped, using Fer de Lance craft mostly as comfortable executive transports, carrying small cargoes very securely with perhaps one or two clients only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It runs both espionage and counter-espionage operations, and provides covert support for Federal diplomats abroad, providing intelligence relating to foreign operations in addition to protection. It has also been pro-active on many occassions. It has been implicated in destabilising foreign governments, and helping those wíth which the Federal Government is sympathetic or when their causes are aligned. Its operations have gone as far as providing arms and training directly to rebels, assassinations, rigged elections, all done in a clandestine and deniable way. / The FIA also follows up on major interstellar crimes within the Federation, where the crome crosses outside Federal space. It is a secretive organisation (paralleling the Imperial IISS) specialising in corruption and high level crime, and is considered not very accountable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They oprate in quite a secretive fashion as the nature of their investigations tend to be for corruption or abuse of power. and they are generally feared, as by some they are seen as unaccountable. It has, from time to time, been associated with espionage within the Empire. They act on behalf of the Emperorm and that is their allegiance. They do the Emperor's bidding.

In addition it provides support assets for individual Alliance forces when heavy backup is required. / Internal affairs investigations for Alliance organisations are also conducted by Interpol and upon request for member systems too. / Numerically, Interpol is smaller than most systems police forces, but is well trained, well equipped and well respected, Interpol also acts as a direct intervention force on behalf of the Assembly. / It is named after a long defunct organisation dating back more than a millennium from Earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Lave has been a Dictatorship from before the fall of the Galactic Cooperative. In 3174, Dr. Hans Walden came to power. / Walden established an authoritarian Dictatorship. The previous economic hardship brought about by the fall of the Galactic Cooperative were still remembered. Under Walden there was stability, just not prosperity. / Walden's rule was very long, and rumoured to involve genetic manipulation as he greatly extended his own life, with his eventual death at the hands of an assassin triggering a revolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The public face of Lave was a progressive culture with an enlightened leadership that was remodelling itself as an independent power in the wake of a corrupt and self-serving organisation that had based itself there. Slowly, though, the populace saw where Walden's policies were leading and began to speak up, only to be quietly dealt with. / The revolution in 3265 finally saw the end of Walden's reign of terror but saw Lave relegated to a backwater world too wrapped up in its own troubles to amount to anything on the galactic stage. Its former importance meant that Lave has becone a key tourist venue, with numerous tributes to the GalCop era in terms of museums and artefacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Inhabitans quickly settled into the planet's rural way of life, adjusting to a slower pace than the more industrial economies nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In the following years, the resulting drat plague destroyed crops over vast areas, so humans decided to tolerate the delines, and fence them out of human settlements instead. / Today, deline pelts are highly prized, particularly the rich pure-white pelt of the much rarer polar deline, an almost bear-like animal, but nevertheless closely related to the temperate delines. Delines are still hunted for sport, but this is controlled, and such hunting has become a profitable tourist activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Though Riedquat had indigenpous life, its was right on the margins, and the little life that existed there was tough enough to survive the harsh environment. This was the primary reason it took so long for it to be colonised. / When it was settled, the introduction of powerful fertilisers allowed crops to be grown on the hard soil, but wihtin a few decades human-introduced rodents (introduced accidently - reputedly from some pet mice) began to destroy crops en masse, and the rodent problem persists to this day, explaining the local name for Waterloo - 'Rat Hole'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

At the end of 2680 that indeed happened. Civil war persisted until there were no vestiges of government left. / Somehow, the world's economy has survived, as trade remained a common, essential goal to the inhabitants of the world. Starports are classes as safe areas, as all Riedquat's population understood that the trade with other worlds was now the colony's only access to the things the world needed to stay alive. If anyone threatens these lifelines then that is one of the rare times the Riedquatiens can be seen to cooperate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

As time passend and the colony expanded, the volume of useful metals promoted organisations to locate some manufacturing plants on Leesti. By the end of the 2400s Leesti had become a popular source for the fruits of both the mining and manufacturing industries there. / By the 2700s the wild west feel of Leesti was beginning to recede. Corporations took over the mining interests, and with the corporations came the strict security or corporate rule. Mastopolos Mining bacame the main corporation operating in the system by the 3100s, as it scquired many of the smaller mining interests. / Leesti became a popular waypoint during the 3100s for novice traders to find their space legs. The moderately profitable Leesti-Diso run provided the tripartite conglomerate with more than adequate food and agricultural supplies, whilst the return journey provided Diso's populace with computers and cpmponents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

He and his extended family spread their usiness around the world in only a decade and by 2693 they had earned a reputation as a level headed and reliable financial establishment. Derrey's daughter Emily brokered a loan on an undiclosed but sizeable sum of credits to an up and coming spacecraft manufacturer named Faulcon Manspace in exchange for stock options. Six years later, when the Viper was unveiled, profit rolled in and the stock options for Faulcon Manspace suddenly became vastly profitable to her family. Buoyed by this financial victory, Derrey took over several other banking concers on the world until his corporation was the sole financial establishment on the planet, although operating under different brands. They adopted the name Bank of Zoance in 2718.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It was founded in 2805 during the great surge of private ownership of small starships enabled by the hugely competitive modular ship designs made available during the previous decades. / It was founded as much as a way of agreeing prices for ship parts en masse (where member benefit from group discounts), but soon becane much more, providing a system where trusted pilots could share route information and protect each other from a new scourge - also enabled ny the proliferation of small starships - of interstellar piracy. Over the years an unofficial tally of pirate kills amongst some members began as 'bragging rights' but soon members started showing their kills on their online IDs, and before long those without such a rating were referred to as 'Harmless' - and by implication not so desirable to provide cover on a route known for pirate attacks. / Gradually, the Pilots Federation grew to encompass a great many pilot-owners and their ships. It also provided an element of respectability as the itinerant nature of their lifestyles had started to bring suspicion amongst planet-siders - where the lack of accountability of space farers brought about by their ability to simply move on to a different system before the law caught up with them gave them a bit of a reputation as cowboys or as thieves in certain places. The Pilots Federation would not tolerate dishonourable behaviour among its members, and so such members would wear the PF's logo with pride - earning them a little respect in their dealings, and an antidote to the cowboy image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The most coveted was the 'Elite' badge, and the first of these was awarded to Commander Peter Jameson, who wore it on the rear of his Cobra MkIII for the rest of his life. / Before long this small and highly respected group of pilots with these coveted badges became known as 'The Elite'. They received all sorts of offers - both commercial and personal - (including offer of marriage!). The commercial side became valuable - whether it was transporting royalty or taking unknown items 'no questions asked'. The group was considered utterly trustworty, with the confidentiality assured, and its members took this very seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

There was no way they could satisfy anything like all the demands on them, so the formed 'The Elite Federation of Pilots'. This was a sub-group of the Pilots Federation and it ran its own system to exchange offers between its members. It was quite secretive, and hugely respected, and there was a high demand for their services. Their main problem was how few 'Elite' pilots there were. Many pilots would get rich and retire long before they attained the coveted 'Elite' status; the fundamental problem was that the rating was a kill count. Wise members of the group realised that, in fact, they were no better pilots than some younger pilots with much lower ratings - they had just been doing it for longer - though others outside the group didn't see it like that. They wanted the cachet of employing an 'Elite' pilot. They were also aware that the pirates were getting better. They were better organised than in the early days, and better equipped. / It is rumoured they run secret bases and have their own technologies, but what is known for certain is they are highly respected, and get generous discounts throughout human space. In practice the aura of secrecy proved a great strength. The EFP now has representatives throughout human space and beyond, and it is an organisation to which every pilot aspires to be a member.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This in part reinforces its status of neutrality. It exists to support pilots, not nationalities or political factions. Over the years this has led to its acceptance (albeit grudging in some cases) in practically all human domain. / Despite its ubiquitous presence it has very little direct dealings with the public. Even member pilots tend to interact via the networked rankings and bounties system. The prime exception to this is registration. A pilot has to register in person for their PF license. Registration is performent at offices throughout human habitted space. / The PF represents the nearest thing to law in uncontrolled and ungoverned space. Their existence provides a safely net for human expansion in space beyond the major factions. / The Elite Federation of Pilots (EFP) continues as a select and extremely secretive group within the larger organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This is not public knowledge, although the major intelligence services are aware of the fact. However for the most part these financial resources are used to improve safety for pilots and for funding bounties used to improve safety for pilots and for funding bounties where local authorities do not (or in uncontrolled space), some governments have been known to take advantage of this. / The Pilots Federation also takes a private interest in the independent venture with new colonies, this will typically be masked by front companies. In only one known case has the PF taken control of a world or system - see the Founders' World section below. / As well as providing fund for bounties it also receives transaction fees for completed bounties that are processed through the PF bounty system - and in many cases retains unclaimed bounties where, for whatever reason, the pilot who has earned it doesn't claim it. / By far the most significant contribution to the PF's finances is the near monopoly it has for the embedded ship and station systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

As humanity expanded into space that need for informatiuon continued to grow. / Before 3100 they provided data for many ship and station manufacturers. After 3100 in an understated, but effective campaign of acqusitions and mergers they came the dominant provider of this data as well as the hardware and software solutions serving that data. / From star chart data, ship data and bounty management systems the Pilots Federation expanded their data sources to include markets, newsfeeds and communication systems. / In 3300 the Pilots Federation's GalNet system has a near monopoly on all shipboard and station embedded systems. The systems are fitted as standard on nearly all independent ships and even some militaries. It's a testament to the trusted nature of the PF that his monopoly has occured with the little resistance bar some back room negotiations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

However this official stance is a misnomer. The PF wields considerable power through its web of political contacts as well as the application of the bounty system and control of the ship and station embedded systems. / It also uses a lot of soft power by providing pilot safety support throughout human space. / There are also known cliques within the PF (The Dark Wheel is probably the most famous) that have their own agendas. Officially these are discouraged, but in an organisation so large they are tolerated as long as they don't overstep the mark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Within the Pilots Federation, the Elite Federation of Pilots is even more mysterious and secretive, and at the centre of that is the elusive 'Founders World'. / It is the only system directly controlled by the EFP, and even its location is closely guarded. The secrecy is maintained by the EFP using 'misinformation' - there are a great many rumours of its rough location - and they all contradict each other. Only a select few - the members of the EFP - know the truth. / The system is governed by the EFP and it is here that the organisation's headquarters is based. / EFP members are allowed to retire here in relative anonymity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Its a black hole, white dwarf, and neutron star system which contains the three main know endphases of star evolution, so likely a very old system that has been through quite a lot. It is just 2 million years under being 13 billion years old according to the system data, so nearly the age of the universe itself - with two terraformable terrestrial waterworlds with carbon-water based life, one with a moon. / What kind of life could live and evolve there and sustained itself in that kind of environment for so long? Perhaps some form of life more advanced than we can comprehend dwells within the watery depths of these worlds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It's on the periphery of the sun's exclusion zone, yet can be landed. Due to the massive size of the star a limit of .33 ls will be encountered for the majority of the travel and this will lead to a build up of heat. Most craft will not be able to land but for the tourist who seeks danger, and the unique sight of having a star fill the entire horizon, it may be worth the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A miner was discovered dead on the surface, but the autopsy was unable to reveal why. The data recordings on her SRV revealed a burst of radiation, but without any reference to its source. The case remains unsolved to this day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Rumours abound that it is heavily booby-trapped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The owner was found dead, his head sawed in two by one of his own cheese slicers. No proof of who, or what, committed the crime was ever discovered. The murderer remains at large. / The murder was first reported in the Slough Observer by rookie reporter, Jack Nova.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The conflict was precipitated by the exiled Senator of Prism, Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, partly in response to the Chione 'Reclamation', a rebellion, which took place on the moon below. The Prism system was restored to Imperial jurisdiction as a direct result of the battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It has been earmarked for future investigation by the group's xenobiologists, and if settled could one day act as a way-point base facilitating transit to and from the Colonia Nebula. Rohini in Hindu mythology is one of the children of the goddess Kamadhenu (the Empire system of Kamadhenu is home to the Chapterhouse of Inquisition). / This location was suggested by Commander Edgar Starwalker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The group hopes that this world and system could one day play host to a stepping stone base towards Colonia, as well as a staging ground for wider Imperial exploration efforts of this region of the Sctutum-Crux Arm. Gandharvi is another of the children of Kamadhenu in Hindu mythology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

When this spectacle was discovered by the Chapterhouse Mission to Jaques and news broke back on Kamadhenu, a local sect of sadhus interpreted this as fulfilment of a prophecy. They saw the ringed ELW as "Kashyapa" - the legendary consort of Mother Kamadhenu, a fabled paradise - and are now fixated on one day establishing a religious retreat in this system.

In the weeks following Emperor Hengist's passing in mid 3301 the backroom politics of the Empire turned vitriolic. In particular the reace for the throne caused conflicts to erupt between followers of Arissa Lavigny-Duval and those of Aisling Duval.

Prove your driving skills by descending down the steep, rought and dark slope into the valley. Once there, reward yourself by going full throttle and enjoy the geology this planet seems to have created just for you. Move up the gentle slope on the other side, take a few breaks here and there, and let the view sink into your soul. / After recalling your ship and returning to the base, our spa services will be more than happy to prep your ship before you leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

That was until intrepid scouts visited the seas of the system's water world, Aapelinja 2, where they discovered that the planet was home to some of the galaxy's most astounding aquatic megafauna. Subsequently this system has developed a thriving aquatic safari industry to satisfy the demands of tourists desperate for a chance to see these magnificent beasts in their natural, unaltered habitat before the effects of terraforming kick in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If so, Exphiay's Discovery planet is for you. Relax by the blue waters, or hike on the snowy mountains. Anything is possible on Discovery. Also, you'll never hear anything about the superpowers there. Over 300ly from Sol, it is an amazing destination."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

That's the "Grey Sector". It is a system with no stars; all the celestial bodies orbit a black hole. There are a few gas giants, all of which are a deep purple colour, and one of which has dark, pitch-black rings surrounding it. The planets are desolate but support surface exploration, and the sensation of being on one can fill peoples' souls with so much bleakness and dread that they'll wonder why such a place even exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Why? The beautiful NGC 7822 Nebula is pierced by a line of O-stars - therefore it has been compared to Cupid's arrow piercing a heart. Approaching this nebula is an experience in its own, with each jump the bright band of O-stars becomes clearer and clearer as well as the Nebula unfolds its colourful beauty. Once arrived, this area is filled with black holes and vibrant stars.

WREGOE TV-L C24-0 lies over 1,200 light-years due 'north' of Sol's vertical position in the galactic plane, yet less than a light year from Sol's position otherwise. It is these unique coordinates that led its discoverer to call the tiny M-class dwarf 'Sol's True North Star,' as Polaris is located directly north of Sol only when viewed from Earth's northern pole. Visitors to this system are guaranteed a spectacular view of the Milky Way Galaxy, a view only made more poignant by the system's special connection with Humanity's birthplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The Osira system is most notable for hosting the hottest terraformed planet in human space. Osira A 3, which lies far closer to its hot, A-class parent star many observers feel is prudent for human habitation, also has a co-orbiting neighbor which was once slated for terraforming as well. The company responsible for terraforming the third planet allegedly sold investors on the project claiming the planet would purposely be kept dry and arid, using the now-infamous tagline 'It's not the heat, it's the humidity!' Records show the terraforming company went bankrupt shortly after the planet's colonization. Osira A 3's climate has been charitably described by non-residents as an 'acquired taste', and plans to terraform its sister world are said to be on an indefinite hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Professional as well as amateur. The main star of this system is an unusually cool Wolf-Rayet star at 385 Kelvin, giving it the deep magenta hue associated with the coldest of brown dwarves and T Tauri stars. Its blue companion star will illuminate the passengers as they admire this stellar anomaly.

It may be worthwhile mounting scientific expeditions to find out what sort of life-forms could survive in such a heavily irradiated environment as well as the mystery of how life managed to evolve on such a planet in the first place. Furthermore it is way above the galactic plane so the chance of an extrasolar capture is very low, therefore it's likely that the planet became life-bearing after it fell into orbit about the neutron star. Temperature, pressure and atmospheric oxygen are all tolerable for humans but radiation-proof clothing is strongly advised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Deep scanning has revealed extremely rich underground deposits of Germanium, Niobium and Tungsten but, due to enormous volcanic activity and high surface temperature, conventional mining methods are impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Space Cat this, Space Cat that - yeah, yeah. But have they seen it? Have they been caught in its gaze; that colossal Eye staring at you; judging you. I've seen it; and it has seen me. / I was way out; heading for Sagittarius A*, but far off track. I saw a system from afar, blazing in the ultra-violet bands. I locked on and jumped. I came out of the jump, the radiation alarm went nuts! A lethal wash of xrays and gammas was pounding on the shields; but my old Cobra MkIII ?Syntax Error? held together. The scanner sent out its pulse - triple black holes! Three of hte monsters... I could see one straight ahead, bending gravity; but where were the other two? I rolled the Cobra around and there it was! THE EYE OF THE SPACE CAT! I said a prayer to any gods I knew - Buddha, Hendrix, Bastet - I even vowed to serve the Simguru Pranav Antal all my days if I could just get away from that giant alien feline Eye... I must have, because I'm here now. And I know - I KNOW that it's still out there... watching...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Scores of independent pilots responded to the organisation's request, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Obsidian Orbital, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to construct a new Imperial operating base in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system. / The spokesperson released a statement: / "I know there are some who decry the Empire for its part in this conflict.

By contributing to this campaign, you can help me keep that promise."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Using debris retrieved from the ship, capricious talent Delvin Hoorgan has created a striking tribute to the souls lost on the ships inaugural flight. / The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a crescendo of brilliance before subsiding. / Delvin Hoorgan waived his usual commission to participate in the project.

Eventually is looked as if starship enterprises and Blue Creative would merger to compete against some of the bigger and more established neighbouring corporations. However, in a surprise twist of events, negotiations were broken off during one of the final meetings and the CEO of SE Corp, Dr. Lewis Chapman was seen storming from the conference room. Dr. Chapman seen released a statement in a press conference saying that his corporation would split from Blue Creative and strike out as an independent corporate entity. So began Starship Enterprises long Struggle to become the principle company in LP 339-7.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

After the Split between SE and Blue Creative, the IVP put up a lot of political pressure to try and halt the progress of Dr. Chapman's Corporation. They did this because of their opposing views on black market trading in 339. Dr. Chapman had in the past accused the IVP of 'under the table transactions with disreputable parties' and demanded that they close the black markets in their stations. Dr. Chapman however is an accomplished diplomat and spokes person and he did not take the IVPs pressure lying down. The media helped to inflame events all the more and eventually hostilities broke out between SE and IVP, spiralling finally into full blown civil war. These were dark times for LP 339-7 but SE corp threw the full weight of their corporation against the declining IVP party and won the war, taking control of Whitson Orbital in the process. Over the course of the next few months Starship Enterprises turned Whitson Orbital around, making it the principal trading post in the system. Dr. Chapman overhauled two subsidiary companies to incorporate into Whitsons infrastructure: the Terran Wild-life Project which clones species of Earth animals, and Galaxy Tours, Starship Enterprises sightseeing company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It was a long and difficult journey. But during this time SE Corp had instigated several successful ventures that benefited the system. The Galaxy Tours sightseeing company was bringing in droves of new tourists into 339 while SE Corps private security sector was working hard to quell the vital trading lanes. Whitson had begun a humanitarian aid program to help supply local factions experiencing famine. It was ventures like these that eventually won the hearts and minds of the people of 339 and so when Dr. Chapman announced his desire to run in the local elections, it attracted unprecedented media coverage. A clever campaigning team aboard a requisitioned Beluga Liner set forth to get those votes into the SE ballot boxes and after four tiring days, Starship Enterprises took the system, and So-Yeon as their prize. Dr. Chapman quickly moved his agricultural trading framework over to So-Yeon so that it could take over the mantle of main trading post while Whitson orbital focused on science, exploration and tourism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A Blue Creative owned satellite nicknamed blue planet quickly became an important outpost for a number of reasons. A military outpost called Thirsk Survey became an important stop off point for SE security forces in their ongoing war against crime in the outer system. SE gunslinger pilots plied their trade in the local resource extraction sites, protecting entrepreneuring miners. Scott Beacon and its famous race track became the home of the SRV Race Club, entertaining locals with their wild and wacky races.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This company was called the Terran Wild-Life Project. The small team had managed to get their hands on some genetic data, purchased from the Mother Gaia democratic party in Sol. The data was a genetic library of Earth species of animals. The teams idea was to clone the animals for release onto newly terraformed planets across the galaxy. The animals would be gene tailored to suit their new environments and selected so that they would fit in with the new ecosystems. Although the company still retains its original ethos, Dr. Chapman has overhauled them in a much bigger project. Not only do they provide the CEO with his own private supply of horses on his ranch on So-Yeon Planet, but they have also been working on large scale game reserves on Whitson Planet. These sprawling reserves are full of a variety of animals from Earths history, everything from birds of prey to humpback whales. The projects aim is to generate touirsm in Lp 339-7. So far the venture seems to be a raging success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

At 2:35 am on the 7th of May 3303, Commander Tannik Seldon had an unfortunate mistake that would lead the pilot going down in legend. / Tannik Seldon had signed up for a race known to many as the Buckyball. These races held all over the galaxy are known for punishing routes and questionable sanity of the racers. This particular event known as "the Aquarium Job" tasked pilots with racing between three locations using an unmodified Adder, and an SRV to complete the course. It was here at cooper Arena, looking for an edge on his competitors that the commander made what he initially thought was a superb tactical move. Remembering that ships completing the race with 1% hull received a time bonus, Seldon proceeded to lower his vessels hull to the required amount. However this would prove his undoing. Having completed his scan at the nearby settlement Seldon called his ship in for a landing and watched in stunned silence as his ship exploded as it touched down. No amount of duct tape was going to solve this problem. / Many pilots would have given up at that point, called for assistance of looked for the self destruct button. But not Tannik Seldon. / Technically he was still in the race. With a quick check of the race rules and remembering that there was a port on the other side of the planet. What followed goes down as the greatest moment to date in Buckyballing history. It was game on. / With just one week before the end of the race, Seldon accepted the challenge and set off on a mammoth 3000 km journey, which he describes as "Slightly inconvenient by the face that (station) was on the exact opposite side of the planet". / Seldon showed supreme levels of determination, concentration and near god like driving skills as he drove the colossal distance to what he hoped was his way off the planet. His route crossing mountains, canyons, and huge craters all while averaging speeds upward of 80 m/s with the knowledge that one unfortunate bounce or spin could spell disaster. / So it was until 2:50 PM on the 12th of May 3303 when Seldon announced to the many people following his progress two words, "Mission Accomplished". He had made it. Seldon did not want to bask in his achievement instead immediately buying a new regulation Adder and completing the race, making him the first Buckyballer to lose his ship halfway through a race and still finish successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Thoughtful, kind, empathetic and ambitious extending even to making the trip to Beagle Point which he achieved i nthe year 3303... albeit with a few dings and bumps along the way! / He was an avid lover of exploration and photography among many other things, and spent his time traversing the galaxy with friends, putting the world to right wihle finding black holes, neutron stars, unexplored systems and everything else the cosmos could offer him. / He's now found his place among the stars and will be remembered by his family and wingmates for years to come, and we hope that upon finding this beacon you will be inspired to achieve your goals and reach for the stars, just like CMDR Thomaski would have wanted. / o7, Commander.

The bar is called "11 Parsecs" and attracts many tourists from the Core Worlds, as it offers a wide selection of rare alcoholic beverages, otherwise available only in their respective systems of origin. The tourist clientele is rich and sophisticated. Sometimes a few rugged spacers can be seen amongst them - these are the Commanders that helped build the bar. They often return to this place to have a drink or two and chat about the good old times, before the Thargoids came                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It contains a black hole and four neutron stars, and is considered extra special by researchers studying gravitational waves as four of the five bodies that make up the system are organised into two sets of binaries orbiting each other very closely. They orbit so closely that the AB pair orbit each other in approximately two hours (The Swing Couple), and the CD pair in five hours (The Waltz Couple), with both pairs orbiting each other in an area less than 250Ls across. / The A star of the system is a black hole measuring 10.6 solar masses. Bodies B, C and D are each microsecond pulsars with spins aligned by orbits so tight a ship may find itself in the ejecta cones of both pulsars at the same time! The fifth and last body of the system is another neutron star at a range of 342,000Ls which the members of the discovering expedition refer to as "The Wallflower".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It is so serene, so peaceful. Yet not everyone made it. / Some time ago, I met a woman named Margaret. She and her husband traveled the stars. They weren't necessarily prolific explorers, rather they would travel to war torn systems where she, as a nurse, would treat the wounded and comfort the dying. On one of their expeditions, her husband died and she was left alone with the ship they once roamed the stars in. It was after this time that I met her. She would leave the station pad so slow, I would often tease her by declaring she was the notorious loiterer Margaret Mason, flaunting the law at every station but never caught. / As I said, she wasn't a famous explorer but for some reason when this chance to go to Elysium came up, she wanted to join. She isn't on any of the official rosters as she came along without signing up. There were more than a few of those. / Being a bit of an engineer, I helped prepare her ship for the journey. I have some influence with Farseer at Deciat, so getting her FSD adjusted for the jump at point decision was fairly easy. We replaced some of the ship construction with lighter materials and removed what wasn't necessary. Her ship, Stellar Pearl, was ready. / The day of the jump came and we all left Maia heading to Hades. I like the old songs, so I had a song called 'I see fire' on the PA while landing. It seemed apropos. It occurs to me that using a place called Hades as a rally point to reach a place called Elysium is ironic. Once everyone arrived, we left the star kissed surface to begin the climb to point decision. There things did not go as smoothly. / It was discovered that some specialized software we had all installed for fuel calculations had a bug, but not until the group had started the jump across un-scoopable stars. In addition, fuel use is not linear for some ship configurations, such as my own. Luckily I discovered this fact and was able to compensate. / During the jumps from point decision to Elysium the common radio channel was filled with chatter, some panicked, some calm. Finally, we made it across the gap. / Most of us did anyway. A headcount had showed a few missing. Among the missing was the Stellar Pearl. The last I saw of her ship was at the second star coming across the gap, where most of the confusion had started. Her ship disappeared from the scope leaving a jump wake but apparently never arrived at the other side. / Over the expedition period, I scanned and cataloged my assigned systems always keeping an eye out for my friend or any of the others who didn't come across. They never appeared. / At the time of this recording, there is no known way to get back from this cluster. I send this out in hopes someone on the other side receives it and knows of our fate and remembers those lost." / END TRANSMISSION" |

Although the launch was seen as a whimsical gesture, the vehicle itself soon acquired the status of a valuable cultural artefact. / Several hundred years later, a consortium of cultrual institutions lobbied to reclaim the car and place it in a museum. After an extensive period of bureaucratic wrangling, a mission was launched to recover the vehicle. / Unfortunately, when the mission reached its destination the car was nowhere to be seen. Its precise fate has never been determined, but the prevailing theory is that it was stolen by pirates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
