Jupiter Division ships have engaged in battle with rival Federal vessels
in the HIP 54530 system.\
\
Loyalists to former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester have built their
own breakaway faction in HIP 54530. The FIA suspects that Jupiter
Division agents first infiltrated the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group
years ago, and permit locked the system to conceal their efforts to
overtake it from within.\
\
Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group announced:\
\
\"We will not tolerate these criminals illegally controlling this
system. Once victory is won, the Federation will be able to bring
Rochester to justice.\"\
\
The Silver Legal Group has asked Federal auxiliaries to support its
efforts to degrade Jupiter Division\'s military force by handing in
Combat Bonds at the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the HIP 54530
system.\
\
The Pilots Federation has agreed to supply all ships participating in
this conflict with temporary permits to access HIP 54530. These will
expire early on Thursday the 18th of February. However, neither
permanent nor temporary system permits apply to fleet carriers, since
they are capable of ferrying vessels which could evade detection and
authorisation.\
\
If victorious, each tier beyond Tier 1 will provide a 5% reduction to
outfitting at Northrop Enterprise in HIP 54530 to those with access to
the system, lasting for one month starting on Friday the 19th of
February 3307.\
\
The top 75% of contributors will be allocated a permanent system permit
for HIP 54530 by Friday the 19th of February 3307.\
\
Early on Thursday the 18th of February 3307, the Iron Wings of Justice
megaship controlled by the Silver Legal Group will move to the Ts\'ao
Tach system. If victorious, it will be authorised to issue permanent
system permits to those who meet their requirements.\
\
The two factions have set out six-day campaigns, which will end early on
Wednesday the 17th of February 3307.
