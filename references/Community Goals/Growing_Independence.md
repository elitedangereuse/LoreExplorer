Help us build our Megaship!\
\
When the S\'jett family was driven out of its home system by
Federal-Imperial conflict, it established a new an independent faction
in HIP 105408 -- the Kuun-Lan.\
\
Since then, the Kuun-Lan has gone from strength to strength. But while
its new home has become a haven for miners and traders, one thing is
missing: a reliable source of food. The Kuun-Lan has therefore announced
plans to establish an agricultural network in HIP 104292, and is calling
on the galactic community for support.\
\
The organisation has reserved generous reimbursements for pilots who
contribute atmospheric processors, crop harvesters, land enrichment
systems, building fabricators, animal monitors and aquaponic systems to
the initiative.\
A spokesperson for the group released the following statement:\
\
\"We hope the galactic community will heed our call and help us secure
our independence. If we can successfully complete this campaign, we can
improve living standards for millions of people.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of October 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
