Core Dynamics, one of the galaxy\'s largest starship manufacturers, has
announced a new construction initiative in response to the rise in
Thargoid attacks.\
\
A spokesperson for Core Dynamics released the following statement:\
\
\"The number of ships lost to Thargoid attacks is increasing rapidly,
leaving us with no option but to accelerate our production schedule. But
we cannot do this without the support of the galactic community.\"\
\
Guaras Blue Creative Partners have agreed to oversee the initiative,
asking pilots to deliver titanium, power converters and superconductors
to Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system. When the campaign officially ends
on the 28th of December 3303, a discount of up to 20 per cent will be
applied to the Federal Dropship, Federal Gunship and Federal Assault
Ship for one week. Additionally, the rank requirements for those ships
will be temporarily lifted.\
\
The campaign begins on the 21st of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Titanium, Power Converters, and Superconductors to
Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
