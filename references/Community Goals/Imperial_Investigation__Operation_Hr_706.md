The ongoing investigation into the attack on Emperor Hengist uncovered a
trail that led to a bank account, set up under a false identity, by
someone operating out of HR 706. The account wasn\'t set up by some
amateur thug. They left no clue behind as to their true identity.\
\
This could have caused a serious problem for the Princess\'s agents.
However, in conjunction with other evidence, the investigative taskforce
believe that the account\'s activity shows that an organisation directly
serving the would-be killer conspirator(s) may well call this system
their home.\
\
Someone out there has the answers Princess Arissa needs. As such, the
order has been given to forcibly shut down all criminal organisations
operating in this sector. If the local scumbags want it to stop, they
know what they have to do.\
\
Emperor\'s Grace has reluctantly agreed to play host to the taskforce,
who have established a temporary base of operation aboard Laming
Orbital. Citizens involved in the ongoing hunt for justice should submit
their Imperial Bounty Vouchers for processing there.
