The Omega Mining Corporation has requested deliveries of raw materials
for a new Orbis starport, to be built In the heart of the galaxy.\
\
The construction of the starport constitutes part of the ambitious
Distant Worlds II expedition. Project leader Erimus Kamzel told the
media:\
\
\"The Distant Worlds fleet is privileged to be at the forefront of this
ambitious industrial and scientific initiative - humanity\'s first
starport in the Galactic Centre region.\"\
\
Independent miners are invited to deliver shipments of Indite, Gallite,
Praseodymium and Cobalt to Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector
VE-Q b5-15 system.\
\
The initiative begins on the 17th of January 3305 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Indite. Gallite, Praseodymium and Cobalt to Omega
Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 system.\
\

negatively impact markets and station services, and could prevent the
initiative from running smoothly.
