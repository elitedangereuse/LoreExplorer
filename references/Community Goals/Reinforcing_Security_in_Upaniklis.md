A generation ship with a living population has been discovered in the
Upaniklis system.​\
​\
The ship\'s distress signal was initially picked up by a listening post.
Investigating pilots were surprised to find that the ancient vessel -
identified as the Golconda - had drifted into the uninhabited region
around Upaniklis B.​\
​\
Itsuko Harada of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated gave the following
statement:​\
\
\"These visitors have crossed incredible distances, entirely
disconnected from the rest of humanity until now. Sheer desperation has
forced these proud people to call for help -- a disease referred to as
'the wasting kiss\' is running rampant, and in a closed environment its
effects may prove catastrophic.\
\
Understandably, the Golconda\'s people are reluctant to leave their home
or interact with the rest of the galaxy, at least at present. They have
gratefully accepted our offer of medical supplies and other materials,
however.\"\
\
Traders have been asked to deliver various commodities to Fozard Port in
the Upaniklis system to assist the ship. To protect these traders,
Upaniklis Vision Incorporated is offering bounty vouchers on wanted
ships in the system to deter pirate activity in the area.​
