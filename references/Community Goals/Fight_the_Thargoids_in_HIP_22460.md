As the Thargoid presence increases in the HIP 22460 system, Azimuth
Biotech and the superpowers call for reinforcements.\
\
An urgent bulletin was transmitted from Commodore Morag Halloran aboard
the Bright Sentinel:\
\
\"A series of actions by \'Operation Wych Hunt\' saboteurs have resulted
in delays to Azimuth Biotech\'s supply infrastructure. As a result of
these traitorous acts, we have been forced to amend the construction
timetable for the Proteus Wave.\"\
\
\"Salvation informs me that it will be approximately two more weeks
until the weapon is fully assembled. This delay increases the Proteus
Wave\'s exposure to Thargoid intervention, potentially undermining the
project. But we remain convinced that the majority of pilots are
committed to ensuring a human victory.\"\
\
\"After discussions with Admiral Atherton, Admiral Price and Admiral
Ziegler, the coalition has agreed to provide funding for increased
defences in HIP 22460. For the next two weeks, independent pilots can
claim reimbursement for the hazardous task of engaging the Thargoids.\"\
\
\"Thargoid combat bonds can be handed in at the Musashi megaship in the
nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system. The most dedicated Commanders
by contribution will be rewarded with Salvation\'s pre-engineered
Guardian gauss cannons.\"\
\
The top 50% of contributors will receive one small Salvation Gauss
Cannon.\
The top 25% of contributors will receive two small Salvation Gauss
Cannons.\
\
The campaign begins on the 14th July 3308 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
