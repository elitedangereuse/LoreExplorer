Authorities in the Lidpar system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally spreading discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Union of Lidpar Green Party has placed a
kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Lid system, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Carlisle
Station.\
\
The campaign begins on 23rd of March 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in bounty vouchers at Carlisle Station in the Lidpar
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
