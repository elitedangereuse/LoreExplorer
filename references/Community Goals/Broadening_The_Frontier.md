As innovators at the forefront of human colonisation, the Sirius
Corporation has a proud history of seeding life amongst the stars. Now
the time has come for a new wave of interstellar expansion that will see
the corporation launch a fleet of outposts into the cold depths of
space.\
\
The expansion program is fully funded and volunteers are ready to go,
all that remains is to identify a series of capable candidate sites.
Ideal candidates will either have earth-like planets, good terraforming
possibilities or exceptional natural resources.\
\
Commanders interested in participating in the exploration portion of
this project must register as official agents of the Sirius Corporation
aboard Nourse Orbital before submitting any data for analysis.
