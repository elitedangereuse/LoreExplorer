As the antagonism between the Federation and the Empire continues to
simmer, the Federation has announced plans to expand its Navy with three
new Farragut-class Battlecruisers. The development follows a recent
initiative to add three new capital ships to the Imperial fleet.\
\
In a statement, Federal President Zachary Hudson spoke candidly about
the motivation behind the campaign.\
\
"We live in uncertain times, and we are on the brink of an uncertain
future. When I speak to the people of the Federation, I want to be able
to promise them that their homes and families are safe. By contributing
to this campaign, you can help me keep that promise."\
\
The Federation has placed an open order for autofabricators, tantalum
and superconductors for use in the construction, and has authorised the
Workers of Gooheimar Alliance to reward pilots who deliver the requested
materials to Brady Horizons in the Gooheimar system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week.
If the Federation\'s targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering autofabricators, tantalum and superconductors to to
Brady Horizons in the Gooheimar system.\
\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
This is a huge paycheck opportunity commanders, each unlocked tier, the
rewards for this CG are doubled. Lets work hard and get paid as kings.\
