Each year, the Annual Galactic Games Organisation holds an elaborate
gaming tournament known as the Gathering, enticing the rich and famous
to a chosen system for a week-long party.\
\
This year\'s event will take place at the Norman -- Mavis\'s Bingo
Palace starport in the Aramzahd system, chosen for its proximity to the
lush planet of Guardinia. In addition to the games, there will be
historical flight displays and presentations from many of the galaxy\'s
premier ship manufacturers. System authorities have welcomed the event,
which is expected to attract thousands of guests and bring in millions
of credits.\
\
In anticipation of the event, the Aramzahd Empire Party has placed an
open order for Centauri Mega Gin, Giant Irukama Snails, Lavian Brandy,
Tanmark Tranquil Tea and Witchhaul Kobe Beef. Pilots who deliver these
commodities to Norman - Mavis\'s Bingo Palace in the Aramzahd system
will be generously rewarded. The organisation has also placed a kill
order on all wanted ships operating in Aramzahd, to ensure the safety of
those attending the event.\
\
The campaign begins on the 13th October 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
