Despite the repeated assurances of the galactic authorities, which have
endeavoured to downplay the scale of the Thargoid threat, it is clear
that many of those in the core systems feel less than secure. This is
evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to Colonia, eager to
escape the Thargoids.\
\
In response to this development, the Colonia Council issued the
following statement:\
Colonia has always been a haven, and we would never deny entry to those
fleeing danger. But if we are to provide people with homes and
employment, we must build. We have therefore made plans to establish a
number of new outposts throughout Colonia, to support our new
neighbours.\
\
Unfortunately, the urgency of the situation means we cannot rely on our
usual trade partners, and we are therefore turning to the galactic
community for support. We have placed an open order for a range of
construction materials, and have set aside considerable premiums for
pilots who deliver these goods to Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar
system.\
The campaigns begin on the 7th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Evacuation Shelters, Auto Fabricators and Power
Generators to Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
