The Explorer\'s Association has started work on a new Ocellus starport
in the Kaushpoos system, but the miners gathering resources for the
project are being harassed by local agitators. The Explorers\'
Association has issued an appeal for help, promising to reward those who
help eliminate the troublemakers.
