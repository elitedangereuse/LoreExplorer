After sustained Thargoid attacks on civilian targets in the Pleiades
Nebula, system authorities have launched a rescue operation to locate
and recover survivors.\
\
The operation is being coordinated by Superintendent Marla Poulsen of
Aegis Research, who made this announcement:\
\
System authorities in the Pleiades have been channelling their resources
into combating the Thargoid menace. As a result, search-and-rescue
initiatives have been neglected, but we are determined to plug that gap.
That means a lot of civilians rescued from escape pods, which also means
a lot of hungry mouths to feed, so we\'ll need to bolster our current
food stocks as a precautionary measure.\
\
Pilots are requested to recover occupied escape pods and damaged escape
pods. In addition, the following food resources are also required: fruit
and vegetables, grain, and food cartridges. Both recovered pods and food
stocks should be delivered to Donar\'s Oak in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W
D1-55 system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th of August 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Grain, Food Cartridges, and Fruit and Vegetable to
Donar\'s Oak in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
