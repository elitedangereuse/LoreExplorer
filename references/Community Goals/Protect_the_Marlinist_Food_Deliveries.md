The Marlinist Colonies have requested assistance to feed their
population.\
\
Eight systems were colonised by the Sirius Corporation to act as
permanent reservations for the political refugees. Millions of
Marlinists have now relocated to these settlements, thereby reducing
tension between the Empire and the Federation.\
\
The newly formed Marlinist factions are holding democratic elections to
select their leaders. However, the transitional parliament has declared
an emergency due to the shortage of food stocks.\
\
The Free Marlinists of Carinae anticipate that there will be disruptive
attacks from pirates and anti-Marlinism activists, and has offered
bounties on all wanted ships which should be handed in at Stillman Hub
in the HIP 22550 system.\
\
If successful, the Free Marlinists of Carinae in conjunction with other
Marlinist factions will give the top 75% of pilots a fully engineered,
focused and lightweight point defence module.\
The module will be placed in storage at Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550
system by the 23rd of January 3307.
