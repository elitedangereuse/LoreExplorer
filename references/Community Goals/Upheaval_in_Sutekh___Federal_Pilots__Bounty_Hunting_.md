Recent reports indicate that a Federal convoy has been destroyed in the
Sutekh system. It is not yet clear who is responsible for the attack,
but security agencies based in Sutekh have tentatively identified the
Adad Exchange, an Imperial faction.\
\
The Adad Exchange is also understood to have launched an operation to
recover Data Cores from the wreckage. The Federation has responded by
placing a kill order on all Adad Exchange ships operating in Sutekh. The
United Sutekh Future has been authorised to coordinate the campaign, and
has promised to reward pilots who support the operation.\
\
The campaign begins on the 16th of February 3303 and will run for one
week. If the operation achieves its aims earlier than planned, it will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Archimedes Gateway in the Sutekh system. Only
Bounty Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
