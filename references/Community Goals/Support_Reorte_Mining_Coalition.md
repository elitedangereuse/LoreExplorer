Deliveries to Reorte Mining Coalition will determine the system\'s
future status.\
\
The system\'s controlling faction wishes to declare independence, in
protest against Sirius Corporation\'s proposed anti-xeno defence pact
with the Alliance Defence Force.\
\
Reorte Mining Coalition\'s CEO Fergus Cassidy announced:\
\
\"Prime Minister Mahon\'s insistence on working with Sirius leads us to
believe our interests are best served outside of the Alliance. To
prepare for Reorte\'s potential transition to an independent system, we
ask for shipments of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building
fabricators to be delivered to Davies High starport.\"\
\
It is expected that if Reorte Mining Coalition is successful, all
systems currently under its governance would similarly be classified as
independent.\
\
The dual initiatives begin on the 24th of March 3308 and will run for
one week. Should the campaign to support Reorte Mining Coalition reach
the maximum tier it will end immediately.
