Following the return of Onionhead to Panem, Federal systems throughout
the Ceti sector have found themselves suffering from a terrible spike in
crime. As a result, law-abiding traders and contractors are leaving the
Ceti sector in droves.\
\
This situation cannot be allowed to stand.\
\
As the Federal Navy has been ordered to not act against Kappa Fornacis
directly, a coalition of concerned local leaders has decided to take
matters into their own hands. A range of bonuses will be made available
to all pilots who take part in the ongoing Ceti Security Initiative.\
\
Let\'s show those pirates scum how the Federation deals with people who
disrupt the TBL. Any Federal Bounty Hunter wishing to take part in the
security initiative are asked to sign up for active duty aboard
Artyukhin Ring.
