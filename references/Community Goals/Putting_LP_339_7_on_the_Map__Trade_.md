Dr Lewis Chapman, CEO of the Starship Enterprises Corporation, has
announced plans to transform the LP 339-7 system into a popular tourist
destination.\
\
To achieve this, the Starship Enterprises Corporation intends to
establish a wildlife reserve on the planet LP 339-7 4 A. The reserve
will be occupied by various cloned Earth animals, genetically tailored
to suit their environments, created by the Starship Enterprises
Corporation.\
\
In support of this project, the corporation has placed an open order for
progenitor cells, animal monitors, aquaponic systems, atmospheric
processors, land enrichment systems and advanced medicines. Pilots who
deliver these commodities to Whitson Orbital in the LP 339-7 system will
be generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 15th of December 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering the requested commodities to Whitson Orbital in the LP
339-7 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly\
