The bombs used in recent terrorist attacks on four Imperial starports
may have been developed by Liz Ryder, an Engineer in the Eurybia
system.\
\
The Imperial Internal Security Service published this report:\
\
\"Analysis of station traffic revealed that the explosives were
delivered on cargo transports linked to the Eurybia Blue Mafia, a
notorious anarchist organisation that we have reason to believe is
secretly supplying the NMLA.\"\
\
\"The Eurybia Blue Mafia is protecting the demolitions expert Liz Ryder,
who we strongly suspect of designing the specialist weapons used in the
starport bombings. As they have refused to cooperate, a state of war has
been declared until she is surrendered to our custody.\"\
\
\"Our local representative, the Keltim Empire League, has requested the
support of independent pilots against any resisting anarchist forces.\"\
\
If victorious, the Demolition Unlimited workshop will continue providing
services to Commanders with existing access, but future access will be
handled by the Empire.\
\
The two factions have set out week-long campaigns, which will begin on
the 1st of October 3306.
