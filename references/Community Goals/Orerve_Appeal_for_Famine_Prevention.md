Two coordinated trade initiatives have been launched, spearheading
efforts to mitigate the impact of low crop yields in key systems. ​\
​\
The initiatives have been organised by Crimson State Limited in the Diso
system and Orerve Universal Limited in the Orerve system. The
significant loss of crops in these agricultural centres is a primary
cause for the low availability of staple foodstuffs. ​\
​\
The initiatives received praise from Dr. Genevieve Kane of the
Interstellar Association for Agriculture:​\
\
\"This campaign is a step in the right direction, and with the help of
the galactic community should stop the situation from becoming a
full-scale crisis. The IAA is currently investigating the reasons for
such poor harvests, and it seems that a new form of blight may be
responsible for the rapid degeneration of crops. Scientific teams are
analysing samples of diseased tissue, and we expect to know more
soon.\"\

Traders are asked to deliver pesticides, synthetic reagents and grain to
Watson Station in the Orerve system.​
