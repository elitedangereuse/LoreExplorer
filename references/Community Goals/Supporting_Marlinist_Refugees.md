An aid charity is requesting deliveries of vital supplies to help
Marlinist refugees that fled from the Empire to the Federation.\
\
Safeguard Interstellar, a humanitarian aid organisation, has announced a
campaign to help refugees requesting political asylum in the
Federation.\
\
Several Imperial factions sympathetic to Marlinism were placed under
martial law, leading to civilians emigrating in huge numbers to Federal
systems. Local authorities have warned that without additional support,
these refugees may trigger public unrest or food shortages. There is
also a risk of unfamiliar contagions reaching the population.\
\
Noel Beaumont, the CEO of Safeguard Interstellar, made this statement:\
\
\"These ex-citizens of the Empire have suffered at the hands of their
own government, and now seek freedom from persecution. Shelter, food and
other necessities must be provided to satisfy their basic human
rights.\"\
\
\"We urgently require shipments of basic medicines, clothing, food
cartridges, fruit and vegetables, and evacuation shelters to Fox
Enterprise in the LFT 625 system, from where they will be distributed to
the Marlinists. The more supplies we receive, the more systems can offer
sanctuary without strain on their infrastructure.\"\
\
Each target will provide enough aid to support one system in the
following order: LTT 3607, Charunder, Ennead, Thetis, LTT 1935 then HIP
36081.\
\
The initiative begins on the 22nd of October 3306 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
