Brewer Corporation requests deliveries in the Colonia system for the
next phase of the Colonia Bridge project.\
\
A successful initiative in October resulted in the placement of 30
dockable megaships at intervals of several hundred light years,
providing services such as refuelling and repairs. The second phase
seeks to establish this support for the full route between the core
systems and the Colonia region.\
\
A press release from Brewer Corporation stated:\
\
\"We are now ready to continue work on the Colonia Bridge, by
constructing additional megaships to fill the middle of the planned
route. As before, we require shipments of ceramic composites, computer
components and thermal cooling units at Jaques Station in the Colonia
system.\"\
\
\"Should deliveries reach sufficient levels, the top 75% of contributors
will be awarded an engineered frame shift drive with increased range and
faster boot sequence. Our hope is that this encourages deep space
explorers and long-distance haulers to take part in the Colonia Bridge
project.\"\
\
As an additional reward, the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia
will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new megaships.
Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of
directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet
submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to add the following
megaships to the Colonia Bridge route by the 25th of November 3307. The
module reward class is also decided by the final tier.\
\
Tier 1: 2 dockable megaships\
Tier 2: 1 additional dockable megaships\
Tier 3: 1 additional dockable megaships / Modified 3A Frame Shift Drive\
Tier 4: 1 additional dockable megaships / Modified 4A Frame Shift Drive\
Tier 5: 1 additional dockable megaships / Modified 6A Frame Shift Drive\
\
Rewards tiers are cumulative, and higher tiers will include rewards from
lower tiers.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of November 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
