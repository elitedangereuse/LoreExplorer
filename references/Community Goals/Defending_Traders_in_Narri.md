The Utopia commune has launched a project to build a military
installation in its home system to defend the Sim-Archive from potential
Thargoid attack.\
\
Dr Leigh Constantinides, a spokesperson for Utopia, made this
announcement:\
Following recent observations by the respected strategist Marquis
Novantico, we accept that the Sim-Archive requires increased protection
to prevent its knowledge from falling into the wrong hands. Our partner
organisation, the Narri Justice Party, is therefore overseeing the
construction of a new security installation. We beseech the galactic
community to support this worthy endeavour.\
\
To support this initiative, the Narri Justice Party has launched an
appeal for various construction materials. To protect traders delivering
goods to Bobko City, they have placed a kill order on all ships on its
wanted list operating in the system.
