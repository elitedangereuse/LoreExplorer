Following reports of Thargoid incursions into the core systems, the
Aegis Core has launched a counter-Thargoid operation in the Socho
region.\
\
A spokesperson for the organization gave the following statement to the
media:\
The goal is simple: Take out Thargoid vessels, gather up the pieces, and
deliver them to Dantec Enterprise. We don\'t know as much about the
Scouts as we do the Interceptors, so we want to compare materials from
both variants and find out what they\'re made of.\
\
The Aegis Core has appealed to independent pilots to support the
operation by delivering Bio-Mechanical Conduits, Propulsion Elements and
Weapon Parts to Dantec Enterprise. Commanders who participate in the
operation will be generously rewarded.
