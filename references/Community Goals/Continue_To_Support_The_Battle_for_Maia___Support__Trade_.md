Two weeks ago, conflict erupted between the Ant Hill Mob and the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise in the Maia system. But this was no
ordinary inter-factional dispute. According to various sources, the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise was acting under direct orders from
Federation officials eager to bring Maia under Federal control.\
\
With both sides bolstered by Pilots Federation Commanders, the battle
was intense and wide ranging. After several days of conflict it was the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise that emerged victorious, successfully
gaining a foothold in Maia.\
\
But it seems the battle for Maia is far from over. Recent reports
indicate that the Ant Hill Mob is about to launch a retaliatory assault
with the aim of pushing the Pleiades Resource Enterprise out of Maia.\
\
In addition to targeting Pleiades Resource Enterprise fighters, the Ant
Hill Mob has asked pilots to deliver battle weapons to system security
forces, who will be supporting the Ant Hill Mob during the conflict.\
\
Pilots who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of November 3302 and will run for one
week.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Battle Weapons to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia
system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
