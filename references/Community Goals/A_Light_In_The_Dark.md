The Empire Party, on behalf of the Princess Arissa Lavigny-Duval, is
requesting that any information relating to the recent attack on his
Imperial Highness, the Emperor Hengist Duval, be brought to Simpson
Depot with all haste.\
\
Someone out there knows who was behind the attempt on our Emperor\'s
life, and that\'s information the Princess wants yesterday. Citizens
eager to aid the investigation can do so by interrogating, capturing and
killing Imperial criminals in order to help uncover the truth\
\
Leave no stone unturned, and let no dark corner of our realm be left
unchecked. For make no mistake, whoever was behind this cowardly assault
must be brought to justice.
