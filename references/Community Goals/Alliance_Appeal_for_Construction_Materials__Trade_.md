Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has announced plans to construct a
planetary outpost in the California Nebula. In a statement, Mahon
explained that the new outpost would serve as a centre for
xenobiological and astronomical research. He went on to say:\
\
"We have placed an open order for Geological Equipment, Hazardous
Environment Suits and Surface Stabilisers for use in the construction of
this new outpost, and authorised 160 SOAR to reward pilots who deliver
these materials to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system."\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of December 3302 and will run for two
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Geological Equipment, Hazardous Environment Suits and
Surface Stabilisers to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
