Conflict has erupted between Ross 310 Natural Services, the controlling
faction of the Ross 310 system, and the Ross 310 Cartel, a criminal
organisation also based in Ross 310.\
\
It is understood that the Ross 310 Cartel is attempting to overthrow
Ross 310 Natural Services and assume control of the system.\
\
Toru Jacobs, a member of Ross 310 Natural Services, issued the following
statement:\
\
"The Ross 310 Cartel is well equipped and highly organised, and there\'s
a very real chance they could take control of the system. But the brave
men and women of Ross 310 Natural Services are doing everything they can
to prevent that from happening."\
\
Both organisations have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent
combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict
will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\
\
Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the
system, which will begin on the 29th of March 3304.
