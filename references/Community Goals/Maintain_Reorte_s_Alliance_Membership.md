Deliveries to the Reorte Pro-Alliance League will help determine the
system\'s status.\
\
The system\'s controlling faction, Reorte Mining Coalition, wishes to
declare independence in protest against Sirius Corporation\'s proposed
anti-xeno defence pact with the Alliance Defence Force.\
\
Another faction in the system, the Reorte Pro-Alliance League, broadcast
a statement in opposition by chief administrator Louisa Leblanc:\
\
\"Severing Reorte\'s links with the Alliance over some misguided
idealism would be hasty and short-sighted, given the Thargoid threat
this defence pact is intended to prepare for. We believe that increasing
supplies of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building
fabricators will reassure the public of the security benefits of
membership.\"\
\
\"The Alioth Independents faction has kindly provided a megaship, the
Trobairitz, where pilots can deliver these commodities.\"\
\
Although Sirius Corporation is not officially involved with these
competing initiatives, the megacorp is offering a pre-engineered heat
sink module to independent pilots who make deliveries to the Trobairitz.
The heat sink module has increased ammo at no extra mass, but with a
longer reload time.\
\
- The top 75% of contributors will receive one pre-engineered heat sink
module.\
- The top 50% of contributors will receive two pre-engineered heat sink
modules.\
- The top 25% of contributors will receive three pre-engineered heat
sink modules.\
\
The dual initiatives begin on the 24th of March 3308 and will run for
one week. Should the campaign to support the Reorte Pro-Alliance League
reach the maximum tier it will end immediately.
