The nearby region of Sobek, home to the infamous Sobek Boys, has long
been a hotbed of criminal activity.\
\
Mayor Bailey is concerned that the Sobek Boys may try to make some kind
of move when President Halsey comes to visit the region, as such ha has
authorised members of the Alioth Independents and their allies to end
the Sobek Boys reign of terror once and for all.\
\
Those who assist in Securing Sobek for the Alliance will be eligible for
a range of rewards, including a sliding scale bonus payment scheme.
