Princess Aisling Duval has announced plans to fund a peacekeeping
operation in the Guuguyni system. The operation\'s primary purpose is to
neutralise an illegal slave-trading ring in the region.\
\
Princess Duval released the following statement, elaborating on the
nature of the campaign:\
\
Illegal slavery is an abhorrent practice that negates its victim\'s
fundamental human rights. The amoral profiteers operating in Guuguyni
must be stopped. The Guuguyni Empire Consulate has been authorised to
oversee the campaign, and has pledged to reward pilots who hand in
Bounty Vouchers at Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward you personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
