Also there is a second Goal, Protect the Miners.\

The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has launched a campaign to
construct a state-of-the-art research outpost in the Col 285 Sector IX-T
d3-43 system to support its ongoing research into the Unknown Artefacts.
As part of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order
for palladium, promising to generously reward pilots who deliver the
necessary materials to Thompson Dock in the Varati system.\
\
A spokesperson for the Canonn released a statement to the media:\
\
\"Given the failure of Professor Palin\'s recent attempt to establish a
research outpost in the Maia system, I am aware that certain sections of
the galactic community may receive our request with scepticism. But the
fact is that the study of the Unknown Artefacts is still of great
importance, and it is essential that a dedicated research outpost be
established, far from the civilian population, where they can be safely
investigated.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of March 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
