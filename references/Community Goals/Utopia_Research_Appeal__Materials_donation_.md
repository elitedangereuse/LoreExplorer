The Utopia Commune has issued a request for various commodities to be
used in a forthcoming research and development programme.\
\
The enclave has placed an open order for Zirconium, Conductive Ceramics
and Strange Wake Solutions, and has promised to reward pilots who
deliver these commodities to Cenker City in the Gucumadhyas system.\
\
Simguru Pranav Antal, leader of the Utopian movement, released a
statement outlining the nature of the initiative.\
\
\"We are well aware that independent pilots accumulate large quantities
of material over the course of their travels. Fortunately, Utopia is
willing to pay above-market prices for these materials, which will play
a central role in our forthcoming programme.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 13th of April 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Zirconium, Conductive Ceramics and Strange Wake
Solutions to Cenker City in the Gucumadhyas system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
