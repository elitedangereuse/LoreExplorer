Refugees from the war-torn Pegasi sector have flocked to Ocrinox\'s
Orbiter in the Munshin system, but after spending extended periods on
overcrowded transports, many of them are in dire need of medical
assistance. There is therefore an urgent need for Medicines at
Ocrinox\'s Orbiter with which to treat the sick and wounded.\
\
To help with this effort, Munshin Allied PLC is offering a series of
incentives to pilots who deliver Medicines to Ocrinox\'s Orbiter until
such time as targets have been met.
