A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Santjalan. So
far the illness has defied all attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of the medical staff aboard Cantor Terminal.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that that
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
to assist medical staff aboard Cantor Terminal, the Social Eleu
Progressive Party are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that
provide medicines to Cantor Terminal market until such time as the
crisis has been averted.
