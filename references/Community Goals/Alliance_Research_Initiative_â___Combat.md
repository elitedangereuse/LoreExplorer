Alliance Research Initiative\
\
The Alliance has launched a new research initiative designed to enhance
human understanding of the Thargoids. The primary aim of the initiative
is to build a range of state-of-the-art instruments expressly designed
to analyse Thargoid material.\
\
To this end, the Alliance has placed an open order for Unknown Ship
Signatures, Unknown Organic Circuitry and Unknown Technology Components.
The Kaushpoos Pro-Alliance Union has been authorised to oversee the
campaign, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested
resources to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system. The organisation
has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure
that those delivering resources to Neville Horizons can do so safely.\
\
In a statement, an Alliance spokesperson said:\
\
\"Although humanity has had prior contact with the Thargoids, our
knowledge remains limited. It is essential that we expand our
understanding. We therefore intend to build a range of specialised tools
and analytic instruments with which to study Thargoid material.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of August 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
