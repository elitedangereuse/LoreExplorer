Recent reports from the Gandii system indicate that conflict has erupted
between the Hand Gang of Gandii, an organisation closely allied with
self-styled 'pirate king\' Archon Delaine, and the Gandii Justice
Party.\
\
This is not the first time the Gandii Justice Party has traded blows
with the Hand Gang of Gandii, although the scale of the conflict dwarfs
that of previous skirmishes.\
\
Security forces in Gandii released the following statement:\
\
"Our operatives have confirmed that both factions are offering privateer
bonds to combat pilots who support their cause. But naturally we do not
condone any course of action that could escalate, or perpetuate, this
conflict."\
\
Both the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Gandii Justice Party have set out
week-long operations to overcome their rivals, which will begin on the
6th of April 3303.\

To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds for your chosen side at Lu Hub in the
Gandii system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
