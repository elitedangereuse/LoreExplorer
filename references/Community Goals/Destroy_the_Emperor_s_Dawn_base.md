The Federation has discovered an Emperor\'s Dawn base in the Federal
system of Kausalya. Military analysts speculate that the insurgents may
attempt to use the system as a staging ground for attacks against the
Empire. The Kausalya Netcoms Organisation, on behalf of Federal
President Zachary Hudson has authorised the payment of privateer bonds
to pilots who help drive Emperor\'s Dawn from Kausalya.
