The fighting in the skies above Hartsfield Market is fast and fierce,
but the fighting in the halls of Hartsfield is slow and bloody. To help
the Sons of Conn achieve their objectives on the ground, the Crimson
State Group needs more Weapons to make sure that every freedom fighter
has the equipment they need to strike back against the Federal
oppressors.\
\
Tens of thousands of willing volunteers are currently waiting for the
equipment they need to join the fight. Once enough Weapons have been
obtained, the Sons of Conn will launch a fresh assault on Hartsfield
Market to ensure that it cannot be used as a forward base by Federal
forces attempting to impose the tyrannical orders of the Mars Congress.
