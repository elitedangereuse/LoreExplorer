Safeguard Interstellar requires deliveries of medicines to treat
casualties from the NMLA\'s recent terrorist attack.\
\
CEO Noel Beaumont announced:\
\
\"Hundreds of thousands of civilians still require urgent medical
attention after being evacuated from the damaged stations. Many have
severe caustic burns inflicted by the corrosive enzyme payload of the
explosives. We have already exhausted the majority of supplies in nearby
systems.\"\
\
\"To reinforce overstretched health services, we request shipments of
basic medicines and advanced medicines. These can be delivered to
Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system.\"\
\
Safeguard Interstellar has partnered with Lavigny\'s Legion to reward
pilots and distribute the medicines.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 75% of participants will receive a
permanent Achenar system permit and a fully engineered class 3 rating A
Shield Generator with thermal and kinetic resistance. The module will be
placed in storage at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system by the 26th
of March 3307.\
\
The joint initiative will run for one week. If the final target is met
earlier than planned, the initiative will end immediately.
