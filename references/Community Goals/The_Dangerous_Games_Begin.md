The galaxy is home to countless factions, some boasting thousands of
members and others comprising only a handful of individuals. Some exist
to serve the galactic community, while others follow more antagonistic
dogmas. For almost every creed in human space, there is a corresponding

\'Wildcard\' events will enter the Dangerous Games, competing for the

The first Wildcard event requires pilots to fire up their mining lasers
and gather gold for their chosen faction. The f
