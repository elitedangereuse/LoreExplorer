The Balones Gold Touch Systems has placed an open order for materials
for use in a forthcoming project. A bulletin from the organisation
confirms that pilots who deliver mined Osmium, Praseodymium and Methanol
Monohydrate Crystals to Tiedemann Dock in the Balones system will be
generously rewarded.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation elaborated on the nature of the
project:\
\
\"The purpose of this programme is to develop a number of advanced
deep-space probes -- ones that will reveal more about what lies beyond
the borders of our galaxy.\"\
\
\"We at Balones Gold Touch Systems believe galactic civilisation is on
the cusp of a paradigm shift. The alien shipwrecks and the Synuefe ruins
leave no room for doubt: we are not alone in the universe.\"\
\
\"Knowledge is the currency of the future. Not money. Not weapons.
Knowledge. And how best to acquire this knowledge? With the instruments
that Balones Gold Touch Systems is developing.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of January 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering mined Osmium, Praseodymium and Methanol Monohydrate
Crystals to Tiedemann Dock in the Balones system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
