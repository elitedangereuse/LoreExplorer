The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has launched a campaign to establish a
planetary outpost in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. According to the
organisation\'s spokesperson, the primary purpose of the new outpost
will be to support independent trade and exploration in the region.\
\
In a statement, the spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the
campaign:\
\
"Well, the arrival of Jaques triggered a real surge in interest in Eol
Prou. And since the system is pretty remote, there\'s a clear need for
an outpost to support pilots ferrying material to and from the starport.
That\'s in the short term. There\'s also a desire among the galactic
community to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou, so hopefully
this campaign will be the start of something bigger."\
\
The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has placed an open order for mined Osmium
for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who
deliver material to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system.
The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for four
weeks.\
