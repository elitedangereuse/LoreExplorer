Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have requested
deliveries of mined resources to the LTT 198 system.\
\
LTT 198 State Ltd, its controlling faction, will only allow one of the
rival corporations to remain permanently. The company with the most
successful campaign will establish a new starport in the
permit-controlled system, which is scheduled to enter operation on the
2nd of September 3307.\
\
Senator Zemina Torval, who has sole control of the Mastopolos Mining
subsidiary, announced:\
\
\"My company is working on an experimental mining laser with increased
range. To achieve this, shipments of coltan, gallite, praseodymium and
silver must be delivered in sufficient numbers to the megaship Pride of
Bitterwood in LTT 198.\"\
\
LTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives
with temporary system permits lasting one week.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 10% of participants will receive a fully
engineered class 1 rating D mining laser with long range. The module
will be placed in storage at the Pride of Bitterwood in EGM 559 by
Friday the 27th of August 3307.\
\
Should Torval-Mastopolos Mining be victorious the top 75% of
participants will receive the module along with permanent permit access
to LTT 198.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 26th of August 3307. If one faction meets its objectives
earlier than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
