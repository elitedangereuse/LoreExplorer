An initiative to gather data on potential tourist destinations has been
launched by shipbuilding corporation Saud Kruger.\
\
The manufacturer of luxury passenger ships aims to identify Earth-like
worlds that would be suitable for holiday trips. These will be run by
its subsidiary, Astrogator Tours.\
\
CEO Stanislav Kruger announced the campaign to the press:\
\
\"We are keen to acquire data on Earth-like worlds, to assess their
suitability as destinations for future holidaymakers seeking the
adventure of a lifetime. However, all exploration data is valuable and
will earn generous payments.\"\
\
\"In addition, our marketing department is keen to receive images of
eye-catching sights found within unpopulated systems containing earth
like worlds, to spot the most potentially exciting additions to the
Astrogator Tours catalogue.\"\
\
Contributing pilots are invited to deliver exploration data to Youll
Port in the Vistaenis system. They can also submit their most compelling
images by the 30th of September. By the 28th of October, the most
suitable locations will receive tourist beacons and where appropriate
credit the commander for their submission.\
\
Although Saud Kruger is paying handsomely for all exploration data, it
is the data on Earth-like worlds that will really progress the research,
with data from mapped Earth-like worlds being three times as useful.\
\
Depending on the tier reached, Saud Kruger will offer reductions on the
entire range of Saud Kruger ships as well as luxury passenger cabins
from the 1st of October 3307 lasting one week.\
Tier 1 will provide a 10% discount. Each additional tier will provide a
further 5% discount up to a maximum of 30%.\
There will also be a livery discount on Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner
paint jobs at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% based on the tier reached over
the same period.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached:\
The top 75% of contributors will receive a class 3 Business Cabin.\
The top 50% of contributors will also receive class 5 First Class
Cabin.\
The top 25% of contributors will also receive a Dolphin in Prestige
Yellow.\
The top 10% of contributors will also receive an Orca in Prestige
Yellow.\
The top 10 contributors will also receive a Beluga Liner in Prestige
Yellow.\
\
These rewards will be in place by the end of Friday the 1st of October.\
\
This initiative will run for one week. If the final target is met
earlier than planned, the initiative will end immediately.
