Authorities in the LP 128-32 system have reported a sharp increase in
the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, LP 128-32 Corporation has placed a kill order on
all ships on their wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who
deliver bounty vouchers.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Bulychev Hub in the LP 128-32 system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
