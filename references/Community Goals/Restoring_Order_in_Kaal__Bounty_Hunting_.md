Authorities in the Kaal system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Kuk Silver Fortune Company has placed a kill
order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver bounty vouchers to Vercors Station.\
\
The campaign begins on 17th of August 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Vercors Station in the Kaal system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward you personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
