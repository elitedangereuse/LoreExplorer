Over the past year, the Qa\'wakana system has become a focal point for
the Knights of Karma, a rapidly expanding organisation that has
attracted support from across the galaxy. Now the group has announced
plans to establish a new mining facility among the rings of Qa\'wakana
6.\
\
A spokesman for the organisation released a statement regarding the
proposal.\
\
"Plans for the facility are underway, but we will need the support of
the galactic community if the project is to succeed. We are therefore
offering generous remuneration to pilots who deliver construction
materials to Carpini Terminal in the Qa\'wakana system."\
\
The spokesperson added that the organisation had placed a kill order on
all ships on its wanted list.\
\
"The construction of this new facility is sure to aggravate those who
want to preserve the status quo, and we are expecting resistance. So
we\'re asking combat pilots to help us protect innocent traders from
persecution."\
\
The campaign begins on the 8th of June 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Carpini Terminal in the Qa\'wakana
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
