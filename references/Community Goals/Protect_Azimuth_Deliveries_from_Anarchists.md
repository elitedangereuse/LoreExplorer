Azimuth Biotech has announced a campaign in the Wandrama system to
expand its military and surface facility capacity.\
\
The controversial weapons developer has seen a recent downturn in
fortunes, due to fierce opposition by independent pilots protesting
Azimuth\'s history of illicit research.\
\
Azimuth Biotech CEO Torben Rademaker announced the initiative:\
\
\"After a period of reflection, it is time for Azimuth to once again
step forward and assume a position of support for the brave pilots
engaging Thargoid forces wherever they are encountered. To do this, we
shall establish a new megaship equipped to operation in Thargoid-tainted
systems. The tragic loss of the Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus in
HIP 22460 must not hinder our ambition any further.\"\
\
Within hours of the announcement, opponents of Azimuth Biotech had
organised a counter-campaign to prevent deliveries from reaching
Wandrama. Combat between Azimuth security forces and anti-Azimuth
activists has been reported in the system. In response, Azimuth is
hosting a combat initiative from the Musashi megaship alongside the
ongoing delivery campaign.\
\
Azimuth Biotech has offered the following rewards to attract support
from independent pilots:\
\
The top 75% of contributors will receive one Fixed-Mount, Class 2
Overcharged Guardian Plasma Charger.\
The top 25% of contributors will receive two Fixed-Mount, Class 2
Overcharged Guardian Plasma Chargers.\
\
The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of
the system, which will begin on the 3rd November 3308.
