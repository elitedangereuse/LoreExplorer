Professor Ishmael Palin has shocked medical personnel at Wilkes Orbital
by returning to work only hours after he received the antidote to the
Cerberus Plague. According to Palin\'s doctor, the professor was eager
to talk to Lea Tantaga, the molecular chemist who recently developed a
material capable of countering the Unknown Artefacts\' self-repair
mechanism. The scientists\' conversation resulted in the following
statement from Professor Palin:\
\
\"The significance of Professor Tantaga\'s breakthrough is clear: the
means to safely contain the Unknown Artefacts is now within our grasp.
What we need now are quantities of meta-alloys so we can produce more of
the UA-resistant material.\"\
\
A conglomerate based in the Maia system has pledged to support the
appeal by mass-producing the UA-resistant material, assuming sufficient
quantities of meta-alloys are received. This will then be used to create
special ship modules that can safely transport the Unknown Artefacts.\
\
The Pioneer\'s Cooperative has placed an open order for meta-alloys, and
has promised to generously reward pilots who contribute to the
initiative. The campaign begins on the 24th March 3302 and will run for
one week.\
