Emperor\'s Dawn has issued an open contract for Ceremonial Heike Tea
with which to fulfil various commercial commitments. The organisation
has access to considerable reserves, and is offering a series of
generous incentives to pilots who deliver Ceremonial Heike Tea to
Sikorsky Orbital until such time as its targets have been met.
