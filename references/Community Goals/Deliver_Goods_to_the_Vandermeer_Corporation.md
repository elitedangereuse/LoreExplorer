Professor Katrien Rook of Vitadyne Labs has launched an initiative to
establish a new pharmaceutical production facility.\
\
In a statement, Professor Rook said:\
\
\"Vitadyne Labs lacks the infrastructure to mass-produce nanomedicines,
so we have invited two pharmaceutical companies to bid for a
distribution licence. The company that puts forward the most convincing
proposal will secure the contract.\"\
\
The companies in question are Neomedical Industries, which supplies
Alliance and independent systems, and the Vandermeer Corporation, which
operates exclusively within Federal space. Both have requested advanced
medicines, computer components and auto fabricators for the construction
of nanomed manufacturing plants.\
\
Deliveries for the Vandermeer Corporation should be made to the Liberals
of Kuma at Elion Dock in the Kuma system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 24th of January 3305 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Advanced Medicines, Computer Components and Auto
Fabricators to Elion Dock in the Kuma system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes and other disruptive events can
negatively impact markets and station services, and could prevent the
initiative from running smoothly.\
