Jupiter Division ships have engaged in battle with rival Federal vessels
in the HIP 54530 system.\
\
Loyalists to former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester have built their
own breakaway faction in HIP 54530. The FIA suspects that Jupiter
Division agents first infiltrated the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group
years ago, and permit locked the system to conceal their efforts to
overtake it from within.\
\
The self-appointed Supreme Executive Rochester declared:\
\
\"The Federation is choking to death on its outdated bureaucracy -- only
corporate rule can save it! But first the galactic community must
protect my followers, so I can establish a permanent base of
operations.\"\
\
Jupiter Division has offered generous rewards to any pilots willing to
help secure its presence in the HIP 54530 system by handing in Combat
Bonds at the megaship Victory\'s Forge.\
\
The Pilots Federation has agreed to supply all ships participating in
this conflict with temporary permits to access HIP 54530. These will
expire early on Thursday the 18th of February. However, neither
permanent nor temporary system permits apply to fleet carriers, since
they are capable of ferrying vessels which could evade detection and
authorisation.\
\
If victorious, each tier beyond Tier 1 will provide a 5% reduction to
outfitting at Northrop Enterprise in HIP 54530 to those with access to
the system, lasting for one month starting on Friday the 19th of
February 3307.\
The top 75% of contributors will be allocated a permanent system permit
for HIP 54530 by Friday the 19th of February 3307.\
\
Early on Thursday the 18th of February 3307, the Jupiter Division
megaship Victory\'s Forge will move to HIP 55014. If victorious, it will
be authorised to issue permanent system permits to those who meet their
requirements.\
\
The two factions have set out six-day campaigns, which will end early on
Wednesday the 17th of February 3307.
