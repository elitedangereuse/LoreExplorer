The Peacock Patrons of Law have placed an open order for Robotics, Ion
Distributors and Emergency Power Cells. The organisation has promised to
reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Phillips Dock in the
Peacock system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th February 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Robotics, Ion Distributors and Emergency Power Cells
to Phillips Dock in the Peacock system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
