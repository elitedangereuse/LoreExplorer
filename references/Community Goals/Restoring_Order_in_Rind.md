Authorities in the Rind system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots traveling in the system, disrupting trade
and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Rind Gold Electronics Org has placed a kill
order on all ships on their wanted list and has promised to reward
pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Wegner Market.
