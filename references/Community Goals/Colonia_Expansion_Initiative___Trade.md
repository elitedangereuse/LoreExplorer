As the Colonia community continues to grow, the Junkyard Dogs have
placed an open order for various commodities to support another wave of
expansion.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed the materials would be
used to construct new outposts in the region. The amount of materials
received will determine exactly how many outposts are built.\
\
The Junkyard Dogs have promised to reward pilots who deliver Tantalum,
Silver and Power Generators to their base of operations at Tolagarf\'s
Junkyard.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of June 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Tantalum, Silver and Power Generators to Tolagarf\'s
Junkyard in the EOL Prou Lw-L C8-215 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
