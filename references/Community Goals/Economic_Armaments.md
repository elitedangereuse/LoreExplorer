The Wolf 406 Transport Co is pleased to announce the formation of a new
partnership with Lakon Spaceway. The deal, which will see Hamilton
Gateway become one of the largest producers of the local economy.\
\
There is however, one small problem. Lakon Spaceways has insisted that
the shipyards aboard Hamilton Gateway be made for large scale production
within the next two weeks, or else the deal will be off.\
\
If the Lakon contract is lost, other recently acquired contracts may
also come under threat. As such, the Wolf 406 Transport Co Corporation
is currently offering a number of bonuses to any pilots who can help
supply the Metals needed for the ongoing refurbishment effort.
