A terrifying disease is currently working its way through HIP 10175. So
far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Stefanyshyn-Piper Station.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Stefanyshyn-Piper Station, the People\'s
HIP 10175 for Equality are offering a series of incentives to any pilots
that provide medicines to Stefanyshyn-Piper Station market until such
time as the crisis has been averted.
