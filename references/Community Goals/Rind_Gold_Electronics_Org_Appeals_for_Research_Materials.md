The Empire has announced an initiative to bolster the superpower\'s
military strength. The initiative centres on a new training programme
designed to create the next generation of starship pilots.\
\
A spokesperson for the Rind Gold Electronics Org, which is overseeing
the initiative, released the following statement:\
Over the past six months, a research group based in Achenar has
developed a state-of-the-art training programme designed to cultivate
applicants\' reflexes, coordination, perception and cognitive abilities.
Provisional tests indicate that students in the full flush of youth,
unburdened with superfluous knowledge, respond extremely well to the
programme, resulting in combat pilots of unprecedented skill.\
\
In support of this initiative, the Rind Gold Electronics Org has placed
an open order for research materials, which will be used to manufacture
essential apparatus.
