Cooper Research Associates have launched a rescue operation to recover
personal effects, data and people from Thargoid attack sites in the
Pleiades Nebula.\
\
The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver Occupied
Escape Pods, Damaged Escape Pods, Black Boxes and Personal Effects to
the search-and-rescue contact at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W
d1-55 system.\
\
A spokesperson for Cooper Research Associates released a brief
statement:\
Eyewitnesses have reported that Thargoid vessels are taking occupied
escape pods from ships they have attacked. It is therefore essential
that we recover any and all individuals from these attack sites before
they can be similarly abducted.
