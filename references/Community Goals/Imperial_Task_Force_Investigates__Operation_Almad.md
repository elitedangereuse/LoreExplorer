Arissa\'s Investigators have obtained information which indicates that
certain criminal elements within Almad have ties to the group that
conspired to kill the Emperor.\
\
Member\'s of the Princess\'s personal coterie have already begun
questioning the local crime lords, but unsurprisingly most are refusing
to cooperate.\
\
In an effort to encourage the normally silent members of our society to
speak more freely, the princess has requested that combat pilots loyal
to the house of Duval express their displeasure by forcing each and
every pirate within 20 light years of Almad out of the skies.
