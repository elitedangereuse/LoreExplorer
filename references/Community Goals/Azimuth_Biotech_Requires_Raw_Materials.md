Azimuth Biotech has called on mining vessels to deliver raw materials to
the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 157 system.\
\
The campaign was launched by the corporation\'s acting CEO, Torben
Rademaker:\
\
\"Our mission to continue developing anti-xeno technologies is currently
hampered by a lack of resources to establish new facilities. Azimuth\'s
investment in the Proteus Wave project and related infrastructure was
considerable. Meanwhile, the reckless actions of anarchists and
political extremists have inhibited our recovery.\"\
\
\"Generous credit payments are being offered for the following mined
metals: cobalt, gallite and osmium. Shipments of these can be delivered
to the Glorious Prospect, where they will be processed for a variety of
uses. Dedicated contributors of these freshly mined ores will be granted
a permit to the Mbooni system, should they not already have it, and
access to our range of hybrid anti-xeno modules at Prospect\'s Deep.\"\
\
As well as credit rewards, the top 75% of contributors will receive the
Mbooni permit if the initiative is a success.\
\
Azimuth Biotech has set out a seven day campaign, which will end early
on Thursday September 8th 3308.
