Authorities in the Mehet system have reported that the number of
criminals operating in the area has risen sharply over the past few
months. Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking
pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing
discord.\
\
To counter this threat, Mehet Ltd has placed a kill order on all wanted
ships operating in the Mehet system, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver bounty vouchers to Schwann Dock.\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of June 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
