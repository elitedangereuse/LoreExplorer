The Simbad Regime was established over a year ago, and has enjoyed
consistent growth with the support of Commanders across the galaxy. Now
the group has announced plans to construct a new asteroid base among the
rings of Nu Tauri 5.\
\
In support of this goal, the Simbad Regime has placed an open order for
various construction materials. They have also placed a kill order on
all ships on their wanted list and promised to reward pilots who hand in
bounty vouchers at Parmitano Terminal in the Nu Tauri system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Parmitano Terminal in the Nu Tauri system. Only
bounty vounchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
