Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems aim to improve
journeys to the distant colonies.\
\
The Colonia Bridge project is being funded by Brewer Corporation, which
outlined the details in a press release:\
\
\"The Colonia region has great potential for businesses and travellers,
but the long voyage can be prohibitive. Brewer Corporation is investing
in the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and
Colonia, to make crossing those thousands of light years easier.\"\
\
\"Up to 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the route to Colonia,
providing travellers with valuable respite and resources including
tritium. These stationary megaships should be operational by the 28th of
October, and will mark the completion of the first phase of the
three-phase Colonia Bridge project. Its aim is to place dockable
megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the
Alcor and Colonia systems.\"\
\
\"To achieve this, we require large quantities of Ceramic Composites,
Computer Components and Thermal Cooling Units. These can be delivered to
Jaques Station in the Colonia system.\"\
\
Brewer Corporation has confirmed that as well as offering payment for
the materials, it will ask the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia
to submit potential names for the new dockable megaships. Submissions
will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.\
\
The Colonia Council is subsidising this part of the initiative, due to
the importance of this enterprise. As a consequence, the commodity
requirements for the megaships at Jaques station are reduced.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to add the following to
the Colonia Bridge route for the 28th of October 3307.\
Tier 1: 1 dockable megaship\
Tier 2: 1 additional dockable megaship\
Tier 3: 1 additional dockable megaship\
Tier 4: 1 additional dockable megaship\
Tier 5: 1 additional dockable megaship\
\
Additionally, Brewer Corporation will offer reductions to Fleet Carriers
and Fleet Carrier outfitting at Jaques Station in the Colonia system,
based on the tier reached. These will last for one week starting on
Friday the 15th of October 3307.\
Tier 1 will provide a 10% discount. Each additional tier will provide a
further 5% discount, up to a maximum of 30%.\
\
The campaign begins on the 7th of October 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
