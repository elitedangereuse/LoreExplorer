Caine Massey and Torval Mining Ltd are running rival campaigns to
deliver mined commodities to the Dulos system.\
\
For the past decade, the megacorp Caine Massey has supplied ore and
other raw materials to several subsidiaries in the region. But with the
contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd is making a bid for the
lucrative business.\
\
Constantia Torval, operations director for the Empire-based company,
outlined the initiative:\
\
\"We are calling upon pilots to provide the following mined materials:
bromellite, samarium and gallite. These should be delivered to the Pride
of Bitterwood in the Dulos system. Your assistance will directly support
our proposal to win this contract and expand our entire enterprise.\"\
\
The corporate distributors within the region have agreed that whichever
candidate is able to provide the greatest amount of materials will be
awarded the contract for the next decade.\
\
Should Torval Mining Ltd be successful, an initial 10% price reduction
will be applied to all mining modules offered at the Pride of Bitterwood
megaship. A further 5% reduction will be applied per tier reached. This
discount will be available for two weeks.\
\
The two factions have set out seven day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday 20th January 3308. If one faction meets its objectives
earlier than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
