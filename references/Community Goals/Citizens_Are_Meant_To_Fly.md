The Princess Lavigny-Duval has paced a sizeable order for a new fleet of
Imperial Clippers with the shipwrights of Nu.\
\
In order to ensure the success of the project, the Citizens of Tradition
will be working directly with the Gutamaya Corporation. Gutamaya has
placed a number of orders calling for the shipment of 5,000,000 tonnes
of Metals to be brought to the shipyard aboard Syromyatnikov Horizons.\
\
An incentive scheme has been put in place to ensure that all traders are
properly compensated for diverting away from their normal trade routes.
