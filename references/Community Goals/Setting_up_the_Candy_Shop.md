The Candy Crew Guild, an independent corporate organisation based in the
Irusan system, has announced plans to establish a capital shipyard and a
scientific-research vessel in its home system, and has placed an open
order for various commodities for use in the construction.\
\
Commander Raijiin, head of the organisation, elaborated on the nature of
the campaign:\
\
\"We need quantities of palladium, titanium and robotics, and we
encourage all able and willing pilots to assist us.\"\
\
\"We are expecting the initiative to attract agitators, but security in
the system has been increased, and many of our own wings are patrolling
the trade lanes, to ensure no crime goes unpunished.\"\
\
The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested
commodities to Bella Port in the Irusan system.\
\
The campaign begins on 28th of September 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
