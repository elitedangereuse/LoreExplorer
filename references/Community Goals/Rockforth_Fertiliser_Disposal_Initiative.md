The Rockforth Corporation\'s EX7 fertiliser has been linked to the
blight affecting crops in a number of systems, prompting an initiative
to remove the product from the market.​\
\
Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture
delivered an urgent [message:​\\\\](message:​\\)\
\"Comparative analysis has confirmed that the blight is caused by the
EX7 fertiliser. The original poor harvests have been attributed to
natural factors, and it is now thought that the situation could have
been contained had the fertiliser not exacerbated the problem. Initial
food shortages were offset by a recent trade appeal in the Diso and
Orerve systems, but the blight\'s symptoms have since been reported in
hundreds of systems. While we investigate the reasons for this rapid
spread, preventing further fertiliser distribution is vital.\"\
\
Rockforth fertiliser can now be collected at negligible cost from the
following markets: ​\
\
- Sharon Lee Free Market, Orrere\
- Lave Station, Lave\
- Warinus, Lave\
- Shifnalport, Diso\
- Davies High, Reorte\
- Watson Station, Orerve\
- Roentgen Hub, LFT 37\
- Macedo Station, Lei Zi\
- Phillips Gateway, Ensoreus\
- Baird Gateway, Arque\
- La Soeur du Dan Ham, Riedquat\
\
The Teveri Progressive Party has arranged for the safe disposal of the
fertiliser and has offered to compensate pilots for their efforts. The
fertiliser should be delivered to Wiley Port in the Teveri system.​\
\
To expedite this initiative, Lakon Spaceways has agreed to lower the
cost of the Type-6 Transporter, Type-7 Transporter and Type-9 Heavy.
Cargo rack prices have also been reduced in all starports.​
