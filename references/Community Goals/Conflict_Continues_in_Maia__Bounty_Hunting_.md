Early reports from the Maia system indicate that the Ant Hill Mob has
delivered a significant blow to the Pleiades Resource Enterprise. The
news comes less than 24 hours after the criminal organisation launched
an operation to push the PRE out of Maia.\
\
It is understood the Ant Hill Mob leveraged its connections in Maia\'s
criminal network to achieve its aims in a remarkably short amount of
time.\
\
But the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is not out of the fight yet. The
organisation has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in
Maia and the surrounding systems, and has promised to reward pilots who
deliver bounty vouchers to Obsidian Orbital.\
\
The campaign will run from the 11th to the 17th of November 3302. If the
final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\

[Notes:\\\\](Notes:\\)

-   Obsidian Orbital has Restock, Refuel & Repair facilities but no

Outfitting or Shipyard\
- Local Outfitting can be found at Darnielle\'s Progress & Maia Point on
Maia A 2 b for those with Horizons\
- Nearest starport with Outfitting is Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis, 177 Ly
away\
- Nearest Shipyard is also at Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis\
- Since Maia is an Anarchy, a KWS will likely be a useful addition!\
