Azimuth Biotech urgently requires deliveries of Guardian artefacts to
HIP 22460 as vital components of the Proteus Wave.\
\
Salvation issued an official request to the Allied, Federal and Imperial
taskforces, which was then shared via public channels:\
\
\"We have now begun assembly of the Proteus Wave. Our existing stockpile
of Guardian material was sufficient to begin construction, but we must
now establish a supply line capable of delivering the quantity needed to
finish the weapon.\"\
\
\"Azimuth Biotech has established an initiative to encourage independent
pilots to supply the Bright Sentinel megaship with Guardian commodities.
Azimuth are also offering additional ship liveries to contributors.\"\
\
Pilots can deliver any combination of Guardian caskets, orbs, relics,
tablets, totems and urns to the Bright Sentinel megaship in the HIP
22460 system.\
\
The top 75% of contributors will recieve will receive an Azimuth
Deliverance paintjob for the Krait Mk II, Eagle and Fer-de-Lance.\
\
The first stage of the campaign begins on the 5th July 3308 and will run
for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.
