The Federal astrocartography department has issued a public request for
Exploration Data. Mark Devene, head of the department, elaborated on the
nature of the appeal:\
\
"We are looking for data from three specific zones in order to verify
certain hypotheses. We want high-quality information on system
configurations, planet types, spectral classes and compositions."\
\
"We are looking at the following coordinates: PLAA AEC IZ-N C20-1, PRU
AESCS DL-W C15-37 and EAFOTS EU-R C4-1. Explorers might be more familiar
with the colloquial names for these areas -- Hawkin\'s Gap, the Conflux
and the Formidine Rift. Pilots should travel to one of these locations
and investigate out to a radius of 200 light years."\
\
The Tau Ceti Crimson Legal Solutions has volunteered to coordinate the
operation and has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data
to Gilmour Orbiter in the Tau Ceti system. The campaign begins on the
17th of November 3302 and will run for two weeks.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Exploration Data to Gilmour Orbiter in the Tau Ceti
system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for two weeks, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly\
