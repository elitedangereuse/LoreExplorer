Wandrama Purple Council has stated it will lead efforts to prevent
Azimuth Biotech\'s asset expansion campaign from succeeding.\
\
Azimuth, the controversial weapons developer, has seen a recent downturn
in fortunes due to fierce opposition by independent pilots protesting
its history of illicit research. The failure of Salvation to bring an
end to the war has also soured public sentiment towards the
corporation.\
\
A spokesperson for the \'anti-Azimuth\' coalition simply stated:
\"Azimuth\'s continued operation is a stain on the conscience of
humanity. The sooner this shameless corporation is dissolved, the
better. We aim to ensure its leaders face justice for the many crimes
they have perpetrated.\"\
\
Opponents of Azimuth Biotech have joined this counter-campaign to
prevent deliveries from reaching the Musashi megaship. Combat between
Azimuth security forces and anti-Azimuth activists has been reported in
the Wandrama system. It is believed that efforts to derail the campaign
are being directed from MacLean City.\
\
To attract pilots to its cause, Wandrama Purple Council has offered the
following weapon rewards:\
\
The top 75% of contributors will receive one Fixed-mount, Class 2 Rapid
Fire Multi-cannon.\
The top 25% of contributors will receive two Fixed-mount, Class 2 Rapid
Fire Multi-cannons.\
\
The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of
the system, which will begin on the 3rd November 3308.
