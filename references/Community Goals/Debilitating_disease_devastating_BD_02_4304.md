A terrifying disease is currently working its way through BD-02 4304. So
far the illness has defied all attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Newton Dock.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quatantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Newton Dock, the Democrats of BD-02 4304
are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that provide medicines
to Newton Dock market until such time as the crisis has been averted.
