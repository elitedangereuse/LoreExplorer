Citizens of the Bhagui system are attempting to resurrect the ancient
Oktoberfest celebration, an annual event based on a centuries-old Earth
tradition.\
\
The scale of the event is unprecedented, and local suppliers are reeling
due to the weight of demand. Consequently, Mould Federal Mining
Incorporated has volunteered to finance an emergency initiative that
will supply the required resources.\
\
A spokesperson for the company issued the following statement:\
This will be a party like no other, where people can come together to
celebrate life, love and beer. We are honoured to play our part in
supporting a festival such as this. Nothing is more important to us than
helping our communities.\
\
Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has placed an open order for Animal
Meat, Fish and Beer, promising to reward pilots who deliver these
commodities to Leavitt Port in the Bhagui system.
