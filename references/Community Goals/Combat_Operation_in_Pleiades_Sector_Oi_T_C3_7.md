Following the success of last month\'s Federal-Imperial operation in the
HIP 17692 system, the two superpowers have once again joined forces to
combat the Thargoids.\
\
This time, the operation will focus on the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7
system, where large concentrations of Thargoid ships have been
reported.\
\
The purpose of the two-pronged operation is to reduce the Thargoid
presence in Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7, and to recover black boxes and
personal effects from Thargoid attack sites in the system. The former
initiative is being overseen by the Merope Expeditionary Fleet. Pilots
who support these operations will be eligible for substantial rewards.\
\
Admiral Denton Patreus launched the campaign with the following
statement:\
We know that militias of experienced combat pilots are particularly
effective against the Thargoids, but we must not be complacent. Our
enemies are formidable, and we underestimate them at our peril.
