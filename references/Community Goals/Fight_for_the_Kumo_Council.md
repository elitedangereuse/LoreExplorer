The Kumo Council has declared war on the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group
for the latter\'s role in supporting Neomedical Industries.\
\
The pharmaceutical corporation\'s recent campaign in the Haithis system
enabled the mass production of onionhead gamma strain, scheduled to be
available as a medicinal product from Alliance and independent markets.
The drug is currently distributed in a handful of anarchy systems by the
Kumo Crew syndicate.\
\
As hostilities erupted in the Haithis system, Archon Delaine broadcast a
message for Neomedical Industries:\
\
\"Did you truly believe you could steal from us and survive unscathed?
Now your allies will pay for your greed with their blood.\"\
\
The Kumo Council intends to prevent the scheduled distribution of
onionhead gamma strain as a medicinal commodity from Alliance and
independent markets. Success would keep onionhead gamma strain\'s supply
limited to anarchy systems selected by the Kumo Crew.\
\
Pilots supporting this effort can deliver combat bonds to The Mictlan
megaship in the Haithis system.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 16th
of September 3307.
