Recent reports from Jotunheim indicate that the Autocracy of Jotunheim,
an Imperial-aligned organisation, has entered the system with a remit to
bring it under Imperial control.\
Regional authorities have opposed the incursion, and have authorised the
Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim
from the system. The Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance has also issued
a call to independent combat pilots for support, promising to reward
those who lend their aid. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has issued a
similar plea.\
Meanwhile, peace activist Jasmina Halsey has surprised commentators by
placing an open order for Armour, Performance Enhancers and Military
Grade Fabrics, which she has pledged to donate to the Revolutionary
Jotunheim Resistance in support of its operation. The Yum Kamcabi Purple
Life Industry is coordinating Halsey\'s appeal.\
Anticipating the furore her decision would cause, Halsey released the
following statement:\
"I know I will be criticised for intervening in this conflict. But if
those who oppose this war believe it can be stopped through peaceful
protest alone, they are mistaken. If we do not help the people of
Jotunheim, they will lose their homeland. We cannot stand idly by."\
The campaign begins on the 1st of June 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Reactive Armour, Performance Enhancers and Military
Grade Fabrics to The Harmony megaship in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
