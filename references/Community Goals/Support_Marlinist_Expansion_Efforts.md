A delivery campaign in the HIP 22550 system will help build additional
starports for the Marlinist Colonies.\
\
First Minister Octavia Volkov delivered this public address:\
\
\"The Marlinist Colonies were born out of desperation, but we have
evolved into a fully fledged society. Emperor Arissa has formally
accepted our status as an autonomous democracy, albeit one that retains
cultural and historical ties with the Empire.\"\
\
\"To celebrate and consolidate our independence, we have launched an
initiative to construct up to six new orbital stations. For all those
who wish to take part, we require shipments of aluminium, computer
components, power generators and titanium to be transported to Stillman
Hub starport.\"\
\
The Free Marlinists of Carinae faction has confirmed that it will offer
rewards to pilots who deliver the necessary materials to Stillman Hub in
the HIP 22550 system.\
\
For each tier that is reached, one new starport will be constructed
within a Marlinist Colony system, up to a maximum of six starports.\
