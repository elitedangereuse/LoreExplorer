The Kingfisher megaship has requested supplies for its planned journey
to greet the first rogue signal source.\
\
Shipments of basic medicines, fruit and vegetables are required for the
Kingfisher\'s crew, who will be joined by over 3,000 supporters of the
Thargoid Advocacy Project. Muon Imagers and semiconductors have also
been requested to establish the mission\'s communications arrays, which
are being designed to initiate contact with the Thargoids.\
\
Congressman Dalton Chase gave a press statement regarding the
initiative:\
\
\"Now that we know the approaching anomalies are Thargoid, many are
concerned that hostilities between our species will escalate. However, a
brave group of volunteers see this as an opportunity to prove that
diplomacy can work. An alien race has sent emissaries toward humanity\'s
space, and it is our duty to meet them with words rather than
weapons.\"\
\
\"The first of the anomalies, which we have named Taranis, is predicted
to pass through Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1. Using the high-level protocols
available to Congress, I have successfully obtained a temporary access
restriction that grants an exclusive permit to the Kingfisher. A range
of broadcasts using multiple techniques will try to attract the
Thargoids\' attention. Hopefully, the entity will slow down long enough
to give some acknowledgement of these attempts.\"\
\
The delivery initiative in the Andavandul system is being managed by
Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar.\
\
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
