To commemorate the anniversary of the so-called \'Bacon Protests\', in
which militant animal rights activists mounted several pro-vegetarianism
rallies , a cooperative of independent pilots known as the Bacon Cats is
organising a celebration at Bacon City in the Carnoeck system.\
\
The events sponsors, United Carnoeck for Equality, have submitted a
request for Narcotics, and have set aside a quantity of credits for
pilots who contribute to this effort.\
