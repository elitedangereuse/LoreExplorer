With Thargoid attacks becoming a regular occurrence in the Pleiades
Nebula, Aegis has leveraged its considerable reserves to fund a military
operation in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The initiative, dubbed
'Operation Andronicus\', has been expressly conceived to counter
Thargoid aggression in the region.\
\
Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis\'s chief military liaison, elaborated on the
nature of the initiative:\
Personal-scale craft are particularly effective against Thargoid
vessels, not least because of the comparative vulnerability of
capital-class ships. I therefore believe the most effective way to
address the Thargoid threat -- in the short term at least -- is a
militia of seasoned combat pilots. Aegis has agreed to finance this
initiative, which will aim to deliver a strategic blow to the Thargoids
in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.\
\
Aegis Research has confirmed that it will reward pilots who hand in
Pilots Federation Combat Bonds at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W
d1-55.
