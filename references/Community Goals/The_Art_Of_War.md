Over the years Senator Patreus has amassed an impressive collection of
private military industrial companies and corporations. As a result the
Senator\'s interests are spread across the length and breadth of the
Empire, positioning Patreus as one of the premier suppliers of Imperial
Armaments in the entire galaxy.\
\
Traditionally Eotienses has been left untouched by the Senator\'s
business, but now the time has finally come for an upgrade. Senator
Patreus has pledged to spend billions of credits in rejuvenating
Eotienses\'s economy over the next month, with the ultimate aim being to
turn Eotienses in to a high tech hub that will be the envy of the entire
Empire.\
\
In order to help facilitate the rejuvenation effort, Senator Patreus has
placed a series of order which require several millions units of
Industrial Materials be brought to his agents on Parkinson Dock. All
citizens that take part in the rejuvenation programme will be well
rewarded for their efforts.
