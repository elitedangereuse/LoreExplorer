The Vadimo Patrons of Law, an Imperial organisation based in Vadimo,
have announced plans to host an elaborate soir√©e in the system.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation elaborated on the nature of the
event:\
Let\'s be honest, things aren\'t great at the moment. We\'ve got
aggressive aliens on the doorstep and no one seems entirely sure what to
do about it. So we thought -- why not throw a big party? Give the people
of Vadimo a chance to forget about their worries for a night. We want
this to be the best party the system has ever seen. Or at least the best
one of 3304.\
\
To ensure that the event is a success, the Vadimo Patrons of Law have
placed a kill order on wanted ships operating in the system.
