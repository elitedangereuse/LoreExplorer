Due to heightened military action in the core systems, Senator Caspian
Leopold has launched an initiative to construct a rehabilitation centre
for those affected by the ongoing conflict.\
\
A spokesperson for Senator Leopold gave the following statement to the
media: An escalation in hostilities from both Thargoid and human parties
has left a lot of innocent civilians without food or shelter. Senator
Leopold has heard their cries for help, and is building a sanctuary
where the safety of refugees can be guaranteed. The Niflhel Corp., which
is overseeing the initiative, has placed a kill order on ships on its
wanted list to allow pilots delivering construction materials to do so
safely. They have promised to reward pilots who hand in bounty vouchers
at Biruni Port in the Niflhel system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 14th of June 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Biruni Port in the Niflhel system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
