Rival initiatives to arrange a diplomatic conference have been launched
by Sirius Corporation and the Utopia commune.\
\
The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have each
provisionally agreed to send delegates to the first tri-superpower
Galactic Summit. This political gathering will also be attended by
representatives from independent systems.\
\
All parties have specified that their participation depends upon the
event being successfully organised in neutral territory, and with
sufficient resources and security in place.\
\
Sirius Corporation and Utopia have begun to gather supplies to host the
conference. Both have requested assistance from the galactic community
to provide data for their security services.\
\
Simguru Pranav Antal has called upon all pilots who support Utopia\'s
proposal to deliver Anomalous Bulk Scan Data, Atypical Disrupted Wake
Echoes, Exceptional Scrambled Emission Data and Unusual Encrypted Files
to Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system.\
\
The initiative begins on the 21st of January 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
Should both initiatives be completed to the same tier, the one with the
highest contribution will be designated the victor.
