Recent reports indicate that a number of unauthorised outposts have been
detected in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 System. A spokesperson for the
Colonia Council confirmed that these outposts are currently occupied by
group of agitators, which have already begun targeting pilots in the
system.\
\
The Colonia region is a popular emigration destination, but entry is
carefully controlled by the system\'s governing body, the Colonia
Council. Evidently, the system\'s latest residents are unconcerned with
the Council\'s processes.\
\
With the Colonia community still at an early stage and lacking a
comprehensive security force, it is relying on the galaxy\'s independent
combat pilots for military support. The Junkyard Dogs has placed a kill
order on all wanted ships operating in Colonia, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Tolagarf\'s Junkjard.\
\
The campaign begins on 18th of May 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Tolagarf\'s Junkyard in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215
system. Only bounty vouchers handed in after signing up will count
toward your personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
