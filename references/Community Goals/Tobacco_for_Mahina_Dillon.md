A gambler by the name of Mahina Dillon claims to have made a discovery
of profound importance. Although Dillon has offered a clue to the
location of this discovery, she has said she will only reveal further
information is she is given \"enough tobacco to last a lifetime.\"\
\
Independent pilots are therefore invited to deliver quantities of
Tobacco to McMullen Vision in the Massagetae system. If Dillon\'s
targets are met, she will off the public a second clue.\
\
To take part in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Tobacco to McMullen Vision in the Massagetae system.\
\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA-bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the appeal from running smoothly.\
