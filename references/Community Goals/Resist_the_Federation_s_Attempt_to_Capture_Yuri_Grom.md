The Delta Pavonis political conference has erupted into conflict between
EG Union and Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar.\
\
Yuri Grom, the ruler of EG Union, broadcast this
[message:\\\\](message:\\)\
\"This conference was nothing more than a trap! My delegation was
apprehended at gunpoint by a squad of undercover Federal agents.
Sacrifices made by my loyal guards enabled us to escape from Kessler
City, only to find our ships under attack. The Federation has declared
war -- I will respond in kind!\"\
\
The EG Union called for help from \"allies of Yuri Grom and enemies of
the Federation\".\
\
Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, the host of the political conference, has
rejected claims that his faction was secretly working with the
Federation to entrap Yuri Grom. The Federal Diplomatic Corps has not yet
commented on its role in these events.\
\
To help protect Yuri Grom, combat bonds should be delivered to the
Indomitable megaship in the Delta Pavonis system.\
\
Should EG Union prevail over Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar, the
top 75% will have two fixed-mount Class 2 Seeker Missile Racks with
double-engineered high capacity, increased fire rate and drag munitions,
but increased power draw and mass. These will be placed in storage at
the Indomitable by the 9th of October 3307.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 7th
of October 3307.
