Earlier this month, the Mu Koji system was engulfed in the ongoing
conflict between the Empire and the Federation, as the superpowers
staged rival operations to secure enemy intelligence.\
\
Although the battle only lasted a few days, the collateral damage was
severe, resulting in the displacement of thousands of civilians. System
authorities have responded by establishing a refugee centre at the
Bujold Enterprise starport, but have found themselves unable to provide
the many refugees with medicine and shelter.\
\
The Kalana Independents have therefore offered to fund a coordinated
relief effort. The organisation has placed an open order for basic
medicines and evacuation shelters, and has promised to reward pilots who
deliver these commodities to Bujold Enterprise in the Kalana system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 29th of September 3302 and will run for one
week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
