The Empire and the Federation have announced rival initiatives to
provide a new home for the crew of the generation ship Golconda.​\
​\
During the aid appeal by Upaniklis Vision Incorporated, engineering
experts confirmed that the ancient vessel can no longer meet the
colony\'s needs. While the Golconda was designed for long-term
habitation, it lacks adequate facilities for the current population
levels.​\
​\
After lengthy discussion, the Golconda\'s leaders have reluctantly
decided to abandon the vessel. But the ship\'s captain, Jonathon
Forester, has insisted that its population remain together in one
location.​\
​\
The Federation has taken the approach of offering to create an outpost
where the Golconda\'s spacefaring traditions can continue. This was
outlined by Congressman Harlan Turk:​\
\
\"These people have the inalienable right to continue their current way
of life. A modern outpost will offer vastly superior amenities while
allowing their culture to remain intact, with facilities for new trade
relationships within Federal market guidelines.\"\
\
The Federation has asked the galactic community to support their
campaign. Pilots can deliver polymers, CMM composites, titanium,
beryllium and thallium to the megaship Keller\'s Resolve in the
Upaniklis system​
