The Didiomanja Emperor\'s Grace has completed work on the Tiverion
Academy, a flight school for imperial Naval Cadets. The organisation is
hosting an inaugural banquet to mark the event, and the honour the late
Admiral Mira Tiverion, the organisation\'s founding member, who will
have a monument erected at the site.\
\
The spokesperson for the Didiomanja Emperor\'s Grace released the
following statement:\
\
\"The Tiverion Academy will provide new recruits with cutting-edge
training facilities. To host a fitting banquet for its inauguration, we
require help in sourcing a range of exotic food and drink. We also
require a number of mined commodities to help the monument raised in the
Admiral\'s memory a truly spectacular tribute.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of July 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Gold to Leydenfrost Dock in the Didiomanja System.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensors-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
