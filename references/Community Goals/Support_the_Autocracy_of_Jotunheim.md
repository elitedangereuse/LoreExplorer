Recent reports from Jotunheim indicate that the Autocracy of Jotunheim,
an Imperial-aligned organisation, has entered the system with a remit to
bring it under Imperial control.\
Regional authorities have opposed the incursion, and have authorised the
Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim
from the system. The Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance has also issued
a call to independent combat pilots for support, promising to reward
those who lend their aid. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has issued a
similar plea.\
The campaign begins on the 1st of June 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds at Big Harry\'s Monkey Hangout in the
Jotunheim system.\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your combat
bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These bonds will not count
towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will receive the
reward for their bonds when they are handed in. The proportion of combat
bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their rank.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
