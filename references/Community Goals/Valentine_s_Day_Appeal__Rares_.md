Human civilisation spans hundreds of star systems and encompasses a wide
range of cultures, but many people still share a number of traditions.
One such tradition is Valentine\'s Day, a celebration of romantic love
dating from the 5th Century.\
\
With many choosing to mark the occasion by giving gifts to their
significant other, retailers throughout the galaxy are preparing for a
busy week. One of these retailers, Vestani Conservatives, has placed an
open order for various commodities in anticipation of this hectic
period. A spokesperson for the organisation said:\
\
\"We won\'t be able to fulfil our commercial obligations without the
support of the galactic community, so we\'re offering generous premiums
to pilots who deliver Thrutis Cream, Deuringas Truffles and Esuseku
Caviar to our headquarters at Rose Terminal in the Vestani system.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th of February 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Thrutis Cream, Deuringas Truffles and Esuseku Caviar
to Rose Terminal in the Vestani system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
