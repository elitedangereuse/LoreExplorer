## Warning - Hijacked Data Stream Detected - Malicious Code Injected -

Warning \*\*\
\
The Sons of Conn have reported the presence of a small Federal listening
post hidden somewhere on the surface of Lugh 6. It is believed that the
Federation is using the hidden base as a way to issue secret military
intelligence to Federal forces operating in Lugh space.\
\
This flow of Federal information must be stopped!\
\
Ã‰amonn has issued a call asking for wings loyal to the Crimson State
Group to intercept all convoys as they attempt to leave the vicinity of
Lugh 6. The Sons of Conn will offer assistance in any attacks, but only
for Commanders who pledge their allegiance to the Crimson State Group
before engaging the convoy.\
\
Any examples of Military Intelligence that are captured during the
course of such interceptions must be safely delivered to undercover
field operatives currently operating behind enemy lines. If enough enemy
intelligence is captured, it should help weaken the Federation\'s grip
on the system.\
\
The intelligence already gathered by Crimson State Group supporters has
helped to fortify the defences aboard Crimson State Group controlled
outposts.\
