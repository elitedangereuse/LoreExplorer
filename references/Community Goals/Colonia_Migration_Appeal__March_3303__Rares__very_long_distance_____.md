The Colonia Council has launched a fourth migration appeal to give the
galaxy\'s minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent
presence in the Colonia Nebula.\
\
This month, the Council has targeted the following systems for
colonisation:\
•EOL PROU LW-L C8-142\
•EOL PROU LW-L C8-194\
•EOL PROU LW-L C8-1\
•EOL PROU DK-U B18-4\
•EOL PROU VX-X B16-1\
\
To compete for a migration visa, pilots must sign up with Colonia
Migration Services before delivering quantities of Galactic Travel
Guides to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.\
\
At the end of the appeal, the five factions that have made the largest
contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified
systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for
the organisation\'s sole use.\
\
Be aware that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will be
considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction.\
\
This month\'s campaign begins on the 9th of March 3303 and will run for
four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.\
\
To participate in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Jaques Station in the
Colonia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
