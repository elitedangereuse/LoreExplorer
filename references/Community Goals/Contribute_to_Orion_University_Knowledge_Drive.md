The HIP 43670 system is hosting two competing delivery initiatives, each
of which aims to benefit the Scriveners Clan.\
\
Orion University has partnered with Independent HIP 43670 Labour, which
is requesting deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted
files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670.\
\
The university\'s campaign was explained by Vice Chancellor Leland
Pettigrew:\
\
\"Although Dredger J-403 is legally our property, what we value most is
the Scriveners Clan\'s dedication to deep-space research. To convince
them of our noble intentions, we are donating scientific data and
samples to their Knowledge Core. Our proposal is that they permit us to
accompany them on their journey and share in any future discoveries.\"\
\
Although there remains no response from the Scriveners Clan, the dredger
is now actively monitoring all local and interstellar transmissions.
This is a new development for the isolated community, and suggests they
are aware of these competing efforts.\
\
The first campaign to reach its maximum tier will successfully make its
case. If neither campaign reaches the maximum tier, then the one with
the highest proportional tier completion will be considered victorious.\
\
The dual initiatives begin on the 18th of November 3307 and will run for
one week. Should the campaign to support Orion University reach the
maximum tier it will end immediately.
