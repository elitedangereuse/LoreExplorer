Sirius Corporation has requested commodities to make a fully engineered
detailed surface scanner commercially available.\
\
The ship module was produced in limited numbers during a terraforming
programme campaign by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306. It was awarded
to pilots who provided data on worlds with ammonia-based atmospheres for
its terraforming programme.\
\
Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation, provided
details:\
\
\"Following a feasibility study, we have determined that this module can
be economically mass produced for general sale. Our fully engineered
detailed surface scanner has twice the probe coverage, allowing planets
and moons to be mapped more efficiently.\"\
\
\"In order to begin production, we require large quantities of CMM
Composites, Muon Imagers and Synthetic Reagents. We will generously
reward pilots who can deliver these to Ashby City in the Luyten\'s Star
system.\"\
\
If the initiative is successful, Sirius Corporation will make the module
available for purchase at all human technology brokers by the 25th of
June 3307.\
\
Each tier reached will further reduce the resources required for
acquiring the module in the first two weeks of availability.\
\
Niobium base requirements 24, reduced by three for each tier above Tier
1.\
Mechanical Components base requirements 28, reduced by four for each
tier above Tier 1.\
Germanium base requirements 22, reduced by three for each tier above
Tier 1.\
Mechanical scrap base requirements 26, reduced by four for each tier
above Tier 1.\
\
If the initiative is successful, Sirius Corporation will gift the module
to the top 75% of contributing pilots. The module will be placed in
storage at the Ashby City starport in the Luyten\'s Star system by the
25th of June 3307.
