Aegis has announced a second military strike on a Thargoid-occupied
system, following the success of Operation Andronicus. The operation
will focus on Electra, where high concentrations of Thargoid vessels
have been reported.\
\
Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis\'s chief military liaison, elaborated on the
nature of the operation:\
\
\"We have two primary objectives: To reduce the number of Thargoid
vessels operating in Electra, and to gather Thargoid material with which
to test and calibrate our anti-Thargoid technologies.\"\
\
Aegis Research has agreed to fund the operation, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver Thargoid Hearts, Thargoid Cyclops Tissue
Samples and Thargoid Basilisk Tissue Samples to Cavaleiri in the Electra
system.\
\
The campaigns begin on the 23rd of November and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Thargoid Hearts, Thargoid Cyclops Tissue Samples and
Thargoid Basilisk Tissue Samples to Cavalieri in the Electra system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
