For many retailers, this Friday is one of the busiest days of the year,
as prices are slashed and consumers compete to take advantage of a range
of one-day offers.\
\
As the fateful day draws near, Tchernobog Free, a retail conglomerate
based in the Tchernobog system, has placed an open order for various
commodities to help it meet demand. The organisation has promised to
reward pilots who deliver domestic appliances, clothing and consumer
technology to its base of operations at Vancouver Ring.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation gave a brief statement to the
media:\
\
"Half of my suppliers have let me down and I\'ve got investors breathing
down my neck. I don\'t care how you do it -- just get me those goods!"\
\
The campaign begins on the 24th of November and will run for one week.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering the requested commodities to Vancouver Ring in the
Tchernobog system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week but if the final target is
met earlier than planned then campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
