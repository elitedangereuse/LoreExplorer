Celebrated chef and culinary scholar Dr Cordelius Swainn has issued an
appeal to the galactic community for rare goods for one of his famous
celebrity soirees.\
\
In a statement, Swainn said:\
\
"I create unique dining experiences for the wealthiest patrons and most
important dignitaries to visit the Lave system. I will be hosting
another of these events in a few weeks for one of my most important
clients, and am therefore seeking rare commodities from across the
galaxy. But it is not only food I require -- I am in need of a wealth of
exotic goods, all of which will contribute to overall ambience."\
\
The appeal is being financed by Dr Swainn\'s corporate partner, Lave
Incorporated, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver the
requested commodities to Lave Station.\
\
Concluding his statement, Swainn said:\
\
\"I will offer highly competitive prices for your goods. The farther
your produce hails from, the better!\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd June 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering rare goods to Lave Station in the Lave system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
