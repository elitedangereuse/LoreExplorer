everyone CONGRATULATIONS To every single commander that took part is the
monumental CG, we have shaped the history of the game yet again, by
becoming the first player faction to own a Megaship, now sit back,
endulge in the millions of tonnes of tea that was delivered, pop
yourself a biscuit, slap the decal on your ship, and relax, as the
Gnosis will be arriving shortly :wink: And a big shout out to everyone
in the Top 10 Commanders, you did fantastic!! especially to
\@iamgingerbear for his insane haulage of over 179,000t towards the CG,
and \@AlexVII for his plentyfull 135,000t\
