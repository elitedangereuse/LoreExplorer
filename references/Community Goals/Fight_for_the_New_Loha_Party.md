A long-standing rivalry between two factions in the Loha system has
erupted into full-scale conflict.\
\
The commencement of hostilities was announced on the Vox Galactica news
service by Karleen Troy, a freelance warzone reporter:\
Relations were already strained when Loha Holdings accused its rivals of
hijacking transport ships and murdering their crews. After the New Loha
Party claimed this was a false flag operation designed to discredit
them, diplomacy was rapidly replaced by weapons fire.\
\
Since neither side has an extensive fleet, both Loha Holdings and the
New Loha Party have appealed for support. I\'ve received word that
they\'re offering substantial rewards to independent combat pilots who
can aid them in this conflict.
