The Pleiades Concordat has requested deliveries to support the Far God
cult in the Panjabell system.\
\
Members of the secretive Thargoid-worshipping sect have gathered in huge
numbers, and are preparing to outfit one or more megaships for religious
purposes.\
\
Although the cult has no official spokespeople, local newsfeeds carried
a brief message from one of its senior members, known only as the First
Herald of the Fifty-Eighth Chapter:\
\
\"The faithful have hidden in the shadows for too long. Now is the time
to reach out and welcome the Far God, with the support of our friends in
the Pleiades Concordat.\"\
\
\"The first megaship, the Testament, will be a missionary vessel to
spread the word to all humankind. If we are blessed enough to obtain
commodities for more megaships, these will be sent on a pilgrimage into
deep space to commune with the Far God.\"\
\
Far God believers are generally accepted to be non-threatening, albeit
controversial due to their reverence of the Thargoids. As the cultists
are routinely targeted by anti-xeno extremists, the Pleiades Concordat
has placed bounties on all wanted ships to protect deliveries.\
\
To help protect the Far God initiative, hand in Bounty Vouchers at Moore
Hub in the Panjabell system.\
\
Should this protection initiative reach the first tier:\
The top 75% will receive the Xeno Ally Reach the Stars decal.\
The top 50% will additionally receive the Xeno Ally Handshake Decal.\
The top 25% will additionally receive the Xeno Ally Triforce Decal.\
\
The initiative begins on the 22nd of July 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
