Equipped with a cluster of drive engines, Jaques Station is noted for
being the galaxy\'s only travelling starport. Owned and operated by a
cyborg known as \'Jaques\', the Orbis station has been roaming the
galaxy for over 40 years, and in that time it has become something of a
cultural icon. Now, after more than four decades of travel, Jaques is
about to embark on his most ambitious expedition yet -- a long-distance
jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point.\
\
In a statement, Jaques explained the thinking behind the venture.\
\
\"Well, I\'ve been wandering the galaxy for over forty years now, and
the truth is that after a while, travel starts to lose its allure.
You\'ve got to remember, I\'ve been alive for several centuries. The
things that used to excite you just sort of...lose their spark. I
thought a long-distance leap might rekindle my enthusiasm.\"\
\
Naturally, moving a starport such a considerable distance requires a
significant amount of fuel, which is why Jaques has turned to celebrated
search-and-rescue organisation the Fuel Rats for help. The Fuel Rats, in
turn, have issued an appeal to their many members and supporters to
contribute fuel to Jaques\'s operation. The Fuel Rats Mischief, which is
coordinating the operation, has promised to generously reward those who
support the operation.\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately\
