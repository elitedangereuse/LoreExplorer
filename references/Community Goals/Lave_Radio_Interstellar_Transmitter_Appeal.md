The Lave Radio Network is launching a campaign for pilots to support
them in their efforts to build a new antenna relay in the neighbouring
system of Diso. While performing scheduled maintenance tests, the
current interstellar transmitter was found to be broken. A spokesperson
for Lave Radio released the following statement:\
\
\"It seems that most of the components have been scavenged by raiders...
or taken home by staff... or something. Nevertheless, we now have an
opportunity to construct a new transmitter and foster relations with the
nearby\" **sigh** \"...Diso system.\"\
\
The Lave Radio Network transmitter system is based on an antiquated but
powerful network of focusing crystals, only found in the Cherbones
system: Cherbones Blood Crystals. These are extremely rare and exotic
mineral, extracted in a highly dangerous mining operation.\
\
Lave Radio are requesting all Commanders bring as many Cherbones Blood
Crystals as possible from Chalker Landing in Cherbones to Lave Station
in the Lave system, in order for the new interstellar relay to be
built.\
\
The campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3302 and will run for one week.
The campaign will finish IMMEDIATELY, if the final tier is achieved
earlier than planned. Pilots who support the operation will be
generously reimbursed.\
