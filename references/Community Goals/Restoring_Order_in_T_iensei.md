Authorities in the T\'iensei system have reported a sharp increase in
the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Autocracy of T\'iensei has placed a kill
order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver bounty vouchers to Dzhanibekov Port.
