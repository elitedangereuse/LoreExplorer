The galactic community has been asked to support an initiative that
could counteract the blight that is devastating crops in hundreds of
systems.​\
With the blight pathogen present across inhabited space, the
Interstellar Association for Agriculture has decided to press ahead with
controlled distribution of a promising new agronomic treatment.​\
\
The IAA\'s Dr Genevieve Kane provided further information:​\
\
\"Ever since the blight was identified, our scientists have been working
alongside Rockforth Corporation research teams to develop an effective
counteragent. We appreciate the full cooperation granted by Rockforth
Corporation representatives in this endeavour. Following essential
contributions by both the Vandermeer Corporation and Neomedical
Industries, we have developed an agronomic treatment that should reverse
the disease\'s effects. The priority is to transport the treatment to
the Diso and Orerve systems, which were among the first to be ravaged by
the blight. If these primary agricultural centres can be made viable
again, we can then proceed to revitalise crop production elsewhere.\"\
\
Agronomic treatment can now be collected from the following markets:​\
\
- Conway City, LTT 4961\
- George Lucas, Leesti\
- Thomson Orbital, Lansbury\
- Cousin Ring, Tjindjin\
- Margulis Station, CD-44 10336\
- Nourse City, Esumindii\
\
Independent traders have been asked to deliver the agronomic treatment
to Shifnalport in the Diso system.​
