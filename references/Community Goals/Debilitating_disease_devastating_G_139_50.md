A terrifying disease is currently working its way through G 139-50. So
far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Filipchenko City.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Filipchenko City, the G 139-50
Elektronics Partners are offering a series of incentives to any pilots
that provide medicines to Filipchenko City market until such time as the
crisis has been averted.
