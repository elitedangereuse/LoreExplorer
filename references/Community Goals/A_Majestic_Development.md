Lavigny\'s Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage
system, has launched a campaign to add three new Majestic-class
Interdictors to the Imperial fleet.\
\
At a press conference, Lucius Lavigny confirmed that the Emperor had
personally authorised the campaign. According to Lavigny, the initiative
is a direct response to the Federation\'s \"ongoing military build-up\".
The admiral closed the conference with the words: \"We must continue to
strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons.\"\
\
Lavigny\'s Legion has placed an open order for
Auto-Fabricators,Thallium, Thermal Cooling Units or CMM Composites for
use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver
the requested material to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The
campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If
the Empire\'s targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
Please be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
