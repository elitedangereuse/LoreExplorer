The Milelbis Independents is pleased to announce that Milelbis 4 has now
entered the third stage of its terraforming process. Technicians working
for Big G Corporation are currently in the process of preparing the
necessary equipment in order to launch the next stage.\
\
Unfortunately due to lack of Robotics, the project has been temporarily
delayed until such time as an adequate supply of Robotics can be
obtained.\
\
In order to get the project back on schedule, the Milelbis Independents
are offering a range of rewards to pilots who help ship Robotics to the
technicians aboard Quick Dock before the project enters stage 3.
