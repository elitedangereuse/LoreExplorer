Scientists based at Newholm Station in the Sothis system have discovered
a new metalloid called Sothis Crystalline Gold.\
\
The material is produced by exposing ordinary gold to gas emitted by the
thermal vents lining the seabeds of Sothis A5 and Sothis A6.\
\
The scientists of Newholm Station are eager to conduct further tests on
this new material, but to do so they will need more gold. To help with
this effort, Federation Unite! is offering a series of incentives to
pilots who deliver Gold to Newholm Station.
