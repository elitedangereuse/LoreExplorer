The Future of Segovan, a Federal organisation based in the Segovan
system, has announced plans to construct a number of new Federal Naval
outposts, starting in Segovan and reaching out into the Pleiades
sector.\
\
The bases will serve as resupply points for Federal vessels, and will
support ongoing Federal operations in the region.\
\
A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said\
\
"This is an ambitious initiative that will only succeed with the support
of the galactic community. We are therefore calling on all
Federation-aligned pilots to deliver Insulating Membrane, Gallium and
Power Generators to our base of operations at Ramsbottom Hub, so we can
start work on the first outpost."\
\
The initiative begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\

\
NOTE: System lockdown has been removed.\
