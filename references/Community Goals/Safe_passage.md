A cure for the Cerberus Plague has been discovered, and the process of
eliminating the disease from the galaxy is now underway. Unfortunately,
however, the medical ships transporting the cure from Hart Station are
coming under attack from Pirates, who see the vessels as easy prey.\
\
The Cerberus Plague remains a significant threat, and it is of the
utmost importance that the antidote reaches the systems blighted y the
disease. The pirates targeting the medical supply ships must be
eliminated if the Cerberus Plague is to be wiped from the galaxy. To
this end, the Union of Bast Liberals is offering a series of incentives
to pilots who destroy these pirates. Interested parties should target
pirates with bounties from the Union of Bast Liberals, and hand in the
bounties at Hart Station in the Bast System.
