Commanders have been asked to collect meta-alloys from Thargoid
barnacles as part of a wider xenological study.\
\
The research project is being orchestrated by Professor Ishmael Palin,
one of the most prominent experts in Thargoid technology:\
\
\"With escalating Thargoid activity in the core systems, it is
increasingly important that we learn as much as possible about this
species. Only through scientific study can we better comprehend their
biomechanical nature and, where possible, enhance our defences against
it.\"\
\
\"The initial phase requires fresh samples of meta-alloys, the unique
material used in the construction of Thargoid vessels. These can be
harvested from barnacles that the Thargoids have seeded on selected
planets.\"\
\
Pilots can deliver meta-alloys to the starport James Sneddon in the
Morten-Marte system. As part of the Federal Reclamation Co\'s support
for this initiative, the station\'s market offers a high price for any
Thargoid tissue samples.\
\
In addition to credit payments for all those delivering meta-alloys,
class 4A, 5A and 6A corrosion resistant cargo racks will be available to
selected contributors. The 5A and 6A versions have been exclusively
manufactured for this project, and are not commercially available at
present.\
\
Professor Palin stated that possessing these cargo racks will be of
great benefit in the project\'s planned second phase, scheduled to occur
in the next few weeks.\
\
The cargo racks will be awarded as follows:\
\
Top 75%: 4A Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack (capacity 16)\
Top 50%: 5A Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack (capacity 32)\
Top 10%: 6A Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack (capacity 64)\
\
The campaign will run until the 12th May 3308. If the final target is
met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
