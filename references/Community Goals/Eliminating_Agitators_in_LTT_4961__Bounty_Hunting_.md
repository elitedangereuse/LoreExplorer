NULL, an independent organisation based in LTT 4961, has announced plans
to build a new base at Greg\'s Legacy, a large asteroid named after one
of the organisation\'s founding members.\
\
The organisation has placed an open order for construction materials in
support of this initiative. It has also placed a kill order on all ships
on its wanted list, as part of an initiative to rid the system of
corruption and crime.\
\
A spokesperson for NULL released the following statement:\
\
"Having secured the necessary funds, we are now in a position to offer
generous rewards to pilots who support this two-pronged initiative. With
the help of the galaxy\'s independent pilots, we hope to both expand the
economic power of LTT 4961 and bring peace to the system."\
\
The operation begins on the 13th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Conway City in the LTT 4961 system. Only Bounty
Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
