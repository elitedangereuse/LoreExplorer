Despite the entirely legal way in which the People\'s Quivira for
Equality Party was recently forced to surrender its assets, the Princess
Lavigny-Duval does not wish to see countless innocents suffer for the
mistakes made by their one-time leaders.\
\
To help assist the Quiviran refugees, Princess Lavigny-Duval has
commissioned the Empire Assembly to provide the refugees with whatever
they need to get back on their feet.\
\
In response, the Empire Assembly is now asking residents of Persephone
to aid the refugees by donating articles of wearable clothing, along
with any appropriate accessories that may go along with the donated
clothing.
