An Alliance spokesperson has announced that a Naval convoy has been
attacked in the Rahu system. The spokesperson also confirmed that
criminals have begun targeting the convoy with the intention of taking
escape pods from the wreckage.\
\
They went on to say:\
\
\"These criminals have just one aim: to abduct Alliance personnel and
sell them into illegal slavery. We cannot allow these vile opportunists
to take our comrades captive. We are therefore asking pilots to recover
escape pods from the wreckage and deliver them to Acharya Station in
Rahu.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 23rd of February 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Escape Pods to Acharya Station in the Rahu system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
