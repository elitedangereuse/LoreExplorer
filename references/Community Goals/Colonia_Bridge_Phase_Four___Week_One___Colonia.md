Deliveries have been requested in the Alcor and Colonia systems to
implement services to the Colonia Bridge starports.\
\
A press release from Brewer Corporation provided the details:\
\
\"The fourth and final phase of our Colonia Bridge project will take
place over the next four weeks. Our goal is to finish constructing the
starports that were recently added to the route between the Colonia and
Alcor systems.\"\
\
\"For the first week, we require deliveries of Coffee, Emergency Power
Cells, Geological Equipment and Liquid Oxygen to Jaques Station in the
Colonia system. If we receive sufficient commodities, we can add
Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics to the starport closest to
the Colonia region.\"\
\
\"Everyone at Brewer Corporation was impressed by the galactic
community\'s dedication to improving the travel corridor to the Colonia
region. For this week\'s initiative, contributing pilots have the
opportunity to be rewarded with a generous number of credits. In
subsequent weeks, we will be offering a variety of additional
rewards.\"\
\
\"Following feedback from our shareholders, we also plan to install
beacons to recognise the major contributors to all phases of the Colonia
Bridge project. The top ten contributors of every past and upcoming
Colonia Bridge initiative will be listed on these beacons to immortalise
the names of these pilots.\"\
\
The Colonia Bridge starports currently offer rearm, refuel and repair
services as well as basic commodity trading. The second, third and
fourth weeks of this phase will focus on adding further services.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to the first starport out from Colonia, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Universal Cartographics\
Tier 2: Vista Genomics\
\
Part one of the four-week campaign begins on the 10th of February 3308
and will run for one week.
