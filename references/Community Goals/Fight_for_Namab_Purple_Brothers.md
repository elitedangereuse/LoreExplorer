A long-standing enmity between two military leaders has escalated into
hostilities in the Drevlyada system. Details were provided by freelance
warzone reporter Karleen Troy:\
\
\"The personal rivalry between General Kendrick of Namab Purple Brothers
and Marshal Cooper of Drevlyada League has lasted for years. Each
frequently accuses the other of incompetence and endangering the people
of Drevlyada.\"\
\
\"This grudge match has now spiralled into a state of open conflict.
Both Kendrick and Cooper have asked the galactic community to provide
support in crushing their opponent\'s forces.\"
