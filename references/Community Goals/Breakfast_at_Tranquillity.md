The people of the Leesti system are not the only ones celebrating this
week. The Guardians of Tranquillity have announced plans to host a food
festival in the Tarach Tor system, prompting criticism from Independent
Leesti for Equality, which is coordinating a similar event in Leesti.
The Guardians of Tranquillity have strenuously denied that the event is
an attempt to upstage Independent Leesti for Equality.\
\
Guardians of Tranquillity spokesperson General Hunter O\'Brien released
the following statement:\
The \'Breakfast at Tranquillity\' food festival will showcase the very
best regional cuisine, together with libations from Tarach Tor\'s many
fine vineyards and breweries. In addition to these delicacies, we are
hoping to be able to offer foods from the Lave sector of space, and have
placed an open order for various rare goods.
