For too long the Falisci Purple Gang have been terrorising the trade
routes between Dongzi and Ngaiawang, hiding behind legal technicalities
to avoid the sting of imperial justice. The Citizens of Tradition say no
more! No longer will we sit idly by while law abiding citizens are
attacked, beaten and robbed.\
\
The Citizens of Tradition will bring Falisci to heel, but the glory
needn\'t be ours alone. Thanks in no small part to the generous support
of Senator Denton Patreus, a range of bonus payments (including the
usual spoils of war) will be made available to all pilots who sign up to
fight on the Empire\'s side.
