The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction, an independent organisation based at
Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system, has issued a request
for exploration data. The request is part of an ongoing initiative to
establish a permanent community in the Colonia Nebula.\
\
A spokesperson for 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 released the following statement:\
"If we\'re going to settle in the Colonia Nebula we need to know more
about it, which is why we\'re currently offering highly competitive
rates for exploration data. After all, pilots will be making the trek
out to Jaques anyway -- might as well make some credits en route."\
\
80 DD-D 774-CE-2 has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration
data to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign
begins on the 25th of August 3302 and will run for four weeks. If the
final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Exploration Data to Jaques Station (80 DD-D 774-CE-2)
in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system.\
\
The campaign is scheduled to run for four weeks, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
