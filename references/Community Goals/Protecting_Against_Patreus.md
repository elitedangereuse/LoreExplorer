Senator Patreus has declared war on the system, for failure to pay
credits we didn\'t even owe.\
\
We knew this day would come, and we have a plan! Even now civilians are
being moved to secure locations, and ships are being scrambled to
intercept enemy fighters before they get any deeper into our airspace.\
\
Trouble is, it\'s not enough. If we don\'t manage to slow Patreus\'s
attack dogs down, we\'ll all be dead or sold off as slaves within a
week.\
\
This is a plea to any sympathetic pilots who may have happened to come
our way. The people of Quivira need your help, Commander! We can\'t pay
much, but we\'ll give everything we\'ve got left if it\'ll just buy us a
few more days to fully secure our stations.
