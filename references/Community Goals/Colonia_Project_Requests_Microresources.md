Scientists in Colonia are investigating the region\'s potential to
support larger populations in the future.\
\
Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is leading the research, published this
statement:\
Over the past few years the region\'s population has expanded
ferociously, so it has become a priority to investigate how Colonia
might support even greater numbers, and what kind of infrastructure
would be required.\
\
This research requires a range of specialised materials, for which
we\'re prepared to pay handsomely. With these, we can evaluate
Colonia\'s true potential.\
\
The campaign is being run by Colonia Co-Operative, one of Colonia\'s
partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver micro-resources
to Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.
