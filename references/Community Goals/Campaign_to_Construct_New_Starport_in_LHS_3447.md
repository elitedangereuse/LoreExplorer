Community Goal: Campaign to Construct New Starport in LHS 3447\
\
25 FEB 3302\
\
LHS 3447 is familiar to many independent pilots, being a popular
starting point for those embarking on careers as traders, bounty hunters
and explorers. But many of these pilots have bemoaned the relative
inaccessibility of the system\'s starports.\
\
The Pilots Federation, in association with LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co, has
announced plans to address the issue by constructing a new Orbis
starport in LHS 3447. According to a spokesperson for the organisation,
the new starport will orbit LHS 3447 B 1 a, making it particularly
valuable to miners exploiting the LHS 3447 AB belt.\
\
\"The Pilots Federation is all about building a better future for the
people who keep the galaxy moving. This new starport will give those
people a valuable new trade and resupply hub, in addition to giving the
system\'s economy a boost.\"\
\
The campaign to construct the starport, which will be named \'Bluford
Orbital\', begins on the 25th of February 3302 and will run for two
weeks. Pilots who want to support the first phase of the campaign are
invited to deliver metals to Worlidge Terminal in LHS 3447.\
