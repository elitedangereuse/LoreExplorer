Data deliveries are required by competing initiatives to increase or
decrease civilian surveillance in the Federation.\
\
President Zachary Hudson has asked the public to contribute to making
the Proactive Detection Bureau more effective:\
\
\"The PDB requires access to lesser-known comms channels where
terrorists and criminals lurk. Supplying it with data from multiple
sources will allow us to root out more potential threats.\"\
\
To counter this campaign, Shadow President Felicia Winters aims to
protect personal communications from being intercepted:\
\
\"My duty is to help citizens preserve their constitutional right to
privacy. If enough data can be gathered for baseline testing, we will
distribute legal technology and techniques to secure against government
intrusion.\"\
\
Both campaigns require deliveries of the following data types: unusual
encrypted files, specialised legacy firmware, exceptional scrambled
emission data and anomalous bulk scan data.\
\
To support Shadow President Winters, pilots should deliver data to Ito
Orbital in the Rhea system.\
\
Should the initiative gain more data than President Hudson\'s campaign,
Shadow President Winters\'s policy will deliver a 50% increase in
stability to the systems she controls or exploits. Hudson\'s failure is
predicted to have negative consequences in systems he controls or
exploits, where system security will be decreased by 25%. These effects
are expected to last for at least one month before settling back toward
existing values.\
\
Additionally, the top 75% of contributors will receive a fully
engineered A-rated Electronic Countermeasure with lightweight and
shielded modifications. This will be placed in storage at Ito Orbital by
the 8th of May 3307.\
\
The initiatives begin on the 29th of April 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaigns
will end immediately.\
Should both initiatives be completed to the same tier, the one with the
highest contribution will be designated the victor.
