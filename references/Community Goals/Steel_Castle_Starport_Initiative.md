Two construction companies have requested materials to convert refinery
outposts into starports, to assist owners of fleet carriers who use
large vessels for tritium refuelling.​\
​\
Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc, stated:​\
\
\"For travellers who find the familiar sight of Coriolis stations
welcoming, here\'s a chance to build up to five more. We ask for
shipments of bauxite, gallite and rutile to be delivered to CQC Holdings
at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system.\"\
\
The number of starports will depend on the amount of materials
delivered. The target systems in order of priority are Fjorgyn, HR 4979,
Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta
Cephei and Ninabin. If successful, upgrading will be done for the start
of October.​
