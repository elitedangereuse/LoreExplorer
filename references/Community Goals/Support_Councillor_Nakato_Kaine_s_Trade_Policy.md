Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine have launched
rival delivery initiatives in Alliance space.\
\
The two leading candidates for Alliance prime minister are attempting to
gather public support, although the actual election will be determined
by votes within the Assembly on the 27th of May.\
\
Every opinion poll suggests that Mahon\'s victory is all but confirmed,
which will grant him a second six-year term. However, the outcomes of
these community drives will directly affect the successful candidate\'s
policies once in office.\
\
Councillor Kaine aims to support local manufacturers in order to boost
trade. She has asked for supplies of copper, micro-controllers and
polymers to be delivered to Brett High in the Tionisla system.\
\
Should Councillor Kaine be the most successful, there will follow a void
opal mining initiative to help stimulate trade. This will increase the
availability of rare goods in Alliance-controlled systems.\
\
This week-long initiative will continue until the top target is reached
or time has run out.
