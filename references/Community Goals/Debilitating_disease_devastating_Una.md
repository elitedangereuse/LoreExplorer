A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Una. So far
the illness has defied all attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of the medical staff aboard Hoard Orbital.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that that
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
to assist medical staff aboard Hoard Orbital, the Una PLC are offering a
series of incentives to any pilots that provide medicines to Hoard
Orbital market until such time as the crisis has been averted.
