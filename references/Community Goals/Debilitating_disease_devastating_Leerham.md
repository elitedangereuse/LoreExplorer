A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Leerham. So
far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Low Enterprise.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Low Enterprise, the Revolutionary Leerham
Progressive Party are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that
provide medicines to Low Enterprise market until such time as the crisis
has been averted.
