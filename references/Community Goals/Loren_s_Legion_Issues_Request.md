Loren\'s Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Prism system, has
placed an open order for Tantalum.\
\
The organisation has a wide range of business interests, and regularly
supplies commercial entities with raw materials and other commodities.
On this occasion it has turned to the galactic community for help
fulfilling its commitments.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation released a statement to the media.\
\
\"We have experienced a huge spike in demand, and our facility at
Hiram\'s Anchorage is already running at full capacity, so to satisfy
our clients we will need the help of the galactic community. Fortunately
we are in a position to offer generous premiums to pilots who deliver
Tantalum to Hiram\'s Anchorage in the Prism system.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of March 3303 and will run for two weeks.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
