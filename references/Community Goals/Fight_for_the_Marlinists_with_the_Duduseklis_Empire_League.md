Conflict between Regulatory State of Ackwada and Duduseklis Empire
League in Ackwada.\
\
The Empire has targeted a Marlinist faction that is suspected of
supporting the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA).\
\
The Duduseklis Empire League broadcast this [message:\\\\](message:\\)\
\"If NMLA members have been recruited from our people, it is certainly
not with our knowledge. The Empire is using a terrorist hunt to justify
persecuting millions of ordinary citizens, whose only crime is to
believe in republican ideals.\"\
\
\"We are countering this unwarranted aggression to ensure these
political refugees escape imprisonment. The stronger our resistance, the
more megaships can flee this system. We desperately need help so we can
transport thousands of innocent families to safety.\"\
\
The resistance will begin on the 8th of October 3306.\
\
The initial two phases will be preparation, after which the bulk of the
refugees will be able to leave using four megaships, followed by
additional waves of three.
