The latest reports from the Explorer\'s Association mention that
construction is underway on their newest Ocellus Exploration Station and
they are looking to move into the second stage of construction relating
to the stations internal systems.\
The Explorers Association and Universal Cartographics are once again
teaming up to offer high premiums at Neville Horizons in Kaushpoos on
Palladium mined from nearby systems.\
A spokesperson for the Explorers Association has gone on record as
saying: \"Our contacts at Brewer Corp, the contractor that won the
contract to build the new station have said that the more Palladium that
can be sourced the better the systems that can be installed in the
station. The Explorers Association would like to make this new station a
shining example of what is possible with the latest technologies so we
are looking to all pilots to help deliver as much Palladium as possible
to Neville Horizons.\"\
Sign up as an official supplier and bring as much Palladium as you can
to ensure the new station systems are top of the line.
