The Kumo Crew syndicate has engaged in open warfare on the pirate
insurrectionists gathered in the HIP 10792 system.\
\
A recent coup attempt led by Arch-Corsair Vidar Trask, formerly one of
the senior members of the Kumo Council, has failed. His forces were
unable to eliminate Delaine and take control of the criminal
organisation.\
\
The rebels\' vessels have concentrated in HIP 10792. Trask is commanding
a coalition of loyalists, independent pirate gangs and as-yet
unidentified mercenaries, collectively calling themselves the Trask
Death Corsairs.\
\
Despite suffering from some visible wounds as a result of the
assassination attempt, Archon Delaine broadcast this
[message:\\\\](message:\\)\
\"Trask has betrayed all of us, and for that I want him crushed! I will
pay well to wipe out every single traitor who fights in his name.\"\
\
The Kumo Council faction will reward all independent pilots supporting
its operation against the Trask Death Corsairs in the HIP 10792 system,
which is being orchestrated from Crimson Exchange.\
\
Should the initiative reach Tier 1, the following paint jobs will be
made available to qualifying contributors:\
\
Top 75% - Viper Mk III Pirate Faction Orange\
Top 50% - Vulture Pirate Faction Purple\
Top 25% - Fer-de-Lance Pirate Faction Red\
\
These rewards are cumulative, and higher contributor bands will receive
the paint jobs from lower bands.\
\
The faction has set out a week-long operation to take control of the
system, which will begin on the 19th of May 3308.
