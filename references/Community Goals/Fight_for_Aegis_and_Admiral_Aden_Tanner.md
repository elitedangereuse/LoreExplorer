The megaship Musashi is commanded by Aegis\'s chief military liaison
Admiral Aden Tanner, who made this announcement:\
\
\"The Hind Mine asteroid base contains proof that Salvation\'s
unlicensed anti-xeno weapon is intentionally designed to provoke the
Thargoids, and therefore endangers us all. As Taurus Mining Ventures
refuses to cooperate, we have no choice but to obtain the evidence by
force.\"\
\
\"This may be our only opportunity to discover Salvation\'s true
ambitions. I urge all independent pilots who have fought alongside Aegis
to help us complete this vital mission.\"\
\
Admiral Aden Tanner has asked pilots to support his efforts by handing
in Combat Bonds at the megaship Musashi in the T Tauri system.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached or early on Thursday the 18th of November 3307.
