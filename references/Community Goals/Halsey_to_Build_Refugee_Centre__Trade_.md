Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has announced plans to establish
a rehabilitation centre for victims of war -- specifically those
affected by the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict. In a statement,
Halsey said:\
\
\"The centre will of course provide victims with food and shelter, but
it will also serve to reunite families and friends, and where necessary
will help those affected by war relocate to new systems.\"\
\
Humanitarian groups were quick to applaud Halsey, who since being
discharged from the Clearwater Clinic in July last year has repeatedly
expressed her commitment to peace.\
\
The campaign has received financial support from the Yum Kamcabi Purple
Life Industry, which has placed an open order for Power Generators,
Tantalum and Polymers for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver
these commodities to Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system will be
generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of February 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Power Generators, Tantalum and Polymers to Dirichlet
Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
