Aegis has announced the third phase of its programme to counter the
Thargoid threat, and is once again turning to the galactic community for
the necessary Thargoid-related materials.\
\
As the campaign began, Aegis\' Head of Research, Professor Alba Tesreau,
released the following statement:\
We are facing a technologically superior enemy, and it is essential that
we redress the balance. But for each new device we develop, we need huge
quantities of Thargoid material so we can calibrate the technology and
ensure its efficacy.\
The initiative has received financial support from the Wyrd Jet Power
Industries, which has pledged to reimburse pilots who deliver Thargoid
Cyclops Tissue Samples, Micro Controllers and Explosives to Vonarburg
Co-operative in the Wyrd system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of October and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Thargoid Cyclops Tissue Samples, Micro Controllers and
Explosives to Vonarburg Co-operative in the Wyrd system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
