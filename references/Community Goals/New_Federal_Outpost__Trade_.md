The Federation has announced plans to construct a new survey outpost in
the HIP 17692 system. Federal sources have confirmed that the outpost is
designed to give the Federation a vantage point, close to the Pleiades,
from which to monitor Thargoid activity.\
\
A Federal spokesperson gave the following statement:\
"To date, Thargoid vessels have been encountered in the Maia system and
around the Pleiades Nebula, so we feel it is important to have a
reconnaissance outpost as close to this region as possible."\
\
The Federation, in coordination with the Pleiades Resource Enterprise,
has placed an open order for Power Generators, Geological Equipment and
Meta-Alloys for use in the campaign, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver these commodities to Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692
system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 6th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Power Generators, Geological Equipment and Meta-Alloys
to Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
