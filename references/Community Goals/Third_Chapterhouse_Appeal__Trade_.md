The Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition\'s ongoing infrastructure
project has now entered its final phase. The aim of the project is to
establish a series of starports along the route to Colonia to make the
20,000 light-year voyage less daunting.\
\
For the third and final starport, the Chapterhouse has placed an open
order for Palladium, Superconductors and Micro Controllers, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Shajn Market
in the Kamadhenu system. System authorities have also pledged to issue
above-average rewards for Chapterhouse-issued bounties, to ensure safe
delivery of goods to the starport.\
\
In a statement, Governor Shelby Ortega said: \"I am continually
astounded by the efforts of the galactic community and their support for
our campaign. On behalf of the Chapterhouse, I thank you.\"\
\
The third and final stage of the campaign begins on the 7th of September
3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than
planned, the campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Palladium, Superconductors and Micro Controllers to
Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
