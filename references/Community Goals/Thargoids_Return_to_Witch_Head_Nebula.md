Thargoid vessels detected in Alliance-controlled systems within the
Witch Head Enclave.\
\
The Thargoids have reappeared in the Witch Head Nebula, and are swarming
in large numbers through the Onoros, Lembass, Haki, Wellington and
Shenve systems.\
\
Sixteen systems within the nebula were colonised last year to form the
Witch Head Enclave, after a successful initiative to locate fresh
barnacle sites. This initially triggered a hostile reaction from the
Thargoids, but their presence was relatively low until now.\
\
Captain Warren Lamar, head of security for the Alliance Expeditionary
Pact, put out an urgent call for assistance:\
\
\"If this Thargoid assault is not repelled, it may spread into a
full-scale invasion throughout the Witch Head Enclave. Neither Aegis nor
the Alliance Defence Force are able to deploy in time, so we ask all
independent combat pilots and anti-xeno squadrons to come to our
defence.\"\
\
The Alliance Expeditionary Pact has confirmed that it will offer
generous rewards to all Commanders who assist with destroying Thargoid
vessels.\
The top 75% of contributors will have Guardian Frame Shift Drive
Boosters unlocked and a size four module put into storage for them at
the Golden Stag by the 24th of October.
