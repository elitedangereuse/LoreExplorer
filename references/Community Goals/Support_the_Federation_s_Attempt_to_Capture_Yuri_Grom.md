The Delta Pavonis political conference has erupted into conflict between
EG Union and Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar.\
\
President Zachary Hudson gave an official statement:\
\
\"Yuri Grom is a traitor and a dangerous threat to Federal security. We
cannot ignore any opportunity to eliminate this ruthless tyrant.\"\
\
Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar has asked for Federal auxiliaries to
provide combat support to its forces.\
\
Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, the host of the political conference, has
rejected claims that his faction was secretly working with the
Federation to entrap Yuri Grom. The Federal Diplomatic Corps has not yet
commented on its role in these events.\
\
To support President Hudson\'s actions, combat bonds should be delivered
to the Freedom\'s Foundation megaship in the Delta Pavonis system.\
\
Should Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar prevail over EG Union, the
top 75% will have two fixed-mount Class 2 Rapid Fire Multicannons with
increased damage and phasing sequence, but increased spread and reduced
range. These will be placed in storage at the Freedom\'s Foundation by
the 9th of October 3307.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 7th
of October 3307.
