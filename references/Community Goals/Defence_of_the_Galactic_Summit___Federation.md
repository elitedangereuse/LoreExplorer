The Federation is working with Sirius Corporation to offer bounty
hunting opportunities to protect the diplomatic conference.\
\
The first Galactic Summit has officially opened at Patterson Enterprise
station in the Sirius system. Temporary permits have been issued to all
arriving delegates and Commanders for the three weeks of its term,
although these do not apply to fleet carriers.\
\
Sirius Corporation\'s CEO Li Yong-Rui announced:\
\
\"The data supplied to us in January revealed several unanticipated
threats, putting additional strain on our navy and security forces.
Working with the generous support of the Federation, we have placed
bounties on all wanted ships to ensure delegates\' safety. Pilots
defending the Sirius system will be rewarded for handing in bounty
vouchers at the Spirit of Laelaps.\"\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 75% of participants will receive a
permanent Sirius system permit and the Viper Mk III Acceleration White
paint job. The top 25% will additionally receive the Viper Mk III
Acceleration Gold paint job. These should be processed and accessible by
the 6th of March 3307.\
\
Thanks to the generosity of the Federation, the top 10 participants will
receive a Federal Assault Ship. The ship will be delivered and stored at
Ashby City starport in the Luyten\'s Star system by the 6th of March
3307.\
\
The joint initiative will run for one week, after which Sirius
Corporation will partner with the Empire to provide for the needs and
security of the conference.\
\
If the final target is met earlier than planned, this phase will end
immediately.
