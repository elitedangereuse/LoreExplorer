Beyond the borders of occupied human space, the vast mysteries of the
universe are waiting to be discovered. The last thousand years of human
history have been shaped by our combined ability to travel through the
stars in search of a better future.\
\
Yet what has humanity done with this precious gift? The same thing
we\'ve always done. We waste it.\
\
Greed and war run rampant throughout the galaxy, and the concept of
freedom has become nothing more than a buzzword spewed by people who
have never known it. The Alliance knows there\'s a better way, but to
prove it we need YOUR help.\
\
That\'s why Purple Power Interstellar, on behalf of the Alliance of
Independent Systems, has begun collecting exploration data for an
exciting new colonisation initiative due to launch later this year.\
\
All explorers in possession of interesting cartographic data relating to
potential colonisation sites outside of the current borders of human
space are invited to participate in this historic endeavour.
