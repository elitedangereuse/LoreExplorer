The Kumo Crew syndicate is requesting deliveries to mass-produce a
recreational drug.\
\
The drug is believed to originate with the Blue Viper Club, a nomadic
clan travelling aboard an ancient dredger that recently appeared near
Kumo City station.\
\
Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, representing the Kumo Council, provided
details to local newsfeed The Pegasi Sentinel:\
\
\"Helix will change lives across the galaxy! Derived from high-quality
organic crops, and with many medicinal and psychological benefits, it is
guaranteed to bring contentment.\"\
\
\"All we need to kick-start manufacture are deliveries of agronomic
treatment, liquid oxygen and performance enhancers to Kumo City in the
Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system.\"\
\
Many authorities have registered concern that this will exacerbate drug
addiction and misuse, which are common social problems. However, some
markets have shown interest in the potential new product.\
\
Vox Galactica has reported rumours that it may be a previously unknown
strain of onionhead, a highly popular psychedelic. It remains unknown
whether the Blue Viper Club cultivated it aboard their dredger or
acquired it from another source.\
\
Each completed tier will ensure the effective distribution of resources
and equipment to locally supply the medicinal drug.\
Experts estimate that reaching Tier 1 will enable it to be stocked at up
to 10% of anarchy-controlled industrial markets.\
Tier 2 will extend this to around 20%.\
Tier 3 will extend this to around 30%.\
Tier 4 will extend this to around 40%.\
Tier 5 will extend this to around 50%.\
\
It is expected that if Tier 1 is reached, the product will come to
market around the 22nd of July 3307\
\
The initiative begins on the 8th of July 3307 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, this aspect of the
campaign will end immediately.
