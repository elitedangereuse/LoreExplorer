This far from civilisation establishing a reliable supply line can prove
to be problematic. That\'s why the Explorers\' Association, in
conjunction with Universal Cartographics, are offering to pay premium on
all high quality metals brought to Naddoddur Terminal. Once collected,
the raw materials will be processed for use as key components aboard the
Explorers\' Association\'s newest Ocellus Exploration Station.
