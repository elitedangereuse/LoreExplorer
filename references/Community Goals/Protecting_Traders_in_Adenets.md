The Achilles Corporation has announced plans to replace all robots
destroyed as a result of the recent spy robot scandal.\
\
\
Chairman Gus Weaver of the Sol division of Achilles Corp said:\
\
\
\"We take customer support seriously. That\'s why we\'re offering to
replace -- free of charge -- any robots destroyed or damaged by owners
who suspected them of behaving inappropriately.\"\
\
\
\"To achieve this, we\'ve asked the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond to
organise deliveries of robotics, computer components and
microcontrollers to Henslow Market in the Adenets system. These will be
used to produce brand new PA912 administration robots and other
models.\"\
\
\
The initiative begins on the 29th of November 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
