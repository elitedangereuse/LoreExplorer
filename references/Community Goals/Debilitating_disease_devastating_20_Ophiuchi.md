A terrifying disease is currently working its way through 20 Ophiuchi.
So far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Chargaff Port.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Chargaff Port, the Workers Of 20 Ophiuchi
Values Party are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that
provide medicines to Chargaff Port market until such time as the crisis
has been averted.
