The Pleiades Concordat has requested deliveries to support the Far God
cult in the Panjabell system.\
\
Members of the secretive Thargoid-worshipping sect have gathered in huge
numbers, and are preparing to outfit one or more megaships for religious
purposes.\
\
Although the cult has no official spokespeople, local newsfeeds carried
a brief message from one of its senior members, known only as the First
Herald of the Fifty-Eighth Chapter:\
\
\"The faithful have hidden in the shadows for too long. Now is the time
to reach out and welcome the Far God, with the support of our friends in
the Pleiades Concordat.\"\
\
\"The first megaship, the Testament, will be a missionary vessel to
spread the word to all humankind. If we are blessed enough to obtain
commodities for more megaships, these will be sent on a pilgrimage into
deep space to commune with the Far God.\"\
\
Far God believers are generally accepted to be non-threatening, albeit
controversial due to their reverence of the Thargoids. Some newsfeeds
reported public disgust that the cultists should be active at a time
when Thargoid forces recently attacked several systems.\
\
The Pleiades Concordat has requested that pilots deliver auto
fabricators, emergency power cells and insulating membrane to Moore Hub
in the Panjabell system.\
\
Each completed tier will ensure the outfitting of one megaship that will
commence operation on the 5th of August 3307.\
\
Should this delivery initiative reach the first tier:\
The top 75% will receive the Xeno Ally Reach the Stars decal.\
The top 50% will additionally receive the Xeno Ally Handshake Decal.\
The top 25% will additionally receive the Xeno Ally Triforce Decal.\
\
The initiative begins on the 22nd of July 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
