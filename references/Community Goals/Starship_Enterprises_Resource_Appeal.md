The Starship Enterprises faction has issued a public request for mined
resources.​\
​\
SE Mining, a subdivision of Starship Enterprises, requires materials to
construct a specialised installation in the LP 339-7 system. The
proposed starport will serve as a departmental headquarters while also
providing services to travellers in the region.​\
​\
Dr Lewis Chapman, CEO of Starship Enterprises, announced:​\
\
\"There has long been a rift between our system\'s prosperous inner
worlds and the less wealthy outer gas giants. SE Mining will bridge this
divide with a new asteroid base among the rings of the fourth planet,
which will generate trade to benefit the entire system.\
\
SE Mining has been the backbone of my company since its inception. It
has seen us through hard times and continues to be one of the
corporation\'s most important assets. I believe a new base of operations
is a fine way to reward the division\'s hard work.\"\
\
Independent pilots are asked to mine quantities of osmium, samarium,
uraninite, monazite and platinum for delivery to Gell-Mann Ring in the
LP 339-7 system. ​\
