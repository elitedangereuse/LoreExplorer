Admiral Denton Patreus has announced plans to expand the Imperial Navy
with a new Majestic-Class Interdictor. The formidable vessel will boast
a range of imposing weaponry, including an array of modular interceptor
guns. Lieutenant Severin, who is overseeing the ship\'s construction,
issued a statement to the media:\
\
"I know there are some who would question the need for this vessel. To
those individuals, I say this: just how safe do you feel? We live in an
age in which even Emperors can be murdered. An age in which our
enemies\' faces are not known to us, and betrayal and deceit are
encountered at every turn. The need for a strong, battle-ready navy has
never been greater."\
\
"In order to complete production as swiftly as possible, we have placed
an open order for supplies, and have authorised the Mundjiga Patrons of
Law to reward pilots who deliver materials to our base of operations at
Sagan Port. I implore all those who are loyal to the Empire to support
this operation."\
