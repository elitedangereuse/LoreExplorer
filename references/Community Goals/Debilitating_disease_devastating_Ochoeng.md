A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Ochoeng. So
far the illness has defied all attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of the medical staff aboard Roddenberry Gateway.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that that
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
to assist medical staff aboard Roddenberry Gateway, the Movement For
Ochoeng Revolutionary Party are offering a series of incentives to any
pilots that provide medicines to Roddenberry Gateway market until such
time as the crisis has been averted.
