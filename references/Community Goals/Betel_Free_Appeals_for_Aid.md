Recent reports from the Betel system indicate that an ongoing feud
between the Silver Creative Network and the Betel Free has escalated
into violence.\
\
General Hollis of Betel security issued the following statement:\
After a lengthy period of peace, these factions are now determined to
wipe one another out. As much as we want to subdue this conflict
ourselves, we simply do not have the ships to stage an effective
intervention.\
\
With system security forces stretched thin, both organisations are
seizing the opportunity to settle old grudges, and have issued calls for
support. Pilots who participate in the conflict will be generously
rewarded by their chosen faction.\
\
The Betel Free have set out week-long operations to retain control of
the system which will begin on the 23rd August 3304.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Combat Bonds at Amphipolis in the Betel system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your Combat
Bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These Combat Bonds will
not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of Combat Bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
