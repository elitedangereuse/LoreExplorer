The Secret Billionaires, an organisation based in I Carinae, have
reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in their
system. The organisation has responded with a system-wide operation
designed to remove the agitators and restore order. They have placed a
kill order on all ships on their wanted list, and have promised to
reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Somerset Station.\
\
Secret Billionaires spokesperson Commander Afterglow said:\
\"After one of our CFOs was pirated, the board decided that a cleanup
was long overdue, and they immediately provided credit for an
anti-piracy operation.\"\
\
\"We\'re therefore in a position to offer generous rewards to pilots who
help us clean up the system. With the support of the galactic community,
we should be able to guarantee the safety of our fellow miners and
traders.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of October 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Somerset Station. Only Bounty Vouchers handed in
after signing up will count toward your personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your combat
bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These combat bonds will
not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for these combat bonds when they are handed in. The
proportion of combat bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing, and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
