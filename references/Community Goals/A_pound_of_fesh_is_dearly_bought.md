Those who have explored the trade routes of Wolf 1301 will recall \'wolf
fesh\', a popular psychoactive drug produced in the system. Although
originally legal, when control of the system changed last year the drug
was banned, and production was immediately halted. Wolf fesh disappeared
from galactic trade routes almost overnight.\
\
But now it seems that the drug is about to make a return. Notorious
crime syndicate the Crom Silver Boys, known for targeting traders and
miners from their secret base in the Crom system, claims to have
procured the secret recipe for the drug, and has announced plans to
produce a new variant.\
\
The organisation has already stockpiled the necessary common
ingredients, but to begin production it needs a quantity of rarer
elements found only in other narcotics. The Crom Silver Boys have
therefore placed an open order for the requisite intoxicants, and have
promised to reward those who deliver the following to Walheim Enterprise
in the Herthe system:\
\
Aganippe Rush\
Geawen Dance Dust\
Tarach Spice\
Terra Mater Blood Bores\
Waters of Shintara\
\
Most of the requested commodities are illegal in Herthe, and the
system\'s security forces have vowed to interdict and search any
suspicious vessels. The Crom Silver Boys have advised pilots
participating in the operation to exercise caution.\
\
Jimmy \'Ice Pick\' Falcone, spokeperson for the Crom Silver Boys, was
asked why the operation was not taking place in the Crom system, where
the new drug will be produced. In response, Falcone said:\
\
«Only a trusted few are allowed into Crom. We are giving new pilots a
chance to prove themselves worthy by smuggling illegal goods into
Herthe.»\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th of June 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
