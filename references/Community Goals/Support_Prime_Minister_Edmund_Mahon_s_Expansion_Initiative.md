As the Assembly votes for its new leader, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon
has requested mined tritium to aid expansion.\
\
Prime Minister Mahon\'s new tritium mining initiative aims to provide a
stockpile of fuel to support the Alliance\'s expansion programme. This
will involve constructing up to five new starports, which are expected
to be operational within a month.\
\
Mined deposits of tritium can be delivered to Dublin Citadel in the
Gateway system.\
\
If successful, the top 75% of participants will receive a permanent
system permit for Alioth by the 5th of June 3307.\
\
Each tier reached will mean the construction of a new starport within
Alliance-controlled space, listed in order of priority:\
\
LHS 2522\
Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19\
Bei Dou Sector ZZ-Y b0\
LFT 814\
Herculis Sector IW-W b1-3\
\
This week-long initiative will continue until the top target is reached
or time has run out.
