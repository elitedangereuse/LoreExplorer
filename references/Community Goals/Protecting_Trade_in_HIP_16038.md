Media organisation Broadcast Cobra has announced its intention to build
a megaship in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation, which specialises
in politics and current events, aims to reach a much wider audience with
the construction of this mobile studio.\
Alessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:\
\"As a broadcaster, we like the idea of a ship that can carry our signal
to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. A megaship will allow us to
transmit to systems that other broadcasters can only dream of
reaching.\"\
To facilitate construction of the megaship, Broadcast Cobra has placed a
kill order on all ships on it wanted list, to ensure that those
contributing material can do so safely.\
The campaign begins on the 4th of October 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Sopwith Dock. Only Bounty Vouchers handed in after
signing up will count toward your personal contribution total.\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a proportion of your
combat bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These combat bonds
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for these combat bonds when they are handed in.
The proportion of combat bonds assigned to your crew will depend on
their rank.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
