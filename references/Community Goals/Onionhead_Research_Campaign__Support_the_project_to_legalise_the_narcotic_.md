An organisation known as the Altair Purple Mob has launched a campaign
to prove that the drug is harmless, with the ultimate aim of having it
reclassified as a non-toxic plant. Like the Federation, the organisation
has issued an appeal for quantities of the drug, but unlike the
Federation, the Altair Purple Mob intends to study the plant rather than
destroy it. A spokesperson for the organisation said:\
\
\
"Legalising Onionhead would decriminalise its users, provide the Federal
government with a new revenue stream, and destabilise the criminal
network through which the drug is currently bought and sold. It\'s a
no-brainer."\

No matter which side of the Onionhead debate you\'re on, fly safe out
there, Commanders! o7\
