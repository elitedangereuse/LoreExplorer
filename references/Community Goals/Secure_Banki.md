Things aren\'t looking good. The Federal Navy is trying to fight a war
on two fronts, and right now, it\'s losing. The President has ordered
the Navy to provide more firepower to the Gold Advanced Partners so that
they can oust the rebels once and for all! Unfortunately, it doesn\'t
look like they\'re going to get here fast enough to stop the rebels from
fortifying their position.\
\
That\'s where you come in! Every combat bond you earn on behalf of the
Federation in Banki will help weaken the rebels\' position and increase
the amount of credits the Gold Advanced Partners are permitted to spend
from the federal war chest! Help the people of Banki in their hour of
need, and prevent the deployment of Capital Ships to this sector.
