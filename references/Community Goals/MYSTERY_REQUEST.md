In November last year, a mysterious organisation known as Revolution
Incorporated placed an open order for explosives in commemoration of the
Gunpowder Plot -- a historic incident dating from Earth\'s distant
past.\
\
The request attracted the attention of security officials who feared it
might presage a terrorist attack, but ultimately no such attack took
place. It is now believed that if the group did have nefarious intent,
its plans were foiled.\
\
But despite this apparent setback, the organisation itself has endured,
having issued the following message to media outlets and social networks
throughout the galaxy:\
\
"Last time, they stopped us. This time, they will not. The
powers-that-be must accept their fate, and pay the price for their
misdeeds."\
\
"They will be taught a lesson in power -- the power of the people."\
\
"If you are a true believer, be at the following location at 16.05 UTC
on the 5th of November 3302."\
\
"Novas A 6, Novas system."\
\
Security forces in the Novas system have urged the public to ignore the
message.\

[Notes:\\\\](Notes:\\)

-   Nothing in the CG will require you to be in Open - all modes of play

will be viable.\
- Also, the time stated is just the start, if you can\'t be there then
you won\'t be excluded from anything that follows, you just won\'t be
there at the beginning ...\

is now COMPLETE/FINISHED)\
- \"Unregistered comms beacon\" at NOVAS 6 A started broadcasting a
series of numbers from 16:05 through 16:25 UTC 05 NOV 3302\
...these numbers were a code that lead to a new CG called \"APPEAL FOR
TOXANDJI VIROCIDE (Rare Goods) CG\"
