Security forces in Tanmark have recently found themselves coming under
considerable assault by a larger assortment of villains and thieves.\
\
Exact details as to the nature of the pirates intentions remains
unclear, although sources close to the Defense Force of Tanmark have
indicated that most of the criminals known to be active in Tanmark have
indicated that most of the criminals known to be active in Tanmark are
heavily involved in both drug running and larceny. In order to provide
local security services with the additional manpower they need to combat
pirates operating in the system, the Defense Force of Tanmark are
currently looking to employ a number of bounty to help bolster security
throughout the region.\
\
Any bounty hunter who takes part in the ongoing security initiative will
be eligible for bonus payments from the Defense Force of Tanmark once
the pirates have been defeated.
