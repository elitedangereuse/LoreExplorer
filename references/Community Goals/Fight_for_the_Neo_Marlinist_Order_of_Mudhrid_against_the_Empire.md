Conflict has erupted between the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group and the
Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.\
\
An investigation by ACT in the Mudhrid system confirmed that the Order
of Mudhrid provided logistical support for the NMLA\'s starport attacks.
Their agents infiltrated other local factions to transport enzyme bombs
to their targets.\
\
The faction has now renamed itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.
Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, its leader, has declared a revolution
against the Imperial Family. From his flagship, the Steel Majesty, he
announced:\
\
\"The corrupt Duvals will never give up their power, so we must take it
from them. All those who seek to change the established order -- join
us!\"\
\
The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group responded by engaging their forces in
battle. Senator Denton Patreus has ordered them to \"take revenge for
the \'Nine Martyrs\' atrocities.\"\
\
Landgrave Delacroix has stated that all pilots willing to support the
revolution by handing in Combat Bonds at the Steel Majesty in the
Mudhrid system will be rewarded.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 10% of participants will receive a
uniquely augmented class 2 rating B increased caustic damage and
capacity enzyme missile rack.\
Should the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid be victorious the top 75% of
participants will receive the module.\
The module will be placed in storage at the Steel Majesty in the Mudhrid
system by Friday the 9th of April 3307.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 8th of April 3307. If the final target is met earlier
than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
