Earlier this month the engineer Ram Tah launched his research project to
investigate the ancient ruins in the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system. Since
then hundreds of pilots have answered the call and begun to discover
hidden data about the race that seemingly built the structures.\
\
Now Ram Tah in association with United Meene Labour has issued an appeal
for the following obelisk data types Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and
Epsilon from the site to aid him in locating other sites as part of an
ongoing research project. The organisation has promised to reward pilots
who deliver this data to Felice Dock in the Meene system.\
\
When contacted Ram Tah released this statement:\
\
"The information about the "Guardians" that has been discovered so far
has been very exciting, but this is only the tip of the iceberg so to
speak. All evidence points to the fact that this is not an isolated
site, there are others out there and my research must now move to
finding these locations."\
\
"With the help of other like minded pilots I hope to use the various
data types to unlock the Guardian monolith network and use it to find
other sites."\
\
The campaign begins on the 20th of January 3302 and will run for 2
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon Obelisk Data to
Felice Dock in the Meene system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
