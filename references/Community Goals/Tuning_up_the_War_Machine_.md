As the galactic superpowers seem to be ramping up their respective
militaries, others are looking to bolster their defences. Chancellor
Zahra Arias of the Sovereign Justice Collective has announced plans to
upgrade the infrastructure and defensive viability of Greeboski\'s
Outpost in the Phiagre system. In a statement, Chancellor Arias said:\
\
"Greeboski\'s Outpost is a bastion for the people of Phiagre and a
monument to our independence, and I consider it my duty to upgrade the
starport\'s services. I have therefore placed an open order for titanium
so we can begin the improvement programme."\
