The Explorer\'s Association has issued a public appeal for Exploration
Data. The request has been submitted on behalf of a number of secondary
organizations, which are lined up to purchase the data from the
Explorer\'s Association to improve their planetary databases. Pilots who
wish to contribute to the initiative are encouraged to deliver their
exploration data to Lave Station.
