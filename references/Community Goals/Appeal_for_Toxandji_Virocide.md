A mysterious organisation known as Revolution Incorporated has issued an
appeal for Toxandji Virocide, a rare pesticide.\
\
The chemical is commonly used in industrial-scale agriculture, and can
be \'programmed\' to target specific parasites.\
\
The reason for the request is not clear, but Revolution Incorporated has
promised to generously reward those who deliver the requested commodity
to Wright City in the Elli system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of November 3302 and will run until the
10th of November 3302. If the final target is met earlier than planned,
the campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Toxandji Virocide to Wright City in the Elli system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
