Security operatives in Mu Koji have reported that the Empire and
Federation have launched rival military operations in the system.\
\
Both superpowers have fleets stationed in Mu Koji, and both have
launched attacks against these convoys with the aim of securing valuable
enemy intelligence.\
\
The Xuangu Crimson Major Network has been authorised to coordinate the
Imperial operation, while rival organisation the Mu Koji Resistance is
directing the Federal campaign. Both factions have asked independent
combat pilots for support, promising to reward those who come to their
aid.\
\
The rival operations are scheduled to run for one week from the 8th of
September 3302. If the final target is met earlier than planned the
campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Technical Blueprints to Thuot Market in the Mu Koji
system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Please be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
