Sirius Inc has announced plans to construct a flight-operations megaship
in the 42 n Persei system, which occupies a strategic position on the
route to Maia. The vessel, which will be named the Dionysus, will
dramatically improve services in 42 n Persei.\
\
Senior Aide Humberto Guthrie, speaking on behalf of Sirius Inc, released
the following statement:\
\
"We are disturbed by recent events in the Pleiades and the vulnerability
of our systems. If the superpowers cannot protect us, we will protect
ourselves."\
\
In support of this campaign, Sirius Inc has placed an open order for
various commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these
goods to Green Enterprise in the Ngalia system. The organisation has
also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those delivering commodities to Green Enterprise can do so safely.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of January 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
