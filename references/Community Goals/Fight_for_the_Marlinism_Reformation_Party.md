The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah\'Sine has declared war against
the Marlinism Reformation Party in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.\
\
Political relations degenerated into open combat following the NMLA\'s
recent attacks, with Acting First Minister Amrita Ross\'s efforts to
negotiate a peaceful resolution proving unsuccessful.\
\
Supporters of the Marlinism Reformation Party are gathering at the Steel
Majesty megaship. This was formerly used by the Neo-Marlinist Order of
Mudhrid to flee from their home system.\
\
Minister Aaron Whyte sent this message from his private vessel:\
\
\"Volkov\'s unlawful strike is a violation of our colonies\' charter. We
call upon all true Marlinists to defend us from this illegal act of
aggression.\"\
\
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have informed the Marlinist
Consulate that they consider this conflict to be a strictly internal
matter.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 19th of August 3307. If one faction meets its objectives
earlier than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
