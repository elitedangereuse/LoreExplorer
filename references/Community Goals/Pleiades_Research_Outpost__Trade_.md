The recent revelation that the Thargoids have returned to human space
has sent shockwaves through the galaxy.\
\
Some, such as Federal President Zachary Hudson, have reacted
defensively, promising to protect humanity from what they believe is an
aggressive alien race. More moderate voices have underscored the need
for further information, since so little is known about the Thargoids.\
\
One such voice belongs to the Abroin Universal PLC, which has announced
plans to establish a research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula -- one of
the centres of Thargoid activity.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation said:\
\
"The Thargoids are active principally in the Pleiades Nebula, so we are
eager to establish a research outpost there. As Edmund Mahon said, there
is potentially a great deal we could learn from them. Hopefully this new
outpost will let us do just that."\
\
The Abroin Universal PLC has placed an open order for Lithium,
Semiconductors and Energy Grid Assemblies for use in the construction,
and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to
Campbell Horizons in the Abroin system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 20th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Lithium, Semiconductors and Energy Grid Assemblies to
Campbell Horizons in the Abroin system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
