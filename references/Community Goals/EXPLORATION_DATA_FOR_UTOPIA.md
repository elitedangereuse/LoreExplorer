Every year, thousands of people disappear into the vastness of space.
Some simply venture out too far and lose their way. Others are abducted
by pirates and sold into slavery, their identities irrevocably erased.
Others still may suffer more mysterious fates.\
\
For many, these disappearances are a fact of life - an inescapable
consequence of living amoung the stars. But Pranav Antal, leader of the
technologically progressive enclave Utopia, is unwilling to simply
accept such losses. The simguru, as he is known, has launched a campaign
to gather exploration data with the aim of discovering why so many of
those who traverse the depths of space vanish.\
\
\"The purpose of this campaign is to acquire concrete information about
those disappearances so we can do more to prevent them. But I must
stress that even if we are able to locate missing individuals, it is
likely that they will be too far from our base of operations to make
rescue possible. This is an intelligence-gathering operation only.\"\
\
Utopian representatives have promised to reward pilots who deliver
exploration data to Terry Port in the Garaoku system. The campaign
begins on the 16th of June 3302 and will run for one week.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Exploration Data to Terry Port in the Garoku system.\
