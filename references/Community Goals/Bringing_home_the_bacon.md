To commemorate the anniversary of the so-called \'Bacon Protests\', in
which militant animal rights activists mounted several pro-vegetarianism
rallies , a cooperative of independent pilots known as the Bacon Cats is
organising a celebration at Bacon City in the Carnoeck system.\
\
The events sponsors, United Carnoeck for Equality, have submitted a
request for Animal Meat with which to feed their guests, and have set
aside a quantity of credits for pilots who contribute to this effort.
