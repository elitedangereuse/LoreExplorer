The Alliance is offering bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Didio
system.\
\
Commodore Morag Halloran, who coordinates Salvation\'s military forces,
broadcast this message on public channels:\
\
\"Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to
expunge the latest Thargoid infestation. He estimates two more weeks
before these devices become operational. Until that time, it is vital
that we keep the Thargoids at bay to minimise civilian casualties.\"\
\
The anti-xeno taskforce of the Alliance Defence Force is part of a joint
operation to buy time for the superweapons to be completed. This
includes rewarding independent pilots for defending the Didio system.\
\
Commanders can hand in combat bonds for Thargoid kills until the 12th of
May 3308 at the megaship Plymouth Howl in the Ch\'anjie system.\
\
Jade Sanderlyn, a reporter for Vox Galactica, has been granted
permission to interview the admirals in command of the taskforces. Her
conversation with Admiral Rachel Ziegler is being broadcast by the
flagship Salote Charm in Didio and will be syndicated via newsfeeds.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th April and will run until the 12th May
3308.
