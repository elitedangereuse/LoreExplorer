A development group founded by the Explorer\'s Association has announced
plans to build a new Ocellus starport in the Pleiades Nebula. The first
phase of the project involves collecting the necessary materials to
create the starport superstructure, and to this end the organisers are
offering generous premiums to pilots who deliver metals to Neville
Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.\
\
A spokesperson for the Explorer\'s Association had the following
statement to make: \"We at the Explorer\'s Association, in conjunction
with Brewer Corp. and Universal Cartographics, are proud to be entering
into this ambitious project that when fully constructed will give
explorers a home in the Pleiades Nebula, one of the more colourful areas
of space.\"\
\
To sign up as an official contractor and together we will make it so.
