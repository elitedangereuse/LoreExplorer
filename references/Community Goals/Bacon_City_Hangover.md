The Bacon Protests anniversary celebrations are nearing a close, and it
seems the event has been a resounding success. The only sour note has
been the pirates and other agitators congregating around Bacon City to
prey on the traders and revellers travelling to and from the starport.
United Carnoeck for Equality, the event\'s sponsors, are eager to clear
the spaceways of these disruptive elements, and the faction has set
aside a significant cash fund to reward pilots who eliminate the
troublemakers.
