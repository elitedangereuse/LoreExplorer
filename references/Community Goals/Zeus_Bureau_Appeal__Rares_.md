A press release from the Zeus Bureau, an organisation based in Zeus, has
revealed that the system will soon host a gathering of some of the
galaxy\'s most influential people. Figures from the worlds of politics,
commerce and culture are scheduled to convene at KatherineB for what is
promised to be \"an event of unparalleled opulence\".\
\
With the event scheduled to take place next week, the Zeus Bureau has
placed an open order for a range of luxury goods, promising to reward
those who deliver these commodities to KatherineB in the Zeus system.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:\
\
\"Some of the most powerful people in the galaxy will attend this event,
so it is of the utmost importance that our guests want for nothing. We
have therefore placed open orders for Giant Irukama Snails, Kamitra
Cigars and Lavian Brandy. We are confident that, with the support of the
galactic community, we can create a truly memorable event.\"\
\
The appeal begins on 18th of May 3303 and will run for one week. If the
final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Giant Irukama Snails, Kamitra Cigars or Lavian Brandy
to KatherineB in the Zeus system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
