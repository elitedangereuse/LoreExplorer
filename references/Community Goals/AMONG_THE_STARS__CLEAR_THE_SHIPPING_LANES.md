The Explorer\'s Association has issued a new kill order on wanted pilots
to clear trade routes in an effort to aid independent traders answering
their call for materials to be used in the final phase of construction
of the Ocellus starport in the Kaushpoos system.\
\
\"We are announcing this kill order as we have reason to believe that
pirate groups that disrupted the previous phases in the stations
creation will once again attempt to profit by preying on our trade
pilots.\"\
\"Unfortunately, the times we live in seem to revolve around killing and
piracy for profit at the expense of law abiding pilots. We will do
everything in our power to ensure that pilots have safe passage in
Kaushpoos and surrounding systems.\"\
\
The Explorers\' Association are promising rich rewards to those
independent pilots who eliminate pirate threats to clear the shipping
lanes in and around the Kaushpoos system.
