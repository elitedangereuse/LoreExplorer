Since being discharged from the medical centre at Leoniceno Orbital,
former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has repeatedly spoken about the
allegedly transcendent experiences she had while drifting through
space.\
\
The former leader purports to have seen \"the true architects of
creation\" and to have been shown what she describes as \"the infinities
of the cosmos\" -- assertions that, along with her slowed speech, have
seen her condemned as mentally unstable by some commentators.\
\
Now the former president has launched an appeal for exploration data
that she hopes will validate her claims. According to a member of her
personal staff, the former leader believes the data will prove there are
super-intelligent beings living in the depths of space.\
\
The former Federal president released a brief statement to the media:\
\
\"They are out there. I have seen them. We must put aside our petty
differences and work together to establish contact. There is so much we
could learn from them.\"\
\
The Azaleach Partnership has agreed to coordinate the campaign on
Halsey\'s behalf, and to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to
Leoniceno Orbital. The appeal begins on the 7th of April 3302 and will
run for one week.\
