An Emperor\'s Dawn \'shadow\' cell - a fallback outpost designed to
protect the organisation\'s leadership in the event of a military
defeat - has been discoveredin the Dakshmandi system. Imperial Senator
Denton Patreus has despatched a millitary fleet to Dakshmandi to destroy
what is thought to be the last of the insurgent\'s\' outposts. The
Dakshmandi Focus, on behalf of the senator, has authorized the payment
of privateer bonds to all pilots who drive the Emperor\'s Dawn from
Dakshmandi.\
