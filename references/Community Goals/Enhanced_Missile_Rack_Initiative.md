The engineer Liz Ryder has requested mined materials to help make a
previously unique ship module widely available.\
\
The module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2
Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was offered in October 3306
to pilots who helped defend the Eurybia system from Imperial forces. At
the time, the Empire suspected Liz Ryder of supplying weapons to the
NMLA terrorist group.\
\
Ms Ryder has announced that her aim is to make this specially modified
weapon available for purchase at all human technology brokers.\
\
To support the initiative, shipments of bromellite, lithium hydroxide,
osmium and samarium can be delivered to the Awyra Flirble starport in
the Eurybia system.\
\
Each tier reached will further reduce the resources required for
acquiring the module in the first two weeks of availability, starting on
the 12th of February 3307.\
\
Proto Radiolic Alloys base requirements 16, reduced by two for each tier
above Tier 1.\
Conductive Ceramics base requirements 24, reduced by four for each tier
above Tier 1.\
Hybrid Capacitors base requirements 26, reduced by four for each tier
above Tier 1.\
Phosphorus base requirements 28, reduced by four for each tier above
Tier 1.\
Osmium base requirements 10, reduced by one for each tier above Tier 1.\
\
If the initiative is successful, Liz Ryder will gift the module to the
top 75% of pilots. The module will be placed in storage at the Awyra
Flirble starport in the Eurybia system by the 12th of February 3307.
