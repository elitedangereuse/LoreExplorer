Since it was founded in July 3302, the Colonia community has become a
bastion of peace, seen by many as an island of calm in a sea of
inter-superpower conflict.\
\
But the region is not impervious to occasional outbreaks of violence,
and as Colonia\'s population grows, such outbreaks look likely to become
more frequent.\
\
The latest such incident involves The Nameless, a criminal faction based
in the Carcosa system, which has started attacking ships in Colonia. In
an effort to restore order, the Colonia Council has issued a call to
aid, pledging to reward pilots who help reduce the criminals\' numbers.\
\
The Colonia Council has set out week-long operation to achieve its aims,
which will begin on the 19th of October 3303.
