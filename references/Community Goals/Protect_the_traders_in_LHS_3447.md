The Campaign to construct a new starport in the LHS 3447 system has been
eagerly received by the galactic community, but recent reports indicate
that the traders delivering metals for use in the construction project
are being targeted by marauders. To protect these pilots, the Pilots
Federation, in association with LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co, has placed a
kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system. A spokesperson
for the Pilots Federation issued a brief statement:\
\
\"We will not tolerate any harassment of those who have chosen to
support this campaign. We are therefore offering generous bounties on
all wanted vessels found disturbing the peace in LHS 3447.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3302 and will run for one week.
Pilots who want to help are invited to hand in bounties at Worlidge
Terminal in LHS 3447. If the final target is met earlier than planned,
the campaign will end immediately.\
Pilots who want to help are invited to hand in bounties to Worlidge
Terminal in LHS 3447.\
