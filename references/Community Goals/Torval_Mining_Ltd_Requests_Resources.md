Senator Zemina Torval\'s new corporation requires deliveries of
commodities to its megaship in the EGM 559 system.\
\
Constantia Torval, the senator\'s daughter and operations director of
the company, provided details of the initiative:\
\
\"Now that we are a fully independent business, additional resources are
urgently needed to continue providing services to the Empire. My goal is
to ensure that the Torval name remains synonymous with efficiency and
dedication.\"\
\
\"Shipments of Geological Equipment, Microbial Furnaces and Mineral
Extractors can be delivered to the megaship Pride of Bitterwood in the
EGM 559 system. From there, they will be transferred to our headquarters
at Torval Orbital in LTT 198.\"\
\
Should Tier 1 of this delivery initiative be reached, the top 25% of
contributors will receive a fully engineered class 1 rating D mining
laser with long range. The module will be placed in storage at the Pride
of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system by Friday the 29th of October 3307.\
Should Tier 2 be reached, the top 50% will receive the module.\
Should Tier 3 be reached, the top 75% will receive the module.\
\
For each tier reached, all Torval Mining Ltd megaships will provide a
10% reduction on all available mining modules up to a maximum of 50%.
This discount will start on Friday the 29th of October 3307 and last for
the next four weeks.\
Should Tier 3 be reached, Torval Mining Ltd will deploy technology
brokers to its megaships who will uniquely stock the engineered mining
laser.\
\
The campaign begins on the 21st of October 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
