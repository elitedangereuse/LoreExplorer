Conflict between Regulatory State of Ackwada and Duduseklis Empire
League in Ackwada.\
\
The Empire has targeted a Marlinist faction that is suspected of
supporting the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA).\
\
The Imperial Internal Security Service made this statement:\
\
\"The Duduseklis Empire League is one of several organisations that
publicly accepted the principles of Marlinism. Our intelligence suggests
it is allowing the NMLA to radicalise its citizens into becoming
activists for the paramilitary group.\"\
\
\"Our local representative, the Regulatory State of Ackwada, has
requested the support of independent pilots against any resisting
anarchist forces.\"\
\
The operation will begin on the 8th of October 3306.
