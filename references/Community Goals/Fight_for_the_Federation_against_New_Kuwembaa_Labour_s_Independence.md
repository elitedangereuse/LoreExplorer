The Federation is fighting to prevent further factions from declaring
independence in the Kuwembaa system.\
\
New Kuwembaa Labour has broken ties with the Federation in protest
against the government\'s civil surveillance programme. Li Chotep for
Equality, a local Federal faction, has been tasked to degrade the
rebelling faction\'s military strength.\
President Zachary Hudson made a brief public announcement:\
\
\"I call upon all Federal auxiliaries to aid in this conflict. The
reputation of the Federation will not be so easily tarnished by these
unlawful separatists.\"\
\
Two recently seceded factions -- the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap
Labour -- are considering rejoining the Federation, depending on the
result of the Kuwembaa conflict.\
\
Li Chotep for Equality, in partnership with the Federation, has offered
credit rewards to any pilots willing to help crush this rebellion by
handing in Combat Bonds at the megaship Fortress Liberty in the Kuwembaa
system.\
\
Should Li Chotep for Equality match tiers with New Kuwembaa Labour, it
will remain independent but no other factions will secede from the
Federation.\
Should Li Chotep for Equality end one tier ahead of New Kuwembaa Labour,
it will return to being a Federal faction and no other factions will
secede from the Federation.\
Should Li Chotep for Equality end two tiers ahead of New Kuwembaa
Labour, it will return to being a Federal faction and the Coalition of
Uteran will return to the Federation.\
Should Li Chotep for Equality end three tiers ahead of New Kuwembaa
Labour, it will return to being a Federal faction and the Coalition of
Uteran and Gluscap Labour will return to the Federation.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 12th
of August 3307.
