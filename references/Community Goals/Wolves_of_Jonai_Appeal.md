The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced plans to expand
its presence in HR 7047 by constructing a new asteroid base among the
rings of HR 7047 2 C. But with a lack of reliable supply lines into the
system, the Wolves are relying on the galactic community for help in
amassing the necessary materials.\
\
The Jonai Merchant\'s Guild has been authorised to oversee the appeal,
and has promised to reward pilots who deliver Titanium, Beryllium,
Explosives, Aluminium and Palladium to Grant Dock in the HR 7047 system.
