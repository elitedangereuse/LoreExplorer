The Colonia Council is delighted to offer pilots the opportunity to earn
a migration visa for their chosen faction, and join the rapidly
expanding Colonia Nebula community.\
\
This month, the council has targeted the following systems for
colonisation:\
Eol Prou IW-W e1-1601\
Eol Prou NH-K c9-40\
Eol Prou KW-L c8-164\
Eol Prou IW-W e1-3167\
Eol Prou LW-L c8-227\
Eol Prou PX-T d3-1474\
Eol Prou IW-W e1-2400\
Eol Prou YI-W b17-19\
Eol Prou PX-T d3-336\
Eol Prou IW-W e1-3246\
\
To compete for a migration visa, pilots must sign up with Colonia
Migration Services before delivering quantities of Galactic Travel
Guides to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.\
\
At the end of the appeal, the 10 factions that have made the largest
contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified
systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for
the organisation\'s sole use.\
\
Please be aware that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will
be considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction.\
\
This month\'s campaign begins on the 1st of December 3302 and will run
for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.\
\
To participate in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
