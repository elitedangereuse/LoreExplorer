Smuggle illegal rare liquor into Mansfield Orbiter in Epsilon Indi to
bribe officials in the fight to make Indi Bourbon a legal commodity.\
\
Rumours from the Epsilon Indi system suggest that the United Epsilon
Indi Flag is recruiting independent Commanders for a campaign called
'Bribes 4 Bourbon\'. In a series of illicit meetings with system
officials, the organisation reportedly secured an agreement to revise
the status of Indi Bourbon and make it a legal beverage.\
\
Yulia 'The Needle\' Kuriakova, a spokeswoman for the organisation,
said:\
\
"For almost a year, authorities in Epsilon Indi have prohibited the
production of Indi Bourbon, which is classified as an illegal substance.
Our plan is to bring vast quantities of illegal liquor Mansfield Orbiter
to pay off the officials."\
\
The United Epsilon Indi Flag has requested that Burnham Bile Distillate,
Eranin Pearl Whisky, Leestian Evil Juice, and Wuthielo Ku Froth be
smuggled into Mansfield Orbiter. A temporary black market has been
established to accept these commodities.\
