The Omega Mining Corporation has requested deliveries of raw materials
for a new Orbis starport, to be built in the heart of the galaxy.\
\
To protect those contributing commodities to the initiative, the Omega
Mining Corporation has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted
list.\
\
The initiative begins on the 17th of January 3305 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q
b5-15 system. Only bounty vouchers handed in after signing up will count
toward your personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes and other disruptive events can
negatively impact markets and station services, and could prevent the
initiative from running smoothly.
