Two weeks ago, conflict erupted between the Ant Hill Mob and the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise in the Maia system. But this was no
ordinary inter-factional dispute. According to various sources, the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise was acting under direct orders from
Federation officials eager to bring Maia under Federal control.\
\
With both sides bolstered by Pilots Federation Commanders, the battle
was intense and wide ranging. After several days of conflict it was the
Pleiades Resource Enterprise that emerged victorious, successfully
gaining a foothold in Maia.\
\
But it seems the battle for Maia is far from over. Recent reports
indicate that the Ant Hill Mob is about to launch a retaliatory assault
with the aim of pushing the Pleiades Resource Enterprise out of Maia.
The organisation has issued a call for aid, appealing to independent
combat pilots for support. Pilots who participate in the operation will
be generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of November 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final tier is completed before the end of the week the
conflict will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your combat
bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These combat bonds will
not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for there bonds when they are handed in. The
proportion of combat bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\

(This CG has finished yesterday a new Bounty Hunting CG, \"Conflict

system as this CG -CMDR Peregrinus19)\
