Independent Cherets Labour has issued a request for Anduliga Fireworks
to mark the end of 3301. To ensure the fireworks reach their intended
destination, the organisation has also issued a kill order on all wanted
pilots operating in the system. A spokesperson for the organisation made
a brief statement:\
\
\"We have confirmed intelligence that pirate groups are planning to
disrupt the new year celebrations and plunder incoming traders for
profit. We will not stand for this in our system. Ensuring that the
traders contributing to this initiative remain safe is our highest
priority.\"\
