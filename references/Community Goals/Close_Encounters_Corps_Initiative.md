The Close Encounters Corps has announced its intention to construct a
scientific megaship in the BD-12 1172 system. The new vessel will allow
research teams to map and explore the planets of the surrounding
nebula.\
\
Admiral Anton Vern of the Close Encounters Corps issued the following
statement:\
A number of survey groups have expressed interest in mapping the nebula
surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. This new scientific vessel will act
as a base from which they can research the abundance of unexplored
planets throughout the nebula.\
\
To facilitate construction of the megaship, the Close Encounters Corps
has placed an open order for Muon Imagers and has promised to reward
pilots who deliver these commodities to Crown Prospect in the Kagutsuchi
system.
