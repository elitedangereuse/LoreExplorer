Cobra Wing, an independent organisation based in Ebor, has launched an
initiative to build a new research outpost in the system.\
\
The outpost will support further research into the Thargoids, focusing
specifically on the possibility of inter-species communication.\
\
A spokesperson for Cobra Wing gave the following statement:\
Without communication, there can be no understanding. Without
understanding, there can be no peace. We ask the galactic community to
support this campaign, which will support new research into the
Thargoids and their methods of communication.\
Cobra Wing has placed an open order for aluminium, computer components
and coffee, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these
commodities to Morrison Enterprise in the Ebor system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 12th July 3304 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Aluminium, Computer Components and Coffee to Morris
Enterprise in the Ebor system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
