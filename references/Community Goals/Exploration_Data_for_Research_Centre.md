Dr Roy Casimir of the Holloway Bioscience Institute has announced a
research centre focusing on new life forms discovered by the galactic
community:\
The development of the Codex has led to a number of xenological
discoveries. Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility to
analyse these incredible lifeforms.\
\
We therefore ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which will
form the core of our xenological research catalogue. Nahuaru Crimson
Bridge Int has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse contributing
pilots.
