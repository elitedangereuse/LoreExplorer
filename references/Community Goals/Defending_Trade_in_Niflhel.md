Imperial Senator Caspian Leopold has launched an appeal for commodities
to help those affected by Thargoid attacks.\
\
A spokesperson for Senator Leopold gave the following statement to the
media:\
The recent construction of a rehabilitation centre for those displaced
by the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids has helped hundreds of
thousands of refugees, but more aid is needed. Resources are growing
scarce, and we will require the galactic community\'s help if we are to
avoid a humanitarian crisis.\
\
The Niflhel Guardians Of Tradition, who are overseeing the initiative,
have placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those contributing to the initiative can do so safely.
