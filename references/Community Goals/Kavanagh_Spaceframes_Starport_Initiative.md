Two construction companies have requested materials to convert refinery
outposts into starports, to assist owners of fleet carriers who use
large vessels for tritium refuelling.​\
​\
Susannah Haynes, CEO of Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, stated:​\
\
\"With the galactic community\'s help, we can upgrade a maximum of five
outposts into Orbis starports. Our intermediaries, Tenche Universal
Holdings, will accept deliveries of building fabricators, power
generators and thermal cooling units at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche
system.\"\
\
The number of starports will depend on the amount of materials
delivered. The target systems in order of priority are Fjorgyn, HR 4979,
Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta
Cephei and Ninabin. If successful, upgrading will be done for the start
of October.​
