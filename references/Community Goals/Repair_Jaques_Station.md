Jaques, the owner and operator of Jaques Station, has issued an appeal
for commodities to repair his beleaguered starport.\
\
The station has been in poor shape ever since Jaques made an
unsuccessful attempt to travel to Beagle Point. Since then, a number of
independent pilots have voluntarily delivered meta-alloys to the
station, resulting in the reopening of the starport\'s commodities
market. But to restore the starport to full functionality, a full-scale
campaign is needed. In a statement, Jaques said:\
\
\"We\'re very grateful to all the pilots who brought us meta-alloys over
the past few weeks. But to get the station back online, we\'re also
going to need power generators, tantalum, structural regulators and
energy grid assemblies. So we\'re asking all pilots to deliver whatever
they can.\"\
\
Jaques has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested materials
to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins
on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for four weeks. If Jaques\'s
targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
