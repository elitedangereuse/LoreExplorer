The Empire is offering bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Novas
system.\
\
Commodore Morag Halloran, who coordinates Salvation\'s military forces,
broadcast this message on public channels:\
\
\"Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to
expunge the latest Thargoid infestation. He estimates two more weeks
before these devices become operational. Until that time, it is vital
that we keep the Thargoids at bay to minimise civilian casualties.\"\
\
The anti-xeno taskforce of the Imperial Navy is part of a joint
operation to buy time for the superweapons to be completed. This
includes rewarding independent pilots for defending the Novas system.\
\
Commanders can hand in combat bonds for Thargoid kills until the 12th of
May 3308 at Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.\
\
Jade Sanderlyn, a reporter for Vox Galactica, has been granted
permission to interview the admirals in command of the taskforces. Her
conversation with Admiral Henry Paul Atherton is being broadcast by the
flagship INV Succession in Novas and will be syndicated via newsfeeds.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th April and will run until the 12th May
3308.
