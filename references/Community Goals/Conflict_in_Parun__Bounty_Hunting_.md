A plot to destabilise the Independents of Parun by smuggling quantities
of Personal Weapons, Exposives, and Reactive Armor into Underwood Port
has been uncovered. In response, the Independents of Parun has placed
bounties on all Laksmii Jet Power Industries ships operating in Parun in
the hope of thwarting the operation. The organisation has appealed to
the galactic community for support, promising to reward pilots who
support its campaign.\
\
The operation begins on the 12th of January 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Underwood Port in the Parun system. Only Bounty
Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
