Clauss Incorporated, in association with Santa Muerte Co-operative, has
launched an initiative called \'New Ships for New Commanders\', which
will support new Commanders taking their first steps in their chosen
careers. Nicolas St Clauss, CEO of Clauss Incorporated, explained a
little bit more about the campaign:\
\
\"We need every Commander in the galaxy to help transport Personal Gifts
from Frost Dock in the Njambalba system to us at Clauss Port in the
Santa Muerte system. If our our delivery targets are met, we will use
the proceeds of the sale of these gifts to fund our \'New Ships for New
Commanders\' initiative. We will also be offering generous financial
incentives to all pilots who contribute to the appeal, in addition to
giving out a limited number of brand new ships to new Commanders.\"\*\
\
\*\"Terms and conditions: New ships will only be offered to pilots who
have logged between 3 and 10 hours total flight time. The type of ship
offered will depend on the total number of Personal Gifts brought to
Clauss Port, so please dig deep for your fellow pilots!\"\
\
Note that Frost Dock in Njambalba system is an outpost without large
docking platforms!\
