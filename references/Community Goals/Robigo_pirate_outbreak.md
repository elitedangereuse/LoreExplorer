The Sirius Corporation have issued a system wide kill order to protect
its new mining operations in the Robigo system. In a statement a Sirius
Corporation representative said:\
\"These opportunists are using the expansion of our mining operations to
attempt to get a foothold in the system, We cannot allow this and they
must be stamped out.\"\
\
The Sirius Corporation are offering a significant reward for any
bounties from the elimination of the pirate elements plaguing the
system.
