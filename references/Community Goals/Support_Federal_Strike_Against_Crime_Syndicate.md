The Federation has offered bounties to hunt down all surviving Red
Family ships in the Andowatye system.\
\
Executive Agent Faisal Sacranie of the Federal Intelligence Agency
released this statement:\
\
\"Information provided by the Proactive Detection Bureau revealed that
the notorious Oberon Church has gathered his remaining followers in .
Our mission to take down the narcotics syndicate is not complete until
its kingpin has been arrested and charged for his long list of
crimes.\"\
\
\"The FIA has authorised hiring independent pilots to act as auxiliaries
for this operation. We are working closely with the United Andowatye
Democrats, which has placed bounties on all wanted ships in this
system.\"\
\"It is crucial that our agents locate Oberon Church before he departs
from the system. If we cannot eliminate his defenders in time, he may
once again escape justice and re-establish his drugs empire from the
shadows. We have a duty to all Federal citizens to prevent this from
happening.\"\
\
The has confirmed that contributing pilots can redeem bounty vouchers at
Bosch Station in the Andowatye system.\

The campaign begins on the 14th July 3308 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
