The Kumo Council has declared war on the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group
for the latter\'s role in supporting Neomedical Industries.\
\
The pharmaceutical corporation\'s recent campaign in the Haithis system
enabled the mass production of onionhead gamma strain, scheduled to be
available as a medicinal product from Alliance and independent markets.
The drug is currently distributed in a handful of anarchy systems by the
Kumo Crew syndicate.\
\
CEO Olwyn Kendrick broadcast a call for help:\
\
\"This terrifying attack by the galaxy\'s most vicious pirates may
pressure investors to withdraw, causing the entire project to collapse.
If so, the vital materials that pilots delivered will be wasted. To
prevent this, we urgently require support for our corporate partners
against these criminals.\"\
\
The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group intends to ensure the scheduled
distribution of onionhead gamma strain as a medicinal commodity from
Alliance and independent markets. It has offered rewards to pilots who
help fend off the pirate assault.\
\
Combat bonds can be delivered to Crippen Port in the Haithis system.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 16th
of September 3307.
