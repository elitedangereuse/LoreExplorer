His exalted visionary, Simguru Pranav Antal, has declared that for
Utopia to ascend to true greatness, we must first descend to the lower
worlds so that we may grant the gift of insight to our unenlightened
selves.\
\
Even now, half a million members of the Utopian Project are tolling away
at the Singuru\'s grand design, striving to make manifest the perfect
future for all of mankind.\
\
You may ask yourself, what can I, unenlightened though I am, do to help
make the perfect future manifest? The Simguru\'s answer is simple. Help
supply the Utopian Project with the raw materials of creation, and in
return, you will most certainly share in the abundance that is made
manifest through the Simguru\'s exalted will.
