The Alliance Council of Admirals has announced that an Alliance convoy
has been attacked in the Fedmich system.\
\
A rescue operation has been launched to recover Escape Pods and Wreckage
Components from the wreckage. To ensure the safety of those involved,
the Fedmich Electronics Partners has placed a kill order on all wanted
ships operating in the Fedmich system, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver bounty vouchers to Roberts Port.\
\
The operation begins on the 26th of January 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Roberts Port in the Fedmich
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
