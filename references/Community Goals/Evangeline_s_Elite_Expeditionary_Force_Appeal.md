Evangeline\'s Elite Expeditionary Force has revealed plans to build a
megaship in the Shana Bei system.​\
​\
Archangel Evangeline, commander of the faction, made the following
announcement:​\
\
\"The successful construction of the megaship EFS Archangel will serve
not only the Federation but the entire galactic community. EFS Archangel
will provide a hub for our military operations, allowing us to bring the
fight to our enemies and defend imperilled systems. Together, we will
make EFS Archangel a safe place to trade and share knowledge. Long live
humanity!\"\
\
​\
To ensure completion of the project, the organisation has requested
Superconductors, Computer Components and Insulating Membranes from the
galactic community. Pilots who contribute these resources to the Force
at Chu City in Shana Bei will be rewarded at the conclusion of the
project.​\
​\
The campaign will take place between the 13th and 19th of June 3305. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.​
