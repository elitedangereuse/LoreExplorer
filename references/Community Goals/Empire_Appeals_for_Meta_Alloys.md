As the galaxy becomes increasingly focused on the meta-alloys, the
Empire has issued a galaxy-wide request for the controversial material.
A spokesperson for the Imperial organisation Zagoro Imperial Society,
which is coordinating the appeal, released the following statement:\
\
"We don\'t yet know all the applications of the meta-alloys, but their
ability to counter the harmful effects of the Unknown Artefacts
indicates a potentially significant relationship between them, the
Artefacts and, presumably, the Unknown Probes. It would therefore be
unwise to let anyone to establish a monopoly on this material."\
\
"By supporting this initiative, you can help ensure that humankind is
ideally positioned to meet the future -- whatever it may hold."\
\
It is presumably not immaterial that the Empire\'s initiative coincides
with a Federal campaign to establish a new outpost on the planet HIP
17225 A 1 -- a known barnacle site.\
\
The Zagoro Imperial Society has promised to reward pilots who deliver
meta-alloys to Axon Station in the Zagoro system. The campaign begins on
the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire\'s
targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\

Top tip from CMDR Daniel Cross Reed:\
You can BUY up to 6 Meta Alloys at DarnielÂ´s progress/Maia system with a
bit of a loss. If you need Barnacle locations, write me a message.
Barnacle sites can now be destroyed or intact. Turning the game to menu
and starting it again respawns barnacle spires on harvested barnacles.\
Sell price for M-A at Axon station/Zagoro is 96 963Cr/ton\
Currently bringing only 1 ton of Meta-Alloys shoots to to top 50%
(01-08-2016)\
Scanning the central big barnacle with ROV gives you a nice voucher to
sell at a station contacts list.
