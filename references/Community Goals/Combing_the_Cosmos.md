The Cemiess Empire Party has issued an open contract for Exploration
Data on behalf of the Imperial Internal Security Service. According to
the IISS, the data will be used to locate bases belonging to the
insurgent organization Emperor\'s Dawn.\
\
To help with this effort, the Cemiess Empire Party is offering a series
of incentives to pilots who deliver Exploration Data to Mackenzie Relay
until such time as targets have been met.
