Imperial forces have launched an attack on Volungu. In response the
Crimson Fortune Company have called for federal pilots to gather at
Jemison Refinery to help drive the invaders back!\
\
The fighting is sure to be fierce, but the Volungu Public Company is
willing to pay for any assistance they can get! Allies, bounty hunters
and mercenaries of all stripes are invited to sign up to protect Volungu
from the invaders.\
\
Bonus payments will only be made available if the Volungu Public Company
proves to be successful at fending off their attackers, so independent
contractors are advised to bring along as many friends as possible in
order to ensure the Volungu Public Company survives long enough to see
payment come due.
