The Witch Head Nebula has been confirmed as a primary source of
meta-alloys, following an initiative hosted by Aegis Research. The news
has triggered efforts to swiftly establish a human presence in the
area.​\
\
Aegis Research released this statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:​\
\
\"Having analysed large amounts of exploration data, graciously provided
by the galactic community, we can confirm that the Witch Head Nebula
contains enough barnacle sites to meet the demand for meta-alloys. I am
confident that these sites will offer a suitable alternative to the
exhausted barnacles in the Pleiades Nebula.\"\
\
The Empire has already dispatched advance teams to the region, with the
Liabeze Patron\'s Party coordinating efforts to establish an Imperial
presence in the Witch Head Nebula.​\
\
Pilots seeking to contribute to this initiative should head to Barlowe
Station in the Kaiakul system between the 11th and 22nd of July 3305.​\
​\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before
delivering Palladium, Superconductors and Insulating Membranes to
Barlowe Station in the Kaiakul system.​\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes and other disruptive events can
negatively impact markets and station services, and could prevent the
initiative from running smoothly.​
