The Khaka Future Party have begun preparing Qureshi Entreprise to
receive members of the Federal Nave for the assault on Lugh. As part of
those preparations, the Khaka Future Party are currently looking to
source a large supply of Weapons to help equip conscripts with the gear
they\'ll need to overthrow the rebel forces.\
\
To help establish a temporary supply chain, President Halsey has given
the Khaka Future Party access to a sizeable war chest which will be used
to provide bonus payments to any trader willing to supply the Federation
with weapons during this time of war.
