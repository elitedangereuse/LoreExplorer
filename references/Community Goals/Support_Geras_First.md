Recent reports from the Geras system indicate that after a spate of
reciprocal attacks, hostilities between the Geras First and Ndozins
State Inc have escalated into all-out war.\
\
According to Donal Varden, an independent journalist:\
For several months we\'ve seen these factions sniping at one another
from the shadows, but now the stakes have been raised. It won\'t be long
before the space lanes of Geras are littered with the burned-out shells
of dead ships.\
The warring organisations have issued calls to independent combat pilots
for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be
generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\
\
Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the
system, which will begin on the 1st of November 3304.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Combat Bonds at Yurchikhin Port in the Geras system. Only Combat
Bonds handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your combat
bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These combat bonds will
not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for their bonds when they are handed in. The
proportion of bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
