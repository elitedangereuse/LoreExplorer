It seems that good things just don\'t last long for the People\'s
Quivira for Equality Party. On the tail of their military defeat, a
generous act of goodwill by the supporters of Aisling Duval helped them
back on their feet, and Patreus pardoned them for the failures of their
government.\
\
Unfortunately, limited access to medical care during their flight has
lead to an outbreak of treatable diseases among the populace.\
\
As such, Aisling\'s Angels are calling on all loyal Imperial citizens to
help our brethren in the People\'s Quivira for Equality Party rebuild
their lives. They have suffered enough.\
\
In an effort to encourage the delivery of some much needed Basic
Medicine, the Angels are currently offering a bonus incentive scheme
which is open to all pilots willing to help combat the spread of this
horrific outbreak.
