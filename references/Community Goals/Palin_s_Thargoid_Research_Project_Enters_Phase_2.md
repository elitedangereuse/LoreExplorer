Professor Ishmael Palin has requested deliveries of Thargoid artefacts
to the Arque system for scientific study.\
\
The first phase of the project took place last month and focused on
meta-alloys. In a public announcement, Professor Palin outlined the
second phase:\
\
\"My ongoing analysis of the Thargoids\' biomechanical technology has
reached a point where fresh material is needed. Specifically, I require
large supplies of Thargoid probes, resin and sensors.\"\
\
\"I appreciate that there are risks involved in transporting such
dangerous alien artefacts. Hopefully, the corrosion resistant cargo
racks that were provided following this project\'s initial phase will
prove useful.\"\
\
\"As well as payment in credits, I am pleased to offer Grade 5
Engineered Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Packages as an additional
reward.\"\
\
Rewards will be distributed as follows:\
\
Top 75%: 4D Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Package\
Top 25%: 5D Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Package\
Top 10%: Additional 5D Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Package\
\
Pilots are asked to deliver Thargoid probes, Thargoid resin and Thargoid
sensors to Baird Gateway in the Arque system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th June 3308 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
