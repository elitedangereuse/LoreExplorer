The Alioth Independents have announced plans to host a gala event in the
Alioth system, to officially begin the Alliance presidential election.\
\
The event will give the as-yet unannounced presidential candidates an
opportunity to meet distinguished figures from among the upper echelons
of Alliance society.\
\
Durien Ballas, chairman of the Alioth Independents, issued the following
statement:\
Everyone\'s heard of President Gibson Kincaid, but the other candidates
may not be so well known. This will be their chance to shine. As well as
hosting key members of the Alliance Assembly, we can also confirm that
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and three members of the Council of Admirals
will be in attendance.\
\
To make this a truly spectacular event, the Alioth Independents have
placed an open order for Esuseku Caviar, Ceremonial Heike Tea and Live
Hecate Sea Worms, promising to reward pilots who deliver these
commodities to Smith Landing in the Amber system.
