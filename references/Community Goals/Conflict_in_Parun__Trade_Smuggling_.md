The Laksmil Jet Power Industries has orchestrated an operation to
smuggle quantities of Personal Weapons, Explosives and Reactive Armour
into Underwood Port so Imperial agents can use it to conduct guerrilla
attacks against the Independents of Parun, the system\'s controlling
faction.\
\
The Laksmil Jet Power Industries has appealed to the galactic community
for support, promising to reward pilots who support its campaign by
delivering Personal Weapons, Explosives and Reactive Armour to Underwood
Port in the Parun system.\
\
The operation begins on the 12th of January and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Personal Weapons, Explosives and Reactive Armour to
Underwood Port in the Parun system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
