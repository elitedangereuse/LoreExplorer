It is widely understood that Unknown Artefacts have the ability to
extract materials from their immediate environment as part of a complex
self-repair process. Unfortunately, this can have disastrous effects on
starships and other forms of machinery.\
\
Perhaps the worst affected by this phenomena have been the galaxy\'s
starports, many of which have had to suspend services as a result of
Unknown-Artefact related disruption. The high prices offered for Unknown
Artefacts on the black market means many starports have been flooded
with the mysterious objects. And although meta-alloys can be used to
counter Unknown-Artefact related interference, the scarcity of the
material means this potential salve has had little impact.\
\
But a recent announcement from the Sirius Corporation indicates that the
company intends to tackle the issue by funding a major new research and
development project. The purpose of the project is to make starports and
other outposts more resistant to Unknown-Artefact related interference
through the application of specific microresources.\
\
In support of this programme, the Sirius Corporation has placed an open
order for Unknown Fragments, Untypical Shield Scans and Aberrant Shield
Pattern Analysis, and promised to reward pilots who deliver these
materials to Cormack Hub in the Procyon system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 19th of January 3303 and will run for two
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Unknown Fragments, Untypical Shield Scans and Aberrant
Shield Pattern Analysis to Cormack Hub in the Procyon system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
