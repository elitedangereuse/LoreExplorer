While Halloween is widely thought to have its roots in harvest festivals
from Earth\'s ancient past, in the modern era it is largely seen as an
opportunity to unwind and share a drink with friends.\
\
This year, the galaxy\'s biggest Halloween party is taking place in the
LHS 2094 system under the auspices of the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094.
A range of traditional activities has been planned, including a game
known as apple bobbing, although purists have been quick to point out
that, \"suspending oneself upside down in a vat of Leestian Evil Juice
is most definitely not apple bobbing\".\
\
To ensure the event is a success, the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 has
placed an open order for a range of commodities, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver these goods to Patterson Vision in the LHS
2094 system.\
\
A spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 elaborated on the
nature of the event:\
\
\"There\'s a risk the festivities could be overshadowed by this whole
Thargoid thing, but just because there are hostile aliens in Maia
doesn\'t mean we can\'t have fun. I mean, the Thargoids are all the way
out there...and the party is happening right here!\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 26th of October 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
