The Winged Hussars have announced plans to establish a recreational
installation and a tourist beacon in the HIP 110028 system, next to a
little-visited Earth-like world.\
\
The organisation has said it hopes to attract wealthy tourists from core
systems such as Sol and Achenar -- people who want to relax, but who
also want to experience some adventure.\
\
The Winged Hussars are providing the materials for the new installation,
but to cater to the tastes of their future clients they have asked for
quantities of Lavian Brandy, Eranin Pearl Whisky, Kongga Ale, Leestian
Evil Juice, Indi Bourbon and Bast Snake Gin. Pilots who deliver these
intoxicants to Zander Dock in HIP 110028 system will be handsomely
rewarded.\
\
A spokesperson for the group said: \"This is a great opportunity to
bring new business to one of the galaxy\'s border colonies. We are
asking independent pilots for help, and we are prepared to offer very
competitive prices for the liquors we have requested.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of September 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Lavian Brandy, Eranin Pearl Whisky, Kongga Ale,
Leestian Evil Juice, Indi Bourbon and Bast Snake Gin to Zander Dock in
the HIP 110028 system.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
