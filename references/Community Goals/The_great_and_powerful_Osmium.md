The LHS 2936 Alliance Combine, a manufacturing concern based in the LHS
2936 system, has issued a galaxy wide request for Osmium. According to a
company spokesman, the rare metal will be used to create specialist
alloys with which to improve the organisation\'s manufacturing
facilities. The organisation has promised to reward contributors with
discounts at the Fraser Orbital shipyard in addition to liberal
financial reimbursements. .\
\
Edit: You can mine Osmium in the nearby Parjanya system. The gas giant
BC3 (45.000 ls) contains a metallic ring.\
