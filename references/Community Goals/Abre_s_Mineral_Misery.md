Much needed supplies in Abres are running low. An immediate influx of
Osmium is needed to keep the local operations on track. The lack of the
materials could lead to huge economic downturn, unemployment and civil
unrest.\
\
The Abres Advanced Network have put out an urgent call to all commanders
in the area. They are offering various incentives for all Osmium
delivered to Pangborn Dock.\
\
Help the citizens of Abres avoid chaos, keep the wheels of industry
moving and earn some credits on the side.
