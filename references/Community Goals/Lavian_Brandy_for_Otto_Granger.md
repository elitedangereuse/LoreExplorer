A smuggler by the name of Otto Granger claims to have made a discovery
of profound importance. Although Granger has offered a clue to the
location of this discovery, he has said he will only reveal further
information is he is given enough Lavian Brandy to \"drink himself into
an early grave.\"\
\
Independent pilots are therefore invited to Deliver Lavian Brandy to
Scott Orbital in the Apademak system to receive a second clue from Otto
Granger. If Granger\'s targets are met, he will off the public a second
clue.\
\
To take part in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Lavian Brandy to Scott Orbital in the Apademak system
to receive a second clue from Otto Granger.\
\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA-bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the appeal from running smoothly.\
