Taurus Mining Ventures has requested help with a mining and delivery
operation in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system.\
\
In recent weeks, the mining corporation has performed research on what
it claims are atypical radiation signatures detected within Synuefe CE-R
c21-6. It now seeks shipments of the system\'s native ores to explore
commercially valuable applications of any molecular changes caused by
this radiation.\
\
Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of the company\'s research division, outlined
the initiative:\
\
\"I\'m very excited to offer pilots this opportunity to support our
scientific studies, which will hopefully prove lucrative for all
involved. We require coltan, lithium hydroxide and methanol monohydrate
crystals to be mined from locations within Synuefe CE-R c21-6 and
delivered to the Heart of Taurus megaship.\"\
\
\"We will also pay for shipments of the same ores that have been mined
from other systems. These will allow us to compare samples, in order to
refine our commercial processes.\"\
\
In addition to credit rewards, Taurus Mining Ventures is offering up to
three paintjobs to the top 75% of participants. The number of paintjobs
available will be dependant on the Tier reached.\
\
Tier 1: Type-6 Military Sand\
Tier 2: Type-9 Squadron Shadow\
Tier 3: Python Green Apollo\
\
The faction has set out a seven day campaign, which will end early on
Thursday 7th April 3308.
