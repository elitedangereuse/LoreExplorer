Neomedical Industries has requested deliveries to produce onionhead
gamma strain for Alliance and independent systems.\
\
The new variant of the popular psychedelic drug is currently sold in a
handful of independent systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate. The IHO has
confirmed that the product does have many medical applications.\
\
Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, outlined the initiative:\
\
\"Our goal is to gather sufficient resources for the manufacture of
onionhead gamma strain as a medicinal treatment. Target markets will
include both independent and Alliance systems, should enough commodities
be delivered.\"\
\
\"We request that that pilots transport H.E suits, polymers and robotics
to Crippen Port in the Haithis system. Reimbursements will be arranged
by our corporate partner, Haithis Purple Dynamic Group.\"\
\
Should Tier 1 be reached, Neomedical Industries will have enough
resources to make this medically certified onionhead gamma strain
available at approximately 10% of independent industrial economies.\
At Tier 2, it will extend to 15% of independent industrial economies.\
At Tier 3, it will include 15% of industrial economies in Alliance
systems.\
At Tier 4, it will extend to 20% for both Alliance and independent
industrial economies.\
At Tier 5, it will extend to 25% for both Alliance and independent
industrial economies.\
\
Should everything go smoothly, Neomedical Industries expects to bring
the onionhead gamma strain to market on the 17th of September 3307.\
\
As well as credits, the following rewards are on offer:\
\
The top 75% of contributors will receive the Onionhead 1 decal.\
The top 50% of contributors will also receive the Onionhead 2 decal.\
The top 25% of contributors will also receive the Onionhead 3 decal.\
The top 10% of contributors will also receive the Cobra Mk III Onionhead
skin.\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of September 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
