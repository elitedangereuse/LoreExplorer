The bombs used in recent terrorist attacks on four Imperial starports
may have been developed by Liz Ryder, an Engineer in the Eurybia
system.\
\
The Imperial Internal Security Service published this report:\
\
\"Analysis of station traffic revealed that the explosives were
delivered on cargo transports linked to the Eurybia Blue Mafia, a
notorious anarchist organisation that we have reason to believe is
secretly supplying the NMLA.\"\
\
\"The Eurybia Blue Mafia is protecting the demolitions expert Liz Ryder,
who we strongly suspect of designing the specialist weapons used in the
starport bombings. As they have refused to cooperate, a state of war has
been declared until she is surrendered to our custody.\"\
\
Ana Westergard, a spokesperson for the Eurybia Blue Mafia, broadcast
this emergency [message:\\\\](message:\\)\
\"This is an outrageous invasion by the Empire! We categorically deny
any involvement with the NMLA. I urgently call upon our supporters --
and anyone who cares about freedom -- to help us defend Liz Ryder as
well as our independence.\"\
\
If victorious, supporters ending in the top 75% of contributors will
have a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker
Missile Rack with Thermal Cascade put into storage for them at the Awyra
Flirble starport by the 10th of October 3306.\
\
The two factions have set out week-long campaigns, which will begin on
the 1st of October 3306.
