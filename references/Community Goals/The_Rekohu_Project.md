Angell Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire\'s key suppliers of
foodstuffs and other consumables, has announced plans to build a
Bowman-class science vessel.\
The construction initiative, dubbed the Rekohu Project, will allow the
organisation to increase the biodiversity of its crops. Once complete,
the megaship will be deployed to the PLAA AIN Sector to research life on
Earth-like worlds.\
The organisation\'s spokesperson, Commander Blain Crighton, released the
following statement:\
\"For a civilisation with near-limitless energy and the ability to cross
the stars in the blink of an eye, how is it that we still have systems
experiencing famine? The Rekohu Project is an effort to change that, and
to find new ways to keep even the poorest fed.\"\
In support of this goal, Angell Imperial Enterprises has placed an open
order for various commodities, promising to reward pilots who deliver
these goods to Kanai Enterprise in the Blido Piru system.\
The campaign begins on the 19th of April 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering CMM Composites, Muon Imagers, Titanium and Robotics to
Kanai Enterprise in the Blido Piru system.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
