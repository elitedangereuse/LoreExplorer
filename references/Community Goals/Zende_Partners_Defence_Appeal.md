Following a series of hostile engagements in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96
system, recently established as a hub of Guardian technological
research, both Zende Partners and Segnen Exchange have appealed for
support.​\
​\
Freya Taine, CEO of Zende Partners, made this announcement:​\
\
\"Shortly after our company deployed a megaship transport service
connecting Zende and Guardian space, our convoys came under attack. We
have evidence to suggest that Segnen Exchange is responsible for this
flagrant attempt to undermine our efforts.\
\
I call upon the galactic community to assist Zende Partners in removing
this threat to our operation. Our plans to begin production of an
Advanced Multi-cannon can proceed once Segnen Exchange\'s disruptions
have been dealt with.\"\
\
​\
The two factions have set out campaigns in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, to take
place between the 23rd and 29th of May 3305.​\
