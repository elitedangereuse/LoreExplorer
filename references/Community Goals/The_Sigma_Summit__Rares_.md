Secoya Emperor\'s Grace has been announced as the organiser of this
year\'s Sigma Summit, a three-day conference for some of the Empire\'s
most powerful individuals. Figures from the worlds of finance, politics
and entertainment are expected to attend the event, which this year will
be held in the Secoya system.\
\
The Summit is not without its detractors, with political commentator Sal
Riley recently condemning it as \"a grotesquely opulent and outmoded
display of self-congratulation\". Nevertheless, the number of
influential figures in attendance has prompted suggestions that more
policy making is concluded at the Summit than in the Senate.\
\
As the event approaches, Secoya Emperor\'s Grace has placed an open
order for a range of luxury commodities, promising to reward pilots who
delivering Master Chefs, Kamitra Cigars and Sanuma Decorative Meat to
Joy Port in the Secoya system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 17th of August 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Master Chefs, Kamitra Cigars and Sanuma Decorative
Meat to Joy Port in the Secoya system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
