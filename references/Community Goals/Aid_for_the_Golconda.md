A generation ship with a living population has been discovered in the
Upaniklis system.​\
​\
The ship\'s distress signal was initially picked up by a listening post.
Investigating pilots were surprised to find that the ancient vessel -
identified as the Golconda - had drifted into the uninhabited region
around Upaniklis B.​\
​\
Generation ships are huge, self-sufficient craft from the pre-hyperdrive
era, designed to deliver their original crews\' descendants to
uninhabited systems. Launched in the 22nd century, the Golconda has
survived for more than a millennium as the home of a self-reliant
society.​\
​\
But it is believed the vessel\'s outdated facilities are struggling to
meet the needs of its crew. The inhabitants have reported a lack of
maintenance materials and medical supplies, the latter made more
pertinent by a virus sweeping through the ship.​\
​\
Itsuko Harada of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated gave the following
statement:​\
\
\"These visitors have crossed incredible distances, entirely
disconnected from the rest of humanity until now. Sheer desperation has
forced these proud people to call for help -- a disease referred to as
'the wasting kiss\' is running rampant, and in a closed environment its
effects may prove catastrophic.\
\
Understandably, the Golconda\'s people are reluctant to leave their home
or interact with the rest of the galaxy, at least at present. They have
gratefully accepted our offer of medical supplies and other materials,
however.\"\
\
Traders are asked to deliver basic medicines, advanced medicines,
aluminium, ceramic composites and semiconductors to Fozard Port in the
Upaniklis system.
