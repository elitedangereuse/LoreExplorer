The Federation has announced plans to construct a new survey outpost in
the HIP 17692 system. Federal sources have confirmed that the outpost is
designed to give the Federation a vantage point, close to the Pleiades,
from which to monitor Thargoid activity.\
\
A Federal spokesperson gave the following statement:\
"To date, Thargoid vessels have been encountered in the Maia system and
around the Pleiades Nebula, so we feel it is important to have a
reconnaissance outpost as close to this region as possible."\
\
In support of their trade appeal, The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has
placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those delivering material to Blackmount Orbital can do so safely and has
promised to rewards pilots who hand in Bounty Vouchers at Blackmount
Orbital in the HIP 17692 system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 6th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system. Only
Bounty Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
