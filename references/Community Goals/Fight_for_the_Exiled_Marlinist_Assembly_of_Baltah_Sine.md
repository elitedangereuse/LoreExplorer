The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah\'Sine has declared war against
the Marlinism Reformation Party in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.\
\
Political relations degenerated into open combat following the NMLA\'s
recent attacks, with Acting First Minister Amrita Ross\'s efforts to
negotiate a peaceful resolution proving unsuccessful.\
\
A new megaship, Freedom\'s Voice, has entered service. It is acting as
the operational base for the forces of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of
Baltah\'Sine.\
\
Minister Octavia Volkov announced in parliament:\
\
\"Aaron Whyte and his collaborators are directly responsible for tens of
thousands of deaths. I will not rest until they are defeated and brought
to justice.\"\
\
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have informed the Marlinist
Consulate that they consider this conflict to be a strictly internal
matter.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 19th of August 3307. If one faction meets its objectives
earlier than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
