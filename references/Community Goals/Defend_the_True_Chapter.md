Conflict has erupted in Popontia as the Federation seeks to apprehend
True Chapters cultists of the Far God cult.\
\
The Workers of Popontia Free, which is sympathetic to the sect\'s right
to practise its religion, was outfitting the Dedicant megaship for the
chapter\'s use. Federal ships have been deployed in the Popontia system
with the intention of detaining all cultists and seizing the megaship.\
\
From the Testament megaship, the First Apostle of the True Chapters
delivered a broadcast across public channels:\
\
\"The Dedicant will be a new home for us to await the Far God\'s
arrival. We are prepared to die to defend this holy calling. Our
recognised patrons in the Workers of Popontia Free will fight to protect
us and reward those who aid our cause.\"\
\
These unprecedented hostilities were commented on by Dr Alfred Ulyanov,
an academic authority on the Order of the Far God:\
\
\"This is the first time that members of this faith have not calmly
accepted their own fate. According to my research, the First Apostle
preaches that the Far God will transform her followers upon Its
manifestation, allowing them to survive while the rest of humanity is
extinguished. This has evidently motivated True Chapters adherents to
abandon their wholly passive stance.\"\
\
Both campaigns are being orchestrated by contacts in the system\'s
primary starport, Ryman Market.\
