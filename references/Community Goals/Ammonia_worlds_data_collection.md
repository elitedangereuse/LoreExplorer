Sirius Atmospherics has requested help from independent pilots to
provide data on ammonia worlds for terraforming purposes.\
\
The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is working in partnership with the
Alliance to establish colonies within the Coalsack Nebula, and to
identify sites of commercial and scientific interest.\
\
Dr Maximilian North, Sirius Atmospherics\'s project director, outlined
the requirements:\
\
\"We have developed revolutionary new terraforming procedures for
terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres. Our collaboration
with the Alliance is the perfect opportunity to try and put these to
practical use, with the goal of transforming the region into a more
human-friendly place.\"\
\
\"Sirius Atmospherics offers rewards for explorers who can provide us
with exploration data. We are particularly interested in detailed scans
focusing on the composition of ammonia worlds, not just in the Coalsack
Nebula but elsewhere. Gathering wide-ranging data will enable us to
determine the most suitable targets for environmental conversion.\"\
\
Pilots are requested to deliver their exploration data to the Sirius
Atmospherics research facility at Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark
Region PJ-P b6-1 system.\
\
Although the company is paying handsomely for all exploration data, it
is the data from ammonia worlds that will really progress the research,
with data from mapped ammonia worlds being three times as useful.\
\
Depending on the tier reached, Sirius Atmospherics will offer higher
prices for exploration data starting on the 11th of December 3306.\
Tier 1: Standard payout for exploration.\
Tier 2: One week at double the standard payout.\
Tier 3: One week at three times the payout.\
Tier 4: Two weeks at three times the payout.\
Tier 5: Two weeks at four times the payout.\
\
If successful, the top 75% of contributors will receive a fully
engineered Detailed Surface Scanner with twice the normal probe
coverage.
