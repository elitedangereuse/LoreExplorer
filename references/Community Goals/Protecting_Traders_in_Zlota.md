An obscure cult based in the Zlota system has requested a range of rare
items for an arcane ceremony.\
\
A handwritten statement from Barnabas Cole, leader of a group named the
Children of Tothos, was submitted to the media:\
This is the rite that will unmask us and allow us to see the path -- the
path we will all take, together, toward freedom.\
\
Zlota Federal Holdings, which is thought to have some connection to the
cult, has requested various rare goods to be delivered to
Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system. It has also placed a
kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to protect those delivering
these rare commodities.\
