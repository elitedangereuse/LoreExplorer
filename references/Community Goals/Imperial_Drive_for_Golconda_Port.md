The Empire and the Federation have announced rival initiatives to
provide a new home for the crew of the generation ship Golconda.​\
​\
During the aid appeal by Upaniklis Vision Incorporated, engineering
experts confirmed that the ancient vessel can no longer meet the
colony\'s needs. While the Golconda was designed for long-term
habitation, it lacks adequate facilities for the current population
levels.​\
​\
After lengthy discussion, the Golconda\'s leaders have reluctantly
decided to abandon the vessel. But the ship\'s captain, Jonathon
Forester, has insisted that its population remain together in one
location.​\
​\
The Empire has vowed to help the colonists complete the ship\'s original
mission by establishing a planetside home. Senator Ava Cornelius
summarised the campaign:​\
\
\"After generations in an artificial environment, we want to reward
these travellers with a world to call their own, fulfilling their
destiny after a millennium of adventure. Contemporary agricultural
techniques will enable them to become a self-sustaining colony with full
Imperial support.\"\
\
The Empire has asked the galactic community to support their campaign.
Pilots can deliver polymers, CMM composites, titanium, beryllium and
thallium to the megaship The Lucent Embrace in the Upaniklis system.​
