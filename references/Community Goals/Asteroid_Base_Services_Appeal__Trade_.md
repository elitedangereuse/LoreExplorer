With stage one of NULL\'s plans to build a new base at Greg\'s Legacy, a
large asteroid named after one of the organisation\'s founding members.
They have quickly announced a second stage to equip the station to
provide a wider range of services.\
\
In support of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order
for Superconductors, Computer Components, Power Generators and Tea, and
has promised to once again reward pilots who deliver these goods to
Conway City in LTT 4961.\
\
A spokesperson for NULL released the following statement:\
\
"Having secured the necessary building materials, we are now in a
position to being work on outfitting the station to support a wide range
of services. As with stage one, we will offer generous rewards to pilots
who support this cause. With the help of the galaxy\'s independent
pilots, we hope to expand the economic power of LTT 4961 and make it a
popular destination for all manner of independent traders."\
\
The operation begins on the 14th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Superconductors, Computer Components, Power Generators
and Tea to Conway City in the LTT 4961 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
