With the successful conclusion of the Distant Worlds Expedition looming,
intrepid explorers both within and without the bubble are turning to the
bubbly, and O\'Malligan\'s Coffee Bar at Skvortsov Orbital has announced
plans to throw a party for the returning travellers. A spokesperson for
the establishment said:\
\
\"What does an explorer want after they\'ve returned to the bubble,
stumbled out of their ship and cashed in at Universal Cartographics? A
drink or two! So we\'re throwing the party of the century to celebrate
the achievements of the Distant Worlds pilots, and other intrepid
explorers.\"\
\
O\'Malligan\'s Coffee Bar has approached the Diamond Frogs, the
system\'s controlling faction, for assistance in making the party a
reality. But the Diamond Frogs\' chief logistics officer, Commander
Paramemetic, said: \"There\'s no way O\'Malligan\'s is going to be able
to throw a radical party without support from the Pilots Federation.
Diamond Frogs pilots alone will consume all of O\'Malligan\'s stock
within a matter of hours.\"\
\
To ensure the celebration is worthy of the accomplishments of the
Distant Worlds team, the Diamond Frogs have promised to reward pilots
who bring alcohol and other recreational substances to Skvortsov Orbital
in the 63 G. Capricorni system.\
The campaign begins on the 12th of May 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
