Media organisation Broadcast Cobra has announced its intention to build
a megaship in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation, which specialises
in politics and current events, aims to reach a much wider audience with
the construction of this mobile studio.\
Alessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:\
\"As a broadcaster, we like the idea of a ship that can carry our signal
to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. A megaship will allow us to
transmit to systems that other broadcasters can only dream of
reaching.\"\
To facilitate construction of the megaship, Broadcast Cobra has placed
an open order for thorium, indium and superconductors, and has promised
to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Sopwith Dock in the
HIP 16038 system.\
The campaign begins on the 4th of October 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering thorium, indium and superconductors to Sopwith Dock in
the HIP 16038 system.\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
