Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Duval, has delivered a baby
boy at an undisclosed secure location while under senatorial
protection.\
\
The child has been named Hector Mordanticus Duval. Despite Hadrian not
being an official member of the Imperial Family, many citizens are
jubilant at the arrival of a new Duval.\
\
Nova Paresa has organised an initiative to gather rare commodities for
its former leader to celebrate the historic occasion. Pilots are asked
to deliver Chateau De Aegaeon, HR 7221 Wheat, Indi Bourbon and Yaso
Kondi Leaf to Dyson City in the Paresa system.\
\
To reward contributing pilots, Gutamaya has agreed to an initial 10%
price reduction to all Imperial ships, including the Gu-97 fighter and
fighter bays. A further 5% reduction will be applied per tier reached.\
This price reduction will be available in the Paresa, Cemiess and Cubeo
systems only, and will last for two weeks starting on the 10th of
December 3307. Imperial Navy ranks requirements still apply.\
\
In addition, ship rewards will be provided according to the following:\
The top 10 contributors will receive an Imperial Clipper.\
The top 25% of total contributors will receive an Imperial Courier.\
The top 75% of total contributors will receive an Imperial Eagle.\
\
The ship rewards are rank-free and cumulative. Ships will be placed in
storage at Dyson City in the Paresa system for the 11th of December
3307.\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of December 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
