The Marlinist Colonies have requested assistance to feed their
population.\
\
Eight systems were colonised by the Sirius Corporation to act as
permanent reservations for the political refugees. Millions of
Marlinists have now relocated to these settlements, thereby reducing
tension between the Empire and the Federation.\
\
The newly formed Marlinist factions are holding democratic elections to
select their leaders. However, the transitional parliament has declared
an emergency due to the shortage of food stocks.\
\
Pilots are asked to deliver animal meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and
grain to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.\
\
Each tier reached will increase the level of discount on the purchase
prices of a broad range of commodities sold at Marlinist Colonies
markets.\
This will last for a two-week period starting on the 22nd of January
3307, helping to improve trade links and boost commerce.\
\
The % values are as follows:\
Tier 1 up to 5% reduction\
Tier 2 up to 10% reduction\
Tier 3 up to 15% reduction\
Tier 4 up to 20% reduction\
Tier 5 up to 30% reduction\
\
If successful, the Free Marlinists of Carinae in conjunction with other
Marlinist factions will give the top 75% of pilots a fully engineered,
focused and lightweight point defence module.\
The module will be placed in storage at Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550
system by the 23rd of January 3307.
