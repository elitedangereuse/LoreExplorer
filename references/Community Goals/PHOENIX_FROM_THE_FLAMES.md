The Morrina system has had a rough time of late, with repeated civil
wars and rampant criminal activity bringing the system to its knees.\
\
Now that the dust is beginning to settle, the Spinward Marches Alliance
Concern is stepping in to rebuild the system. The organisation has
launched an appeal for Basic Medicines, Water Purifiers and Power
Generators to help those affected by recent conflicts.\
\
Organisation spokespersons Commander Saool and Commander Dennehy made
the following statement:\
\
In response to this, the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has launched
an appeal for essential supplies in order to undo the damage caused by
the extended conflict. The organisation has placed an open order for
basic medicines, water purifiers and power generators, and has promised
to generously reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Beaumont
Dock.\
\
Organisation spokespersons Commander Saool and Commander Dennehy
released the following statement:\
\
\"For the past month, the Morrina system has been embroiled in conflict
and criminality. The galactic community stepped up to help cull the
criminal elements ravaging the system, and the Spinward Marches Alliance
Concern has started to repair planetary infrastructure and restore power
to the night side of tidally locked Morrina 3. But we need more supplies
to get the system back on its feet.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of April 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
