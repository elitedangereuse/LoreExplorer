Zende Partners has called for increased deliveries of Guardian
commodities in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, the newly established hub for
Guardian-human technological research.\
\
CEO Freya Taine made the following announcement:\
\
"My company has established a scientific research outpost in Guardian
space named The Prospect, which also serves as the termination point for
our megaship transport service from the Zende system. The next step is
to procure a licence that will allow a technology broker to trade from
The Prospect."\
\
"In preparation for this, we invite the galactic community to collect
Guardian commodities from nearby ancient ruins and bring them to the
outpost. This will allow us to provide a stock of existing
Guardian-human technology, while also stimulating further studies into
this extinct civilisation."\
\
Deliveries should be made to The Prospect in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96
system.\
\
The appeal begins on the 16th of May 3305 and will run for one week. If
the maximum requested total is achieved earlier than planned, Zende
Partners will end the campaign immediately.
