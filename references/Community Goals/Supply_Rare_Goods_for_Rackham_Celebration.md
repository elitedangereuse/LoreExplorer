The entrepreneur Zachary Rackham has asked for deliveries of rare items
to Edmondson High in the Beta Hydri system.\
\
At a press conference on the planet Homeland, Mr Rackham announced:\
\
\"It\'s not every day that a humble businessman like me celebrates
becoming a trillionaire! So I\'m holding a week-long party in the upper
floors of Rackham\'s Spire. To make sure my guests are entertained,
I\'ll need to keep my stocks of Apa Vietti from Upaniklis, Gerasian
Gueuze Beer from Geras, Pantaa Prayer Sticks from George Pantazis,
Uszaian Tree Grubs from Uszaa and Anduliga Fire Works from Anduliga high
throughout the entire week.\"\
\
\"I\'ve also arranged for pilots to receive temporary permits to the
Beta Hydri system, which will last until the 2nd of June. Anything to
make life easier for my trader friends!\"\
\
Mr Rackham faced criticism for hosting a celebration at a time when so
many have died in recent Thargoid attacks. In response, he claimed he
had \"a duty to boost public morale by filling the news with happier
stories\".\
\
Financial reporter Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:\
\
\"The guest list for this party includes politicians, media magnates,
publicity gurus, and many others who would prove useful if you were
running a presidential campaign. Should Rackham get enough of them on
his side -- presumably by sparing no expense on their comfort and
entertainment -- I think he\'ll officially set his sights on the
Federation\'s top job.\"\
\
The campaign will run until the 19th May 3308. If the final target is
met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
