The Alliance has announced plans to build an Ocellus starport in the MEL
22 Sector GM-V C2-8 system, to further bridge the gap between the core
systems and the Alliance\'s outposts in the California Nebula.\
\
Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:\
Our previous initiative established a link between our outposts in the
California Nebula and the galactic core. But to ensure the safety and
wellbeing of travellers following the route, we need to maintain a
robust programme of starport construction.\
\
The initiative is being overseen by the Turner Research Group, which has
placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to allow those
delivering materials for the project to do so in safety.
