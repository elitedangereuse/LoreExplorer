The Paladin Consortium has liberated all the imperial slaves at the
starport of Onnes Gateway, but the process of officially terminating the
slaves\' contracts has become entangled in bureaucratic red tape. This
has put the former slaves in a difficult position, as they cannot yet
legally obtain housing or employment.\
In light of this, the Paladin Consortium has issued a galaxy-wide
request for Water Purifiers to ensure the former slaves have access to
basic sanitation while awaiting their \'official\' release. The faction
has promised to reward any pilots who contribute to the initiative.\
