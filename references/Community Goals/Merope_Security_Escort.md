The Atlas Research Group has urgently requested military materials to
increase security in the Merope system.\
\
Defence Director Jacob Chowdhury said:\
The Thargoid presence throughout the Pleiades Nebula continues to be a
major threat. To reassure the public, Atlas is investing in improved
defences for the Merope system.\
\
To help protect incoming ships from criminal elements, we have allocated
bounties to all wanted vessels in the system.
