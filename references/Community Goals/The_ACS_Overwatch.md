The Atlas Corporation has launched a campaign to build a megaship in the
Lambda Arae system.\
\
The vessel, which will be named the ACS Overwatch, will fulfil a
multi-faceted role in the ongoing fight against the Thargoids.\
\
A spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation said:\
The ACS Overwatch will serve as a coordination point for rescue missions
and anti-Thargoid operations, as well as being a valuable resupply point
and a safe haven for the people of Lambda Arae.\
In support of this goal, the Atlas Corporation has placed an open order
for various commodities, promising to reward pilots who deliver the
requested goods to Redi Market in the Lambda Arae system.
