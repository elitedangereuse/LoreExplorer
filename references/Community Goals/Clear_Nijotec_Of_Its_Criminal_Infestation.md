There are very few places in the Galaxy that act as home to a more
villainous band of scum than Nijotec.\
\
For too long the Nijotec Syndicate have been terrorising the innocent
workers of Daley Plant and Porges Refinery, pillaging their transports,
selling their children into slavery and indiscriminately murdering
thousands of people who proved unfit to work in the mineral mines.\
\
Well the Federation says no more. No more will federal Forces stand idly
by as a despicable clutch of rogues operates with impunity so close to
Federal Space. No more will the innocents of Nijotec have to fear those
who wish to do them harm. As such, effective immediately the Federation
is officially declaring war against the Nijotec Syndicate. Any
independent pilots who wish to join the fray should sign up for military
service at the staging area aboard Delbruk Ring in Igorodimos.
