The Alliance has announced plans to construct a new outpost in the
California Nebula and placed an open order for construction materials.
If the campaign is successful, this will be the second Alliance outpost
to be built in the California Nebula in recent months.\
\
An Alliance spokesperson outlined the nature of the initiative:\
\
\"With the Federation and the Empire mired in hostility, it falls to the
Alliance to pursue a more exploratory agenda. This new outpost will
further that agenda by supporting our ongoing research in the California
Nebula.\"\
\
\"The Turner Research Group has generously offered to support this
initiative, allowing us to reward pilots who deliver Geological
Equipment, Micro-Weave Cooling Hoses, Building Fabricators, and Energy
Grid Assemblies to our base of operations at Darwin Research Facility in
the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of May 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Geological Equipment, Micro-Weave Cooling Hoses,
Building Fabricators and Energy Grid Assemblies to Darwin Research
Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
