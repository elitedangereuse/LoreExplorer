The Abroin Universal PLC has placed an order for construction materials
in order to construct a research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula. In
support of this, they have placed a kill order on all ships on its
wanted list, to ensure those delivering materials to Campbell Horizons
in the Abroin system can do so safely, promising to reward pilots who
contribute to the campaign.\
\
The campaign begins on the 20th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Campbell Horizons in the Abroin system. Only
bounty vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
