Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will complete the
six starports along the Colonia Bridge.\
\
Months of work on developing the transportation infrastructure between
the core systems and the Colonia region are now coming to an end. Brewer
Corporation\'s latest press release specified the requirements:\
\
\"Phase four of the Colonia Bridge project has finally reached its
conclusion. Thanks to the many shipments provided by contributors, all
six starports now offer Material Traders, Bartenders and Mission
services.\"\
\
\"For this final week, we are asking pilots to deliver Auto-Fabricators,
Micro Controllers and Resonating Separators to Macdonald Settlement in
the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. These will
allow us to install Pioneer Supplies, Outfitting, Shipyard and Human
Tech Broker services, as we bring the starports to full operational
status.\"\
\
\"Brewer Corporation is grateful to independent pilots for their
dedication to constructing the Colonia Bridge. We are therefore pleased
to offer an Exploration decal to the top 75% of participants who deliver
materials in this concluding stage, as well as a single engineered
overcharged 3A power plant.\"\
\
The top ten contributors for each of the Colonia Bridge initiatives will
have the opportunity to be named in tourist beacons that will
commemorate the project\'s conclusion, and every Commander who has
contributed to any of the Colonia Bridge initiative will receive a
commemorative Brewer Corp decal.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to the first starport out from Colonia, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Pioneer Supplies\
Tier 2: Outfitting\
Tier 3: Shipyard\
Tier 4: Human Tech Broker\
\
Part four of the four-week campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3308 and
will run for one week.
