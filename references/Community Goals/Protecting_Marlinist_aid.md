An aid charity is requesting protection of vital supplies to help
Marlinist refugees that fled from the Empire to the Federation.\
\
Safeguard Interstellar, a humanitarian aid organisation, has announced a
campaign to help refugees requesting political asylum in the
Federation.\
\
Several Imperial factions sympathetic to Marlinism were placed under
martial law, leading to civilians emigrating in huge numbers to the
Federal systems Charunder, Ennead, HIP 36081, LTT 1935, LTT 3607 and
Thetis. Local authorities have warned that without additional support,
these refugees may trigger public unrest or food shortages. There is
also a risk of unfamiliar contagions reaching the population.\
\
Noel Beaumont, the CEO of Safeguard Interstellar, made this statement:\
\
\"These ex-citizens of the Empire have suffered at the hands of their
own government, and now seek freedom from persecution. Shelter, food and
other necessities must be provided to satisfy their basic human
rights.\"\
\
\"We urgently require shipments of basic medicines, clothing, food
cartridges, fruit and vegetables, and evacuation shelters to Fox
Enterprise in the LFT 625 system, from where they will be distributed to
the Marlinists. The more supplies we receive, the more systems can offer
sanctuary without strain on their infrastructure.\"\
\
Safeguard Interstellar\'s intermediary, the Fionn Liberals, has offered
to pay handsomely for all bounty vouchers collected from wanted vessels
in the LFT 625 system.\
\
The initiative begins on the 22nd of October 3306 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met or the aid is delivered earlier than
planned, the campaign will end immediately.
