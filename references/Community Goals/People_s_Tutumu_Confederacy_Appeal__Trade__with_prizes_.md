As the end of the galactic year draws near and people throughout the
galaxy start preparing for their end-of-year celebrations, the People\'s
Tutumu Confederacy has announced a special seasonal event.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement.\
\
\"We have placed an open order for Gold, Pyrophyllite, and Mineral Oil,
and in keeping with the spirit of the season we are offering generous
premiums for these items. Additionally, every pilot who brings us these
goods will be automatically entered into a prize draw, the higher the
percentile reached the more entries that are entered, giving them the
opportunity to win a range of fantastic prizes.\"\
\
\"The more you contribute, the better your chance of winning!\"\
\
The campaign will run from the 1st to the 16th of December 3302.\
\
The prize draw will be carried out by the Galactic Intern on the 19th
December 3302\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Gold, Pyrophyllite or Mineral Oil to North Ring in the
Tutumu system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for two weeks but if the final target is
met earlier than planned then campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
