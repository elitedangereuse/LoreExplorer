The Palin Institute has announced an accelerated programme of study to
analyse a range of xenobiological data, and perhaps discern the motives
behind the Thargoids\' unrelenting aggression.\
\
Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, released the
following statement:\
In recent months, the Institute has performed countless studies on alien
technology and physiology, and our stock of xenobiological samples is
severely depleted. For this robust new study, we require a large amount
of Thargoid material to support a wide range of experiments.\
\
The Ryder Revolutionary Party, which is supporting the campaign, has
placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those delivering materials to Obsidian Orbital can do so safely.
