The Empire has announced plans to construct a new Riker-Class Prison
Ship in the Veroklist system.\
\
Once complete, the ship will house criminals who accepted a period of
Imperial slavery in lieu of a jail sentence, but who have proved to be
too dangerous or unstable for such corrective punishment.\
\
The Moritasgus Imperial Corporation, which is overseeing the initiative,
has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those
contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.\
\
Moritasgus Imperial Corporation spokesperson Superintendent Arnold
Cochran released the following statement:\
\
"We are pleased the Empire has awarded us this contract, and we look
forward to the first ships arriving with our new guests."\
\
Note: Vaucouleurs Vision is an outpost, no Large Pads available.\
No HazRes in system, FSD Interdictor is required.\
Note: HIP 117831 has HazRes. Switch to smaller ship to hand over the
bounties in Vaucouleurs Vision.
