The Diamond Frogs, a mercenary outfit based on the lawless fringes of
the Capricorni sector, has announced plans to build a new installation
in the 63 G. Capricorni system.\
\
The faction\'s current base of operations has become virtually
uninhabitable, as its power and cooling systems being have been pushed
past their limits.\
\
In support of this goal, the faction has placed an open order for Beer,
Liquor, Coffee, Legal Narcotics, Computer Components, Power Generators
and Superconductors, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these
commodities to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G Capricorni system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 7th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Wine, Beer, Liquor, Coffee, Legal Narcotics, Computer
Components, Power Generators and Superconductors to Skvortsov Orbital in
the 63 G Capricorni system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
