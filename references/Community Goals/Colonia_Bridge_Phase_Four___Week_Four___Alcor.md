Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will complete the
six starports along the Colonia Bridge.\
\
Months of work on developing the transportation infrastructure between
the core systems and the Colonia region are now coming to an end. Brewer
Corporation\'s latest press release specified the requirements:\
\
\"Phase four of the Colonia Bridge project has finally reached its
conclusion. Thanks to the many shipments provided by contributors, all
six starports now offer bartender, material trader and mission
services.\"\
\
\"For this final week, we are asking pilots to deliver auto-fabricators,
micro controllers and resonating separators to Macdonald Settlement in
the Alcor system. These will allow us to install outfitting, shipyard
and tech broker services as we bring the starports to full operational
status.\"\
\
\"Brewer Corporation is grateful to independent pilots for their
dedication to constructing the Colonia Bridge. We are therefore pleased
to offer various classes of pre-engineered, overcharged power plants as
well as exploration decals to the top 75% of contributors to this
concluding stage.\"\
\
\"Finally, this is the last chance for pilots to obtain a Brewer
Corporation decal, which will be awarded to every contributor to any of
the Colonia Bridge initiatives as a token of gratitude.\"\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to five starports branching out from Alcor, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Outfitting\
Tier 2: Shipyard\
Tier 3: Human Tech Broker\
\
If Tiers 1, 2 and 3 are successfully reached, the top 75% of
participants will be awarded a 3A, 4A and 5A Pre-Engineered Overcharged
Power Plant respectively.\
\
The Exploration decals are available for participating in this final
initiative only. The decal colours provided are based on contribution as
follows:\
\
Top 75%: Emissive Red, Emissive White and Emissive Blue\
Top 50%: Bronze\
Top 25%: Silver\
Top 10%: Gold\
\
These decals will be awarded cumulatively.\
\
The top ten contributors for each of the Colonia Bridge initiatives will
have the opportunity to be named in tourist beacons that will
commemorate the project\'s conclusion. Every Commander who has
contributed to any of the Colonia Bridge initiatives will receive a
Brewer Corp decal.\
\
This campaign begins on the 3rd of March 3308 and will run for one week.
