The Holloway Bioscience Institute in Colonia is offering high payouts
for delivering samples from space-dwelling lifeforms. Jaques Station,
which is also in the Colonia system, has agreed to serve as the delivery
point for this initiative.\
\
Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir outlined the requirements:\
\
\"There is still a huge amount to learn about the fascinating structures
that grow within the vacuum of space. As our stock of specimens is
running low, we require fresh tissue samples from living organisms to
continue our experimentation programme.\"\
\
Pilots are requested to deliver Pod Core Tissue, Pod Dead Tissue, Pod
Mesoglea, Pod Outer Tissue, Pod Surface Tissue, Pod Shell Tissue or Pod
Tissue to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.\
\
If successful, decals will be rewarded to the top 75% of participants by
the 15th of January 3307.\
\
Each successful tier will provide the Holloway Bioscience Institute with
enough material and data to establish one experimental habitat for
space-dwelling lifeforms in a nearby system, enabling it to further its
studies.\
\
The initiative begins on the 7th of January 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
