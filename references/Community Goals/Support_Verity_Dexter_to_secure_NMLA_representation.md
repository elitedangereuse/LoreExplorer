Rival candidates have requested deliveries of data to help secure their
bids to lead the Marlinist Consulate.\
\
The Marlinist Colonies are voting for who will be elected as their prime
consul. This influential role will diplomatically represent all
Marlinists and make broad decisions on their behalf.\
\
The first candidate is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation
Party, which is acting as the NMLA political wing. She has the support
of Senator Lorcan Scordato to be made an Imperial patron:\
\
\"I am in a unique position to finally provide our people with a voice
in the Imperial Senate, and to speak for Neo-Marlinists. As prime
consul, I will negotiate a permanent peace with the NMLA.\"\
\
The second candidate, Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement, is
focused on sustaining the Marlinist Colonies:\
\
\"Neo-Marlinism and terrorism have no place within our republican
ideals. I will strive to keep our systems independent, and to protect
the rights of peaceful Marlinists everywhere.\"\
\
In order to support Verity Dexter and secure NMLA representation, she
has requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual
encrypted files to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.\
\
The Alliance, Empire and Federation have recognised the Marlinist
Consulate as an ambassadorial body, and agreed that the election of its
prime consul is a strictly internal matter.\
\
The initiative begins on the 15th of July 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, this campaign
will end immediately.\
Should both initiatives be completed to the same tier, the one with the
highest contribution will be designated the victor.
