Galactic News: Tantalum Appeal Extended\
11 MAY 3302\
The Wyrd Raiders have announced that their campaign for tantalum has
been extended. A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed that this
was to ensure targets would be met.\
\
In a brief statement, the spokesperson said:\
\
\"We are extremely grateful for the support we have received so far. But
it is clear that for this campaign to succeed, we will need to give
pilots more time to source the tantalum we have asked for.\"\
\
The campaign is now scheduled to end on the 19th of May 3302.\

Deliver Tantalum to Gareth Edwards Park in the Wyrd system to help the
Wyrd Raiders meet their mysterious order\
\
\
The Wyrd Raiders may not be widely known outside the Wyrd system, but
for several years it has been one of the most successful commercial
enterprises in its region of space, enjoying profitable relationships
with an array of partners. Now the organisation has issued an appeal to
the galactic community for help in compiling an order of tantalum for an
unnamed party. A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief
statement to the media:\
\
"Ordinarily we would have no difficulty meeting an order of this kind,
but given the relative urgency of the request we have decided to place
an open order for the necessary materials. Naturally we will generously
reward those who lend us their support."\
\
The spokesperson was asked to address rumours that the tantalum was in
fact intended for a group of independent engineers, but she refused to
be drawn on the subject:\
\
"Our partners usually prefer to keep their identities private, since
their transactions are often of a commercially sensitive nature."\
\
The Wyrd Raiders has promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum to
Gareth Edwards Park in the Wyrd system.\
