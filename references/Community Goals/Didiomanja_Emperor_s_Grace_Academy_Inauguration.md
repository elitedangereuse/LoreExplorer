The Didiomanja Emperor\'s Grace has completed work on the Tiverion
Academy, a flight school for Imperial Navy cadets. The organisation is
hosting an inaugural banquet to mark the event, and to honour the late
Admiral Mira Tiverion, the organisation\'s founding member, who will
have a monument erected at the site.\
\
A spokesperson for the Didiomanja Emperor\'s Grace released the
following statement:\
\
\"The Tiverion Academy will provide new recruits with cutting-edge
training facilities. To host a fitting banquet for its inauguration, we
require help in sourcing a range of exotic food and drink. We also
require a number of mined commodities to make the monument raised in the
Admiral\'s memory a truly spectacular tribute.\"\
\
In support of this initiative, the Didiomanja Emperor\'s Grace has
placed an open order for exotic food and drinks, which will be served at
the celebratory banquet.\
\
The campaign begins on the 5th of July 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Haiden Black Brew, Neritus Berries and HIP Proto-Squid
to Leydenfrost Dock in the Didiomanja system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the inactive from running
smoothly.
