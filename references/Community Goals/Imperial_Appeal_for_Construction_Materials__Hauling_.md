In recent weeks, both the Empire and the Federation have accelerated
their expansion plans in the Maia and Merope systems, deploying dozens
of ships and establishing a number of outposts. The latest phase of
these campaigns will see both superpowers constructing bases in the
Pleiades region.\
\
The Empire has authorised the Merope Expeditionary Fleet to coordinate
its campaign, while the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has agreed to
oversee the Federal appeal. Both organisations have placed open orders
for construction materials, promising to reward pilots who deliver
Tantalum, Building Fabricators and Thermal Cooling Units to their
respective bases of operation -- PRE Logistics Support Gamma for the
Federal campaign and Moni\'s Hub for the Imperial initiative.\
\
Both campaigns begin on the 25th of May and will run for one week. If
either the Empire or the Federation meets its targets earlier than
planned, its campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Tantalum, Building Fabricators, and Thermal Cooling
Units to Moni\'s Hub in the Maia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
