Since the non-human structures known as barnacles were first discovered,
they have prompted fierce debate, attracted intense scrutiny and even
triggered the dispatch of a Federal Fleet to the Merope system.\
\
As the only known source of meta-alloys, the barnacles are of
considerable value. It is therefore unsurprising that the Empire has
issued an appeal for exploration data in the hope of finding more. A
spokesperson for Bava Blue Travel Systems, which is coordinating the
campaign, made the following statement:\
\
\"The barnacles are of central importance, and it is vital that we
determine whether or not there are any more out there. We are therefore
launching an appeal for exploration data, to begin at once, as part of a
search for further barnacles.\"\
\
The spokesperson was asked if the campaign had been prompted by the
Federation\'s decision to station battle cruisers at barnacle sites in
the Merope system, but she declined to comment.\
\
Bava Blue Travel Systems, on behalf of the Empire, has promised to
reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Bauschinger City in the
Bava system. The campaign begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run
for one week. If the Empire\'s targets are met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.\
