The Kumo Crew syndicate has launched an initiative to construct up to
five starports.\
\
Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, an independent construction company, has been
privately contracted by the Kumo Council to build fully operational
Orbis stations. These will be located in uninhabited systems close to
key trading regions and areas of commercial interest.\
\
The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed featured this statement from Archon
Delaine:\
\
\"As sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation, it\'s my responsibility to
increase prosperity for the systems under my protection. My new
starports will extend our reach and boost trading of all kinds...
legitimate and otherwise.\"\
\
\"I have also placed bounties on the heads of anyone who dares to
interfere with my plans. The one thing we never trade in is mercy.\"\
\
To support this initiative, hand in your bounties to The Razor Whips at
Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system.\
\
The initiative begins on the 15th of April 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met, the campaign will end immediately.
