Jupiter Division is fighting for survival against the Silver Legal Group
in the Ts\'ao Tach system.\
\
Jupiter Division was formed by rogue Core Dynamics departments loyal to
ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester. Although it was defeated in February, a
growing corporatist movement within the Federation has helped rebuild
its strength.\
\
A call to arms was made by Owen McKenna, the new CEO of Core Dynamics:\
\
\"Rochester\'s deranged cult must be wiped out once and for all. We are
supporting our ally, the Silver Legal Group, to destroy Jupiter
Division\'s fleet and allow us to retake our stolen resources.\"\
\
The Silver Legal Group has asked pilots to support its efforts to crush
Jupiter Division by handing in Combat Bonds at the Iron Wings of Justice
megaship in the Ts\'ao Tach system.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached or early on Thursday the 10th of June 3307.
