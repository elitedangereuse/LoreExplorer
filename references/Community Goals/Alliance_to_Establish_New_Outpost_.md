Noli Dock, Iyati system - Deliver Robotics, Semi Conductors or Auto
Fabricators to Noli Dock in the Iyati system to help in the construction
of a new deep space alliance outpost\
\
Harlyn Tavistok, a senior member of the Alliance Assembly, has announced
plans to establish a new outpost on the fringes of inhabited space.
According to Tavistok, the new station will provide the Alliance with "a
vitally important new resource, significantly bolstering our
reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering capabilities." An Alliance
spokesperson provided further details:\
\
\
"Monitoring activity within human-inhabited space is of central
importance to our continued security, but this particular sector
currently contains a limited number of operational outposts. Our new
station will address this issue."\
\
\
"To support this campaign, we have placed open orders via our partners
at HIP 55118 General Corporation for Robotics, Semi Conductors and Auto
Fabricators. Pilots who deliver these essential commodities to our base
of operations at Noli Dock will be generously compensated."\
