Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced plans to build a
Dionysus-class Agricultural Vessel in support of ongoing
resource-extraction operations in the Pleiades. Once built, the enormous
starship will orbit a water world in the Pleiades Sector GW-W c1-15
system.\
\
In support of this operation, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed an
open order for marine equipment, micro controllers, crop harvesters and
coltan, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities
to Potagos Port in the Wangal system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 14th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
