The Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition has announced plans to
establish a series of starports between the core systems and Colonia to
make the daunting voyage a little easier. A total of three starports
have been planned, which the Chapterhouse hopes will expedite the
creation of a freight and passenger service known as the Blue Star
Line.\
\
The Chapterhouse has placed an open order for gold, robotics and
auto-fabricators for the first of these starports, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Shajn Market in the
Kamadhenu system.\
\
Announcing the campaign, Governor Shelby Ortega said:\
\
The growth of Colonia has been astounding, but its continued success
depends on developing more substantive infrastructure. Having received
the blessing of the Colonia Council, the Chapterhouse of Inquisition
intends to realise a vision of trans-galactic commerce that will benefit
all of humanity.\
\
The first phase of the campaign begins on the 24th of August 3303. The
second phase begins on the 31st of August, and the final phase begins on
the 7th of September. All three phases will run for one week unless
targets are met earlier than planned.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering gold, robotics and auto-fabricators to Shajin Market
in the Kamadhenu system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
