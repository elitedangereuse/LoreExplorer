With work on the first Chapterhouse of Inquisition starport now well
underway, the organisation\'s ambitious project has entered its second
phase. The aim of the project is to establish a series of starports
along the route to Colonia, and expedite the creation of a new freight
and passenger service to the remote region.\
\
For this stage of the project the Chapterhouse has placed an open order
for Beryllium, Military Grade Fabrics and Insulating Membranes, which
will be used to build a second starport. Pilots who deliver these goods
to Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system for will be generously
reimbursed. System authorities have also pledged to issue above-average
rewards for Chapterhouse-issued bounties, to ensure safe delivery of
goods to the starport.\
\
Governor Shelby Ortega released the following statement:\
I was overwhelmed by the response to our first appeal, and I hope the
galactic community will be as enthusiastic about the next phase of the
campaign.\
\
The second stage of the campaign begins on the 31st of August 3303 and
will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned,
the campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Beryllium, Military Grade Fabrics and Insulating
Membranes to Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
