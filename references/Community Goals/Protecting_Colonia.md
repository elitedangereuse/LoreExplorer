As the Thargoid offensive continues, authorities in Colonia have decided
to step up security by building a new security installation in the
region.\
\
A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the
initiative, gave the following statement:\
The Thargoids have now entered the core systems, and their hostility
shows no signs of abating. Meanwhile, Colonia\'s defensive capabilities
remain limited. It is clear to us that the time to act has come.\
\
Colonia Council has agreed to fund the operation , and has placed an
open order for various mined resources for use in the construction.
Pilots who deliver the requested resources to Dove Enigma in the Colonia
system will be generously compensated.
