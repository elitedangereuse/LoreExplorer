Combat pilots are required in the Upaniklis system to assist the
Golconda in resuming its voyage.\
\
The ancient generation ship, which originated from Earth in the 22nd
century, has been retrofitted by the Artificers Clan into a functional
modern vessel. The majority of its former population have decided to
leave the outpost Forester\'s Choice and return to their traditional
nomadic lifestyle.\
\
Captain Jonathon Forester, leader of the Golconda Union, announced:\
\
\"In 3305 the galactic community provided us with the chance to end our
original journey, so it will be fitting if they can help us start a new
chapter among the stars.\"\
\
Local security forces warned that pirates may attempt to hijack incoming
shipments or take control of the Golconda itself. As a defensive
measure, Upaniklis Vision Incorporated has offered bounties on all
wanted ships in the system. Pilots are asked to deliver bounty vouchers
to Fozard Port.\
\
According to the Federal Diplomatic Corp, these events do not violate
the legislation that protects isolated societies from cultural
contamination. It added: \"Partnership status with the Federation has
been extended to the Golconda and continues to apply to Forester\'s
Choice outpost.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of June 3308 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
