In February this year, Princess Aisling Duval established a repatriation
centre for former slaves at D\'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system.
Since then the centre has gone from strength to strength, successfully
emancipating thousands of slaves and rescuing hundreds from the horrors
of illegal slavery.\
\
When the initiative launched, many of Princess Aisling\'s detractors
dismissed it as a publicity stunt, but her ongoing commitment to the
centre has silenced even her most ardent critics. It is understood that
she receives daily updates from D\'Arrest Station, and makes personal
visits once a month.\
\
It therefore comes as little surprise that, following news of an
outbreak at the starport, Princess Aisling has secured funding for a
relief effort. In a statement, the princess expressed concern for those
affected:\
\
"It is extremely important that the unfortunate people at D\'Arrest
Station receive help as soon as possible, and I implore the galactic
community to come to their aid. The Uibuth Empire Party has graciously
offered to coordinate the relief effort."\
\
The Uibuth Empire Party has promised to reward pilots who deliver Basic
Medicines, Advanced Medicines or Medical Diagnostic Equipment to
D\'Arrest Station in the Uibuth system. The campaign begins on the 17th
of November and will run for one week.\
