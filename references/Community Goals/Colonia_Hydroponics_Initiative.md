Authorities in Colonia have decided to build a state-of-the-art
hydroponics facility, due to research projecting a possible food
shortage in the region.\
\
Professor Diana VanCleef, a scientific adviser to the Colonia Council,
gave the following statement:\
The growing populace of Colonia means we need to provide a reliable and
sustainable source of food for the region. We aim to address this by
building a new hydroponics facility that will serve Colonia for
generations to come.\
\
The campaign is being run by Colonia Research Division, one of
Colonia\'s partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver
Aquaponic Systems, Water Purifiers and Water to Templar Barracks in the
Randgnid system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 16th of August 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Aquaponic Systems, Water Purifiers and Water to
Templar Barracks in the Randgnid system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
