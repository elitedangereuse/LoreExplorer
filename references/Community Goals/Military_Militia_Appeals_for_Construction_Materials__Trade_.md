The Military Militia, an independent organisation based in the XI-2 Lupi
system, has announced plans to establish an installation in its home
system, and has issued an appeal for various commodities for use in the
construction. Commander MiL1TiA SiX, the group\'s wing commander,
elaborated on the nature of the appeal:\
\
"We need two resources to start construction -- military grade fabrics
and platinum -- and we encourage all able and willing Commanders to
assist us."\
\
"Resistance is expected, but the Military Militia and its allies stand
at the ready. We will be patrolling the shipping lanes in order to keep
criminals at bay and ensure no crime goes unpunished."\
\
\
The proposed installation, which will be known as Soldiers\' Respite,
will boast state-of-the-art communication relays, high-tech weapon
systems and a combat training facility.\
\
The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested
commodities to Pellegrino Hub in the XI-2 Lupi system. The campaign
begins on the 9th March 3303 and will run for one week. If the final
target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Military Grade Fabrics and Platinum to Pellegrino Hub
in the XI-2 Lupi system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
