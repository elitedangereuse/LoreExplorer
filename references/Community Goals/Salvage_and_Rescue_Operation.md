A convoy travelling through the core systems has come under attack from
a pirate group, and local authorities are requesting assistance in
finding survivors.\
\
The operation is being coordinated by Security Chief Tal Woźniak of
United Carnoeck for Equality, who made this announcement:\
The convoy came under intense fire from pirates, with many ships damaged
or destroyed. We immediately despatched search-and-rescue teams, but the
volume of debris is significant, and we are therefore requesting help
from any independent pilots in the area.\
\
Our priority is to locate survivors, but we\'re also keen to acquire
data that might help to bring those responsible to justice.\
\
Pilots are requested to recover Occupied Escape Pods, Black Boxes and
Wreckage Components, and deliver them to Bacon City in the Carnoeck
system.
