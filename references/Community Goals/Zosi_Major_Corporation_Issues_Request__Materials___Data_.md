Zosi Major Corporation, an independent organisation based in the Zosi
system, has placed an open order for thermic alloys, chemical
manipulators and cracked industrial firmware. According to the
organisation\'s spokesperson, the resources will be used in an
unspecified research and development project.\
\
Dr Arkady Cole, the organisation\'s chief research scientist, released
the following statement:\
\
"We want the resources, yes? Very useful to us. Process is simple.
Deliver the resources and be paid. Yes."\
\
Despite the opaque nature of the request, it is likely the generous
reimbursements offered by the Zosi Major Corporation will ensure its
orders are met. Participating pilots have been instructed to deliver the
requested commodities to Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of November and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering thermic alloys, chemical manipulators and industrial
firmware to Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
