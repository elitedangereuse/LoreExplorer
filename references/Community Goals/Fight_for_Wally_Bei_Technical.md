Conflict has erupted between two opposing factions in the Wally Bei
system.\
\
Hostilities were triggered after Wally Bei Technical claimed to have
discovered stolen food shipments aboard their rival\'s transport
vessels. The faction\'s spokesperson said:\
Robbing innocent people of vital supplies is nothing less than an act of
war, and we are treating it as such.\
This was denied in an official response by the Wally Bei Constitution
Party:\
This outrageous accusation is intended to drive off our trade partners
and damage our economy. We won\'t tolerate such slander!\
\
Military leaders from both Wally Bei Technical and the Wally Bei
Constitution Party have issued calls to independent combat pilots,
offering rewards for their support.
