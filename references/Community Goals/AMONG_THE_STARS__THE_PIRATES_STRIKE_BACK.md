The Explorer\'s Association has issued an emergency statement regarding
their recent kill order on pirates in the Kaushpoos system.\
\"We are pleased with the response of independent pilots who helped wipe
out the opportunist agitators that were preying on our trade and mining
pilots.\"\
\"Unfortunately, the increased combat activity has attracted the
attention of organised criminal groups, who have started to attack ships
in the system. We urge all pilots to remain vigilant, and to defend
those in need from this new pirate threat.\"\
\
The Explorer\'s Association has issued a new appeal for help, with
increased rewards for those who eliminate the new pirate threat.
