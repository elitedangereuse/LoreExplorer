The Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery
facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid
base.\
\
A spokesperson for the Coalition said:\
\"Othime relies heavily on its refineries, but those refineries are
limited to small and medium cargo vessels, which limits the amount of
revenue we can generate. A new asteroid base would allow us to support
large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to
compete with other refineries in the sector.\"\
\
The organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and
has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that
those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who
contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Resonating Separators, Consumer Technology and
Advanced Catalysers to Levi-Montalcini Dock in the Othime system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
\
NOTE: The outpost does not have a large landing pad.
