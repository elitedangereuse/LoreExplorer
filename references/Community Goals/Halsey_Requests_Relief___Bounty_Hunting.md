Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has appealed for relief for the
refugees at Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
\
In support of this operation, the Revolutionary Patani Labour has placed
a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Yum Kamcabi, to ensure
those contributing aid can do so safely.\
\
The campaign begins on 30th of March 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system. Only
Bounty Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
