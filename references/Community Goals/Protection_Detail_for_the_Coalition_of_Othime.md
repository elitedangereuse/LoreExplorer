The Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery
facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid
base.\
\
A spokesperson for the Coalition said:\
\"Othime relies heavily on its refineries, but those refineries are
limited to small and medium cargo vessels, which limits the amount of
revenue we can generate. A new asteroid base would allow us to support
large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to
compete with other refineries in the sector.\"\
\
The organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and
has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that
those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who
contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Levi-Montalcini Dock in the Othime
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.
