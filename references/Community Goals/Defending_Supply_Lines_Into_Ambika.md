Authorities in Ambika system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking aid convoys and pilots travelling in the system,
disrupting famine relief efforts and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this treat, the Union Party of Ambika has placed a kill order
on all wanted ships operating in the Ambika system, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Goulart City.\
\
The campaign begins on 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
