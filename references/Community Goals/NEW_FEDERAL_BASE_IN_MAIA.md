The Federation has announced plans to construct a new outpost in the
Maia system, following last week\'s successful campaign to amass data on
the Pleiades Nebula.\
\
According to a Federal spokesperson, the new base will support naval
operations in Maia and the surrounding systems. The request mirrors one
issued by the Empire last week, which centered on the construction of a
new forward operating base in the Maia system.\
\
The Pleiades Resource Enterprise, on behalf of the Federation, has
placed an open order for Maia Auto Fabricators, Titanium, and Power
Generators for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver these
commodities to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system will be generously
rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 29th of September 3302 and will run for one
week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Maia Auto Fabricators, Titanium, and Power Generators
to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
