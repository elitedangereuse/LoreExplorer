New Federal Outpost\
\
Three weeks ago, the Federation ignited controversy with its decision to
establish a series of outposts in the Pleiades sector. The development
triggered a decisive response from Empire-aligned pilots, who made
repeated attempts to destabilise the campaign. Ultimately, the
Federation was able to complete the operation, but the Federation\'s
opponents had made their feelings clear -- the superpower\'s military
expansion would not proceed unopposed.\
\
Now the Federation has announced plans to establish a new planetary
outpost in the HIP 17225 system, which it claims will serve as "a trade
and resource-processing hub". Those familiar with HIP 17225 A 1 will be
all too aware that the planet is home to a number of barnacle sites.\
\
The Federation has placed an open order for tantalum, building
fabricators and energy grid assemblies with which to construct the new
base, and has authorised the Future of Segovan to reimburse pilots who
deliver these materials to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week.
If the Federation\'s targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
