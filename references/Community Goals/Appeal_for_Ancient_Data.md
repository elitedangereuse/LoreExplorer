Since the mysterious ruins in the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system were
discovered last week, the site has become a hotbed of activity, with
hundreds of explorers attempting to uncover the ruins\' secrets.\
\
Now the engineer Ram Tah has announced plans to conduct a comprehensive
research programme with the aim of learning more about the site.\
\
At a press event, Ram Tah made the following statement:\
\
"The discovery of the Synuefe ruins is hugely significant, and the site
is unquestionably worthy of further study. Fortunately, United Meene
Labour has graciously agreed to fund a comprehensive research project."\
\
"I am therefore in the privileged position of being able to devote
myself to studying data from the site. It is my hope that by decoding
this data, we can learn more about the civilization responsible for the
ruins."\
\
"Having conducted a preliminary survey of the site, I have determined
that Pattern Delta Obelisk Data would of great value at this stage."\
\
United Meene Labour has promised to reward pilots who bring Pattern
Delta Obelisk Data from the Synuefe ruins to Felice Dock in the Meene
system. The campaign begins on the 3rd of November 3302 and will run for
two weeks.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station service, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
\
\
Note: You will need Horizons to land on the planet for this CG, to use a
SRV to scan the glowing monoliths to get data. Not all of the scans are
Delta Data, you\'ll get Alpha Data, Delta Data & some other Data
too...so you will have to keep scanning them until you get Delta Data.\
