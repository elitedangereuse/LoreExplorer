The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group
have declared war in the Mudhrid system.\
\
The Steel Majesty megaship is serving as the base of the Neo-Marlinist
forces. These include many surviving NMLA terrorist cells that gathered
to overtake the vessel from the Marlinist Colonies.\
\
Also in the system is the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct, where the
NMLA\'s de facto leader Theta Seven and the remnants of Theta Group have
been in hiding for months. Margrave Corentin Delacroix, ruler of the
Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, broadcast a call to arms:\
\
\"All those who seek to topple the Duval dictators must fight alongside
us here and now. Neo-Marlinism has no future unless its believers defend
it.\"\
\
In an effort to draw support from independent pilots, the Neo-Marlinist
Order of Mudhrid is offering a uniquely augmented unmodifiable Class 2
Rating B enzyme missile rack with increased caustic damage and capacity.
The module will be delivered to the top 25% of contributors providing
Tier 1 is reached.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 2nd
of December 3307.
