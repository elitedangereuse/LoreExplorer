Two rival technology companies - Supratech and Herculean Machines - have
appealed for commodities to support the release of forthcoming
products.\
\
Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of Supratech, issued the following statement:\
\
\"The Torc is the latest in personal computing, featuring
state-of-the-art holographic technology. Anyone who wants to benefit
from the next generation in wearable hardware should support its
development.\"\
\
Meanwhile, Maddox Hurd, head of Herculean Machines, had this to say:\
\
\"The Duradrive cannot be rivalled for power or customisability. What
people need in this challenging age is a robust product, not some
ephemeral toy that malfunctions when exposed to a stiff breeze.\"\
\
To bring the Duradrive to market Anima Electronics Industries, which is
overseeing the initiative on behalf of Herculean Machines, has placed an
open order for Consumer Technology, Hardware Diagnostic Sensors, and
Computer Components. Pilots wishing to support Herculean Machines should
deliver commodities to Cowper Dock in the Anima system.\
\
The campaigns begin on the 20th of September 3304 and will run for one
week. If either party achieves its aims earlier than planned, both
campaigns will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Conductive Fabrics, Robotics and Microcontrollers to
Roberts Port in the Fedmich system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive event can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
