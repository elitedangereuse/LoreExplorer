To date, the Cerberus Plague has devastated several systems and claimed
thousands of lives. The only hope of eliminating the disease, and
curtailing further spread, is to develop as many doses of the cure as
possible. To further this aim, the Union Of Bast Liberals is offering a
series of incentives to pilots who take Ceremonial Heike Tea from the
Brunel City Station in Heike, to the Hart Station market until such time
as the Cerberus crisis has been halted.
