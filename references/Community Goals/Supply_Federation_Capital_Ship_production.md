The Federal Navy has requested commodities for the construction of new
capital ships in Parutis.\
\
President Zachary Hudson has convinced Congress to increase funding for
the Federal Navy, and to advance the construction programme for
Farragut-class Battle Cruisers. In a powerful address, he said:\
\
\"Defending the Federation is our highest priority in these uncertain
times. It is vital that we reinforce our capability to protect the
people from all threats.\"\
\
The Federal Navy urgently requires additional resources to meet the new
shipbuilding timetable. Deliveries of Building Fabricators, Microbial
Furnaces and Energy Grid Assemblies are requested by Labour Of Parutis
