Scientists in Colonia have announced plans to build a scientific outpost
in the system to monitor the region\'s population and resources.\
\
Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is heading the project, published this
statement:\
\
\"Our recent study into the region\'s population increase has revealed
alarming statistics. If Colonia\'s population continues to increase at
the current rate it could lead to a serious depletion of resources at
some point in the future.\"\
\
\"Monitoring infrastructure, terraforming, logistics and other issues
will require the construction of a dedicated centre for resource
management. This will allow us to study the aggregated data and
formulate a structured solution to avoid potential problems.\"\
\
The campaign is being run by Tir Technology Services, one of Colonia\'s
partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver commodities to
Bolden\'s Enterprise in the Tir system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of June 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
