A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Louguala. So
far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard McMullen City.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard McMullen City, the United Louguala Green
Party are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that provide
medicines to McMullen City market until such time as the crisis has been
averted.
