The Colonia Council has launched its fifth migration appeal, giving the
galaxy\'s minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent
presence in the Colonia Nebula.\
\
This month, the Council has targeted the following systems for
colonisation:\
\
•EOL PROU QC-K C9-65\
•EOL PROU VY-R D4-49\
•EOL PROU TD-S D4-60\
•EOL PROU RS-T D3-46\
•EOL PROU IW-W e1-3046\
•EOL PROU PX-T d3-122\
•EOL PROU LW-L c8-48\
•EOL PROU LW-L c8-322\
•EOL PROU PC-K c9-107\
•EOL PROU MW-L c8-16\
\
To compete for a migration visa, pilots must sign up with Colonia
Migration Services before delivering quantities of Galactic Travel
Guides to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.\
\
At the end of the appeal, the ten factions that have made the largest
contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified
systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for
the organisation\'s sole use.\
\
Be aware that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will be
considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction.\
\
The campaign begins on the 6th of April 3303 and will run for four
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To participate in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Jaques Station in the
Colonia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
