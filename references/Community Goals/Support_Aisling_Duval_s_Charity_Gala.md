A fundraiser hosted by Princess Aisling aims to finance a support
network for Imperial citizens affected by Thargoid aggression.\
\
The Citizens\' Relief Trust has been established in the Cemiess system,
prompted by the loss of thousands of military personnel during the
Battle of HIP 22460. She announced:\
\
\"While the Empire is focused on increasing its military strength, we
must not forget the human cost of ongoing conflict with the Thargoids.
Those who died in battle will be honoured by assisting the families and
dependants left to mourn them. The Citizens\' Relief Trust plans to
establish support centres to ensure their financial and emotional needs
are met.\"\
\
\"To raise funding, I have requested deliveries of Eshu Umbrellas, Xihe
Biomorphic Companions and Chateau De Aegaeon. These luxury commodities
will be auctioned or sold at a special gala I plan to host for Imperial
nobility, with all proceeds used to establish this network. Wine and
fish is also requested to serve to our distinguished guests.\"\
\
\"Although we cannot help those bereaved families who live beyond the
Empire\'s borders, I hope that the Citizens\' Relief Trust inspires the
creation of similar charities elsewhere.\"\
\
Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to Mackenzie Relay starport in
the Cemiess system. Along with credits, the following paint jobs will be
provided to qualifying contributors to a successful campaign:\
\
Top 75%: Dolphin Excursion Blue paint job\
Top 50%: Orca Asemic Black and White paint job\
Top 25%: Beluga Expedition Blue paint job\
\
These reward tiers are cumulative, with higher percentage qualifiers
receiving the rewards from previous tiers also.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of September 3308 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
