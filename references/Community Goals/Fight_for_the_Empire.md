Darkwater Inc in the Summerland system has been declared a hostile
military target for its role in abducting Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.\
\
The private military firm, led by Colonel Ronan Brock, was secretly
hired by the Lords of Restoration to train and equip the NMLA. Darkwater
troops also kept the Emperor imprisoned in a concealed bunker for over a
year.\
\
Once their involvement was revealed by ACT, Darkwater\'s forces
regrouped around the megaship Pearl Mandate. Colonel Brock led an
attempt to gain control of Summerland as a defensive measure but was
unsuccessful. The mercenaries have now been branded as wanted criminals
by the system authorities.\
\
The order to strike against Darkwater came directly from Emperor
Arissa:\
\
\"I call upon my loyal servants and all other warriors of honour to wipe
out this nest of traitors. We remember the innocent victims of the NMLA
by punishing those who enabled them.\"\
\
The Summerland Patron\'s Party will redeem combat bonds for destroyed
Darkwater ships at the starport Henry O\'Hare\'s Hangar. Although the
Summerland system is typically permit locked, the Empire has arranged a
total exemption for independent pilots for a three-week period.\
\
To guarantee that Darkwater is thoroughly eliminated, the Empire is
offering a range of incentives to pilots.\
\
The top 75% of participants will be elevated to the rank of Master in
the Imperial Navy Auxiliary. They will also receive Arissa
Lavigny-Duval\'s Powerplay Decal as an additional thanks.\
\
The top 25% of participants will additionally receive a permanent permit
for the Summerland system, as well as a special Empire Combat Zone
decal.\
\
The top 10 players will be granted an Imperial Hammer for their
service.\
\
Additionally, a permanent 10% discount on Imperial ships will be
available at Henry O\'Hare\'s Hangar, with temporary additional
discounts possible depnding on which Tier is reached.\
\
Tier 1 - 10% permanent on ships\
Tier 2 - 15% temporary on ships + Imperial Hammer\
Tier 3 - 20% temporary on ships + Imperial Hammer\
Tier 4 - 25% temporary on ships + Imperial Hammer\
Tier 5 - 30% temporary on ships + Imperial Hammer\
\
The Empire has declared their intention to wipe out the Darkwater Inc
faction by the 24th February 3308
