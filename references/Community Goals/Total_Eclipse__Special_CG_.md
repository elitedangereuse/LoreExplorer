The Kpelidoog Empire Assembly, an Imperial organisation based in the
Kpelidoog system, has announced plans to build a new Wells-class Carrier
to support astronomical research.\
\
In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:\
\
\"Many of the galaxy\'s scientific groups are currently focused on the
Thargoids, but we think it\'s important to keep an eye the bigger
picture. Once complete, this new ship will gather data on stellar bodies
and unusual celestial phenomena.\"\
\
The Kpelidoog Empire Assembly has placed an open order for titanium,
semiconductors and power generators for use in the construction, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Hipparchus
Terminal in the Kpelidoog system.\
\
The spokesperson went on to say:\
\
\"The success of this initiative depends largely on the support of the
galactic community. That\'s why we\'ve decided to incorporate the name
of the pilot who makes the largest contribution into the name of the new
vessel.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 21st of August 3303 and will run until the
24th of August 3303. If the final target is met earlier than planned,
the campaign will end immediately.\
