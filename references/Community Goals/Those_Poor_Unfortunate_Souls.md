Following the evacuation of millions of refugees from Quivira,
Summerland now finds itself hosting a veritable horde of women and
children. Many of whom lack access to even the most basic necessities.\
\
In response to their plight, the people\'s princess has asked her
supporters to help provide the innocents of Quivira with the good they
need to help them through these troubling times.\
\
Any space Fruit, Vegetable, Grain, Animal Meat and Fish would be
gratefully received. Similarly, anyone willing to supply a large
quantity of Food Cartriges and Synthetic Meat will find themselves
favoured by the diva Duval.
