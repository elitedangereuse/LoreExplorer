The Rogue Runners, an independent group based in the Run system, have
announced plans to restore and expand Leif Enterprise, an asteroid base
in their home system. In support of this goal, the organisation has
placed an open order for various commodities.\
\
To ensure those contributing commodities can do so safely, the Rogue
Runners\' security department has pledged to reward combat pilots for
any Rogue Runner Bounty Vouchers handed in at Smithport in the Run
system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 30th of November and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Smithport in the Run system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
