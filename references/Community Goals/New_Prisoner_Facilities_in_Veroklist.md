The Empire has announced plans to construct a new Riker-Class Prison
Ship in the Veroklist system.\
\
Once complete, the ship will house criminals who accepted a period of
Imperial slavery in lieu of a jail sentence, but who have proved to be
too dangerous or unstable for such corrective punishment.\
\
The Moritasgus Imperial Corporation, which is overseeing the initiative,
has placed an open order for Imperial slaves and non-lethal weapons,
promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Vaucouleurs
Vision in the Veroklist system.\
\
Moritasgus Imperial Corporation spokesperson Superintendent Arnold
Cochran released the following statement:\
\
"We are pleased the Empire has awarded us this contract, and we look
forward to the first ships arriving with our new guests."\
\
Note: Vaucouleurs Vision is an outpost, no Large Pads available.
