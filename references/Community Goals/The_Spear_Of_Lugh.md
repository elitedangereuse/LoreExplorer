The Federation are attempting to expand their control over the skied of
Lugh. That cannot be allowed to happen.\
\
If the Federation wants a war, then the Crimson State Group will happily
oblige. Éamonn Uí Laoghire has called on all true allies of freedom to
gather together to show the Federation that they will not be allowed to
maintain control of their subjects through means of oppression and
fear.\
\
To ensure that Lugh receives the helps it needs, the Crimson State Group
is offering sizable sums of credits to any mercenaries who agree to
fight on the side of an Independent Lugh.
