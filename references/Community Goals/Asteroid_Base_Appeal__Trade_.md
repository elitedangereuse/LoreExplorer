NULL, an independent organisation based in LTT 4961, has announced plans
to build a new base at Greg\'s Legacy, a large asteroid named after one
of the organisation\'s founding members.\
\
The organisation has placed an open order for Titanium, Aluminium,
Copper and Tea in support of this initiative, and has promised to reward
pilots who deliver these goods to Conway City in LTT 4961.\
\
A spokesperson for NULL released the following statement:\
\
"Having secured the necessary funds, we are now in a position to offer
generous rewards to pilots who support this two-pronged initiative. With
the help of the galaxy\'s independent pilots, we hope to both expand the
economic power of LTT 4961 and bring peace to the system."\
\
The operation begins on the 13th of July 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Titanium, Aluminium, Copper and Tea to Conway City in
the LTT 4961 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
