Last week, the Alliance deployed a flotilla to the California Sector
BA-A E6 system in the California Nebula. The act proved controversial,
prompting accusations that the Alliance was attempting to lay claim to
the organic structures of the California Sector BA-A E6 system.\
\
In the wake of this development, the Alliance has announced plans to
construct a new outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4. According to an
Alliance spokesperson, the station will serve as "a centre for
scientific study, supporting our ongoing research into the organic
structures and meta-alloys".\
\
In support of this initiative, the Alliance has placed an open order for
Geological Equipment, Hazardous Environment Suits and Pesticides. 160
SOAR, which is coordinating the appeal, has promised to reward pilots
who deliver these commodities to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674
system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 13th of October 3302 and will run for two
weeks. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Geological Equipment, Hazardous Environment Suits and
Pesticides to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for two weeks, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station service, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
