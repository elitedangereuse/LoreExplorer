Conflict has erupted in Popontia as the Federation seeks to apprehend
True Chapters cultists of the Far God cult.\
\
Federal ships have been deployed in the Popontia system with the
intention of detaining all cultists and seizing the Dedicant megaship.
Governor Nadia Machado, representing Popontia Incorporated, declared:\
\
\"By order of President Hudson, all Thargoid worshippers are under
suspicion of espionage and abetting our alien enemies. The True Chapters
group is ordered to surrender for lawful questioning.\"\
\
Popontia Incorporated has been tasked with overseeing this mission.
Payment has been authorised for Federal auxiliaries and independent
pilots willing to pledge their support in subduing True Chapters
supporters.\
\
These unprecedented hostilities were commented on by Dr Alfred Ulyanov,
an academic authority on the Order of the Far God:\
\
\"This is the first time that members of this faith have not calmly
accepted their own fate. According to my research, the First Apostle
preaches that the Far God will transform her followers upon Its
manifestation, allowing them to survive while the rest of humanity is
extinguished. This has evidently motivated True Chapters adherents to
abandon their wholly passive stance.\"\
\
Both campaigns are being orchestrated by contacts in the system\'s
primary starport, Ryman Market.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 6th
October 3308.
