The latest development in the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict takes
the form of a statement from the Admiral Denton Patreus, who has
announced plans to add three new Majestic-class interdictors to the
Imperial fleet. The announcement comes only a week after the successful
conclusion of a Federal campaign to amass material for three new
Farragut-class Battlecruisers.\
In a candid statement, Admiral Patreus said:\
\"We cannot stand idly by while the Federation attempts to establish a
monopoly over the meta-alloys. And if the Empire does not oppose the
Federation, who will?\
So long as the Federation continues to expand its navy, we will continue
to match it, ship for ship.\"\
The Empire has placed an open order for supplies and has authorized the
Morai Nobles to reward pilots who deliver Autofabricators, Tantalum or
Superconductors to van de Hulst Vision in the Morai System.\
The campaign begins on the 25th of August 3302 and will run for one
week. If the Empire\'s targets are met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Autofabricators, Tantalum or Superconductors to van de
Hulst Vision in the Morai System.\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
