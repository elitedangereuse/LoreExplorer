Now that the Federation has declared Lucan Onionhead an illegal
narcotic, the farmers of Luca fear it won\'t belong before the Federal
Navy turns its attention on Tanmark. Never ones to bow to federal
oppression, the Defense Force of Tanmark are offering to pay premium
rates in order to get their hands on enough Land Enrichment Systems to
grow a sea of clones. If enough clones can be grown before the
Federation gets a chance to shut operations on Luca down, the resultant
spread of Lucan Onionhead to outlying system should stop Luca from
suffering the same fate as Panem.
