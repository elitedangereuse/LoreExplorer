Federal Governor Dalton Chase requests deliveries to the Andavandul
system to establish a xeno-peace envoy vessel.\
\
The initiative spearheaded by Chase, a member of the Liberal Party who
is currently campaigning for a congressional seat, intends to provide a
megaship for use in Thargoid Advocacy Project operations. He announced:\
\
\"The Federation\'s leaders are sworn to protect its people, yet our
aggressive interactions with the Thargoids have placed entire systems in
great danger. Order of the Far God cultists shouldn\'t be the image we
conjure when suggesting non-military options. It\'s time to prove that
we possess the capacity for peaceful relations with other species.\"\
\
\"The megaship established on behalf of the Thargoid Advocacy Project
will lead a non-partisan diplomatic mission representing humanity\'s
call for a ceasefire. Its purpose is to find ways to communicate with
the Thargoids and make peaceful overtures. Imagine it: diplomatic
channels between different races. Peace in our time! Lend us your
support to lay this foundation for a more harmonious future.\"\
\
Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar has agreed to host the pro-peace
megaship initiative, and will organise payment for shipments of computer
components, semiconductors and titanium to Blenkinsop Hub in the
Andavandul system.\
\
The campaign will end on the 27th of October 3308. If the final target
is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
