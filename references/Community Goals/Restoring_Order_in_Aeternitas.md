Authorities in the Aeternitas system have reported a sharp increase in
the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Aeternitas Industries has placed a kill
order on all wanted ships operating in the Aeternitas system, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Houtman City.\
\
The campaign begins on the 8th of December 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
