The Colonia Council has launched a third migration initiative, once
again giving the galaxy\'s minor factions an opportunity to establish a
permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula.\
\
To earn a migration visa, pilots must deliver Galactic Travel Guides to
Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation. At the end of the
month, the factions that have made the largest contribution will earn
the right to settle in one of the specified systems. A new planetary
outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation\'s sole
use.\
\
The campaign will run until the 2nd of March 3303. If the final target
is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately. To
participate in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Jaques Station in the
Colonia system.
