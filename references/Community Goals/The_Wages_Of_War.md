Acting under orders of Senator Denton Patreus, in association with
Silver Natural PLC, Quivira Electronics PLC has been charged with the
responsibility of securing assets currently held by residents of
Quivira. Military action has been authorized in order to recoup losses
incurred on a dept owed to the Senator by the People\'s Quivira for
Equality Party.\
\
The Senator offers a generous payment programme, which includes the
opportunity for pilots to earn significant bonuses for hitting their
targets.\
\
There is one small catch. The takeover of Quivira must be completed
before the People\'s Quivira for Equality Party manages to fortify their
position. If the Senator is forced to send in his private fleet all
bonus payments will be forfeit.
