Federal pilots and trusted allies, today we call on you to assist the
Azaleach Partnership in the search for Starship One.\
\
One last contact with the President came from the XX system, just 75
ligth years from our current position. Unfortunately, information
provided by the Sirius Corporation and Core Dynamics suggests that
Starship One could now be anywhere within at least a 200 light year
radius of Azaleach.\
\
Until such time as we have received confirmation that the President is
alive and well, all search and rescue teams are being asked to
thoroughly inspect every system in the sector. Any relevant scan data
should be delivered to the search co-ordinators at the Universal
Cartographic station aboard Leoniceno Orbital. It is hoped that
Universal Cartographic will be able to use any anomalies that may have
appeared since the last scan of the area to determine the whereabouts of
Starship One.
