Last year, a commemorative event was held for the late entrepreneur
Walter Waldo in the Gyvatices system. Not only was the memorial a
success, it became an event of collective remembrance, as pilots from
across the galaxy convened to honour people and events of personal
significance.\
\
Following the event\'s popularity, the Labour Union of Kauruk has
announced the first annual Remembrance Week. The event will give the
public an opportunity to remember absent friends and departed loved
ones.\
\
As preparations begin, the organisation has placed an open order for a
range of commodities and materials, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver these commodities to Moore Terminal in the Kauruk system.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement:\
Most of us have something we want to honour, celebrate, or remember.
This event will give the galactic community a chance to do just that, in
an atmosphere of mutual support.\
\
I believe this is something the galaxy needs -- now more than ever.
