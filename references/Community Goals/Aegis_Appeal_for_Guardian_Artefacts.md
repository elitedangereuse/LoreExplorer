Ancient objects left behind by the Guardians have been requested by
Aegis for a new anti-xeno research programme.\
\
The Guardians were an intelligent humanoid species whose civilisation
collapsed over a million years ago, and who were engaged in hostilities
with the Thargoid race.\
\
Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis Research, gave this statement:\
\
\"At the Galactic Summit, Aegis agreed to undertake a fresh analysis of
Guardian technology. The hope is that this will lead to the development
of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require
new samples to compare with Ram Tah\'s groundbreaking work on this
mysterious species.\"\
\
\"Guardian artefacts including those previously identified as caskets,
orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns are needed. These can be
unearthed from the ancient ruins scattered across dozens of worlds.\"\
\
Pilots are asked to deliver their shipments to Aegis Research at the
Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 75% of contributors will have Guardian
Gauss Cannons unlocked and a fixed Class 2 Rating B Guardian Gauss
Cannon placed into storage at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi
system by the 30th of April 3307.\
For the duration of this initiative, Aegis has organised for a Guardian
technology broker to be present on the Alexandria. For each tier above
Tier 2 that is reached, the technology broker will remain present on the
Alexandria for one additional week.\
\
The initiative begins on the 22nd of April 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
