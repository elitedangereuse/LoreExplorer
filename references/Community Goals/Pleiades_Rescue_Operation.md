After sustained Thargoid attacks on civilian targets in the Pleiades
Nebula, system authorities have launched a rescue operation to locate
and recover survivor\
\
The operation is being coordinated by Superintendent Marla Poulsen of
Aegis Research, who made this announcement:\
\
System authorities in the Pleiades have been channelling their resources
into combating the Thargoid menace. As a result, search-and-rescue
initiatives have been neglected, but we are determined to plug that gap.
That means a lot of civilians rescued from escape pods, which also means
a lot of hungry mouths to feed, so we\'ll need to bolster our current
food stocks as a precautionary measure.\
\
Pilots are requested to recover occupied escape pods and damaged escape
pods and deliver them to Donar\'s Oak in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55
system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 9th of August 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Occupied Escape Pods and Damaged Escape Pods to
Donar\'s Oak in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid sensor bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
