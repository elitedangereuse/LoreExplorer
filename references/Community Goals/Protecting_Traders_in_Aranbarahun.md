To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Barnes Terminal in the Aranbarahun system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.\
\
\
\
NOTICE:\
\
You can collect the bounties for the controlling faction named \"Null\"
in LTT 5013 on the Haz Res by the planet 2. These Bounties can be used
for the CG. Maybe there could be more neighbouring systems in the near
with that controlling faction.
