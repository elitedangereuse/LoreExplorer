The Federation has issued a public appeal for exploration data as part
of its ongoing operation in the Pleiades Nebula. The appeal is being
coordinated by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which released the
following statement to the media:\
\
\"Given the recent discovery of possible non-human wreckage in the
Pleiades, it is essential that we have comprehensive and up-to-date
information on the entire region. We are therefore asking for pilots to
sweep the Pleiades and deliver any resultant exploration data to Pre
Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.
Commanders who contribute to this initiative will be generously
rewarded.\"\
\
The announcement comes in the midst of animated debate over recent
Federal and Imperial action in the Pleiades.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of September 3302 and will run for one
week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Exploration Data to Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the
Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
