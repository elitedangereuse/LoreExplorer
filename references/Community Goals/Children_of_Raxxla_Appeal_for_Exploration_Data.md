The Children of Raxxla, an organisation operating out of the HR 6421
system, has issued an urgent request for exploration data. The request
follows news that the group\'s leader, Salomé, has been found guilty of
the attempted assassination of Denton Patreus.\
\
\"We believe the exploration data may be pertinent to the case against
Salomé.\" said a Children of Raxxla representative. \"We are convinced
the accusations against her can be disproved, but only if we have
sufficient evidence.\"\
\
\"We know Salomé undertook a quest to the Formidine Rift and other
locales, and we urgently need data from Hawkin\'s Gap, the Conflux and
the Formidine Rift. The navigation codes for these areas are PLAA AEC
IZ-N C20-1, PRU AESCS DL-W C15-37 and EAFOTS EU-R C4-1. We\'re looking
for stellar scans, planet information and any and all anomalies.\"\
\
The Children of Raxxla have promised to reward pilots who deliver
exploration data to Serebrov Terminal in the HR 6421 system. The
campaign begins on the 17th of November 3302 and will run for two
weeks.\
\
\"We cannot offer the best price, \" the representative said,
referencing a competing Federal campaign, \"but we trust that pilots
will do the right thing. Help us, and help her.\"\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Exploration Data to Serebrov Terminal in the HR 6421
system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for two weeks but if the final target is
met earlier than planned then campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
