In a move that has come as a surprise to many, the Empire and Federation
have announced a joint initiative to counter Thargoid activity in the
HIP 17692 system.\
\
The two-pronged operation will seek to reduce the Thargoid presence in
the region, and to recover personal effects, data and people from
Thargoid attack sites in HIP 17692.\
\
The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has been charged with coordinating the
rescue initiative, promising to reward pilots who deliver Occupied
Escape Pods, Damaged Escape Pods, Black Boxes and Personal Effects to
Blackmount Oribtal in the HIP 17692 system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 11th of January 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Occupied Escape Pods, Damaged Escape Pods, Black Boxes
and Personal Effects to Blackmount Oribtal in the HIP 17692 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
