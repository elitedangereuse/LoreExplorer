INARA website does not have the new system & station in it\'s database
yet so here is the actual location of this CG...\
Location = Eol Prou LW-L C8-76 \[Colonia Dream\]\
(Coriolis Starport, large pads available, 26 Ls from main star,
21,997.12 Ly from Sol)\
\
\
It has now been eight months since the first Colonia outpost was
established, and since then the colony has gone from strength to
strength.\
\
With the Colonia community continuing to expand, the Colonia
Co-operative has placed an open order for mined Gallite, Gold and
Methanol Monohydrate Crystals for the development of infrastructure
throughout Colonia and the surrounding systems.\
\
A spokesperson for the Colonia Co-operative released a statement:\
\
\"It would be impossible to overstate how many resources are needed to
sustain and grow the Colonia community. Suffice it to say that we are in
constant need. Fortunately, thanks to a series of corporate donations,
we are in a position to offer generous premiums to pilots who deliver
materials to Colonia Dream in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-76 system.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 13th of April 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
