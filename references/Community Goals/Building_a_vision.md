Over the past year, the Qa\'wakana system has become a focal point for
the Knights of Karma, a rapidly expanding organisation that has
attracted support from across the galaxy. Now the group has announced
plans to establish a new mining facility among the rings of Qa\'wakana
6.\
\
A spokesman for the organisation released a statement regarding the
proposal.\
\
"Plans for the facility are underway, but we will need the support of
the galactic community if the project is to succeed. We are therefore
offering generous remuneration to pilots who deliver construction
materials to Carpini Terminal in the Qa\'wakana system."\
\
The campaign begins on the 8th of June 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Bauxite, Coltan, Gold and Platinum to Carpini Terminal
in the Qa\'wakana system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
