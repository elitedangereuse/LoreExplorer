The Empire intends to build a new outpost in the Andhrimi system and has
placed an open order for materials for use in the construction.\
\
The Empire has authorised the Alectrona Imperial Society to coordinate
the campaign on its behalf, and the organisation has promised to reward
pilots who deliver Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assemblies and
Lithium to Yurchikhin Station in the Andhrimi system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 16th of March 3303 and will run for one week.
If the organisation achieves its aims earlier than planned, the
operation will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assemblies and
Lithium to Yurchikhin Station in the Andhrimi system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
