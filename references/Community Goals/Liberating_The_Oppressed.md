Aisling Duval, in association with Stop Slavery Stupid, has issued a
call asking all right minded Imperial citizens to stand up for the
freedom of their fellow man.\
\
It\'s common knowledge that the Empire considers its slavery system to
be the most humane example of enforced servitude in the entire galaxy.
The truth, sadly, is very different. On many worlds even the Imperial
Slaves are treated little better than animals. They are beaten, abused
and forced to live in squalor all while their masters benefit from the
fruits of their labour.\
\
In an effort to take a stand against this barbaric practice, for the
next 7 days all Imperial Slaves sold to Mackenzie Relay will be
automatically granted their freedom.\
\
Stop Slavery Stupid are aware that humanitarians taking part in this
emancipation program will almost certainly lose a significant number of
credits. As such a reward scheme has put in place to try and offset
donor\'s losses as much as possible.
