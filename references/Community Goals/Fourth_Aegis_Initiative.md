Aegis\'s campaign to counter the rising Thargoid threat has entered its
fourth phase. Once again, the tri-superpower organisation has secured
financial support from a corporate partner, which has placed an open
order for various commodities.\
\
As the campaign began, The Federal Times spoke to Elvira Martuuk, one of
many independent engineers contracted by Aegis, who is overseeing this
stage of the campaign. Martuuk said:\
The Thargoids\' ability to disable our ships is one of their most
formidable weapons. For the past few weeks I\'ve been working on a
device that I hope will protect human vessels from the Thargoids\'
immobilising field.\
The Khun Independent Governance has promised to reward pilots who
deliver Thargoid Cyclops Tissue Samples, Coltan and Beryllium to Cremona
Prospect in the Khun system.
