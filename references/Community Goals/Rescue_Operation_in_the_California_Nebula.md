The Alliance has reported that ships travelling to and from its
California Nebula outposts are coming under attack from pirates. The
attacks are of such frequency and ferocity that the bases are in danger
of being completely cut off.\
\
An Alliance spokesperson said:\
\
\"The systems lining the route to the California Nebula are strewn with
the wrecks of Alliance vessels, but with the pirates still an active
threat, we have been unable to recover escape pods from these
shipwrecks. We are therefore launching a two-pronged operation designed
to both thin the pirates\' numbers and recover the escape pods. We hope
we can rely on the support of the galaxy\'s independent combat
pilots.\"\
\
The operation has received financial support from the Turner Research
Group, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver Escape Pods to
Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
