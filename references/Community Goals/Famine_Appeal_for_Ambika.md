Authorities in the Ambika system have reported that the region is in the
grip of an acute famine. All efforts to shore up the agricultural
markets have failed, and the famine has even triggered bouts of civil
unrest. To make matter worse, opportunist pirates are targeting aid
convoys and independent traders attempting to deliver aid to the
stricken people of Ambika.\
\
The Union Party of Ambika has therefore issued an urgent appeal to the
galactic community to deliver foods to famine-struck Ambika. The
organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested
commodity to Goulart City in the Ambika system by paying 75% above the
galactic average.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering foods to Goulart City in the Ambika system.\
\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
\
Any food sold to the station is subsidized with a 75% price margin above
the galactic average price. (happy tea selling)\
