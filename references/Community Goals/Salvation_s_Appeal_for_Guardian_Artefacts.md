Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures have requested deliveries of
Guardian artefacts to the PMD2009 48 system.\
\
The rival campaigns follow the discovery of an ancient battleground
between the Guardians and the Thargoids on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2
1a.\
\
Patience Middleton, representing Taurus Mining Ventures, provided this
statement:\
\
\"\'Salvation\' has claimed the exclusive rights to exploit the Proteus
site, which was discovered thanks to his specialist knowledge. He has
contracted us to pay for Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems
and urns brought to the megaship Glorious Prospect.\"\
\
The Alliance, Empire and Federation consider depriving Aegis of
resources to be a criminal act. As a result, pilots are warned that any
ship modules received from Taurus Mining Ventures will be marked as
\'hot\', thereby incurring extra costs to be cleaned prior to
installation.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 10% of contributors will receive a focused
long-range high-penetration fixed Class 2 Guardian Shard Cannon with
additional weight, power draw and heat. This will be placed into storage
at the Glorious Prospect in the PMD2009 48 system by the 3rd of July
3307. If Taurus Mining Ventures outcompetes Aegis, the top 75% of
contributors will receive the module.\
\
The initiative begins on the 24th of June 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
