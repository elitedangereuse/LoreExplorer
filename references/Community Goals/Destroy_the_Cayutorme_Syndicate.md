The Empire has despatched a large military fleet to the Cayutorme system
to engage the mercenary group known as the Cayutorme Syndicate. The
organisation is understood to be responsible for supplying criminal
groups throughout Imperial space with illegal weapons, and the Empire is
eager to curtail the organisation\'s activities. To assist with the
operation, Gyriampi Empire League has been authorised to reward any
pilots who help combat the mercenaries.\
