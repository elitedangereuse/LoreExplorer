The Utopia movement has announced that the Sim-Archive is to undergo a
period of comprehensive maintenance.\
\
Pranav Antal, leader of Utopia, elaborated on the nature of the
project:\
\
\"The Sim-Archive is Utopia\'s primary achievement -- a vast digital
repository containing the collective wisdom of all our departed brothers
and sisters. But, like any system, the Archive requires constant
maintenance, as a failure in the system could result in the loss of
irreplaceable knowledge. We have therefore placed an open order for
various commodities for use in this delicate work.\"\
\
The Official Airman Di Front has been authorised to oversee the
initiative, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver the requested
goods to Chargaff Orbital in the Airman Di system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 8th of February 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Hybrid Capacitors, Phase Alloys and Conductive
Polymers to Chargaff Orbital in the Airman Di system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
