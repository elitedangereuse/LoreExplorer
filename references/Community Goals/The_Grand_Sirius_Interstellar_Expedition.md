Ever since mankind\'s first tentative steps to the stars, the Sirius
Corporation has prided itself on standing shoulder to shoulder with
those men and woman whose bravery and sacrifice led humanity safely
through the unknowns depths of space.\
\
In the last thousand years, a multitude of human civilizations have
spread themselves across our galaxy, and yet.... there is still so much
more for us to explore. Countless pristine worlds and countless more
fixer-uppers, just waiting to be discovered by those brave enough to
take that step into the unknown.\
\
To help inspire a new generation of galactic explorers, the Sirius
Corporation is pleased to announce the Grand Sirius Interstellar
Expedition. This is a month-long initiative to survey the uncharted
depths of the galaxy to find new habitable systems in which humanity can
flourish and grow.
