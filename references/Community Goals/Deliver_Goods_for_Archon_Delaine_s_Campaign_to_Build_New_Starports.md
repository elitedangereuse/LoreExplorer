The Kumo Crew syndicate has launched an initiative to construct up to
five starports.\
\
Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, an independent construction company, has been
privately contracted by the Kumo Council to build fully operational
Orbis stations. These will be located in uninhabited systems close to
key trading regions and areas of commercial interest.\
\
The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed featured this statement from Archon
Delaine:\
\
\"As sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation, it\'s my responsibility to
increase prosperity for the systems under my protection. My new
starports will extend our reach and boost trading of all kinds...
legitimate and otherwise.\"\
\
\"I have also placed bounties on the heads of anyone who dares to
interfere with my plans. The one thing we never trade in is mercy.\"\
\
The Razor Whips, one of Delaine\'s loyal factions, is organising the
campaign. It will reimburse pilots who deliver ceramic composites,
semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in
the Harma system.\
\
Each completed tier will ensure the installation of an Orbis station by
the 29th of April 3307. The starports will be located in the following
systems, listed in order of priority:\
\
Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system\
HIP 18390, near the California Nebula\
HIP 10792, near the Sothis system\
HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula\
Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region\
\
The initiative begins on the 15th of April 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
