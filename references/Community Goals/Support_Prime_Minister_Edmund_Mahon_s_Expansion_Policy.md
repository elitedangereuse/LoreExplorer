Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine have launched
rival delivery initiatives in Alliance space.\
\
The two leading candidates for Alliance prime minister are attempting to
gather public support, although the actual election will be determined
by votes within the Assembly on the 27th of May.\
\
Every opinion poll suggests that Mahon\'s victory is all but confirmed,
which will grant him a second six-year term. However, the outcomes of
these community drives will directly affect the successful candidate\'s
policies once in office.\
\
Prime Minister Mahon is focusing on increasing industrial materials to
aid expansion. He has requested that shipments of ceramic composites,
polymers and superconductors are delivered to Dublin Citadel in the
Gateway system.\
\
Should Prime Minister Mahon be the most successful, there will follow a
tritium mining initiative to support Alliance expansion. This will lead
to the construction of new Alliance starports.\
\
This week-long initiative will continue until the top target is reached
or time has run out.
