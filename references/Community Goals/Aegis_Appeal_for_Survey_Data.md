Aegis Research has issued a statement amid growing concerns that
meta-alloy harvests in the Pleiades Nebula have slowed dramatically. A
number of sources claim that Thargoid barnacle sites have recently
ceased producing materials.​\
​\
The situation was addressed by Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis
Research:​\
\
\"Thargoid structures remain poorly understood, so we can only theorise
why the barnacles in most Pleiades systems have grown barren. Our
leading hypothesis is that these sites have been over-exploited in
recent years, and humanity has simply exhausted this resource.​\
​\
What is certain is that meta-alloys are both a valuable commodity and a
vital component of anti-xeno technology. It is of paramount importance
that we maintain the supply of this material.​\
​\
Therefore, Aegis Research is spearheading an initiative to identify an
alternative source. We ask the galactic community to support us by
providing exploration data, in the hope this leads us to undiscovered
barnacle sites.​\"\
\
Independent pilots who wish to participate can do so by handing in
survey scans to The Oracle in the Delphi system between the 4th and the
10th of July.​\
