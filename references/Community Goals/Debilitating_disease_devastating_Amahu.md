A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Amahu. So far
the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best efforts
of medical staff aboard Alexandria Gateway.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Alexandria Gateway, the Amahu Labor are
offering a series of incentives to any pilots that provide medicines to
Alexandria Gateway market until such time as the crisis has been
averted.
