Core Dynamics, in association with the Federal Navy, is proud to
announce its intention to build a new marvel of the modern age, in form
of the latest Capital Ship to join the federal fleet. The Navy intends
to use this new ship to defend the Federation\'s borders by tracking
down all those who would threaten to unravel the fabric of our society.\
\
Of course such an endeavour doesn\'t come cheap, and it doesn\'t come
easy either. That\'s why Core Dynamics has a number of contracts
available for independent contractors with the resources to bulk supple
any of the materials listed in the manifest below.
