A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Dajoar. So far
the illness has defied all attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of the medical staff aboard Thiele Port.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that that
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
to assist medical staff aboard Thiele Port, the Movement for Dajoar
Independents are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that
provide medicines to Thiele Port market until such time as the crisis
has been averted.
