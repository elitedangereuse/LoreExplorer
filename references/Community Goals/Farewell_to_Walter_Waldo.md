Walter Waldo, founder of Wonderful Walter\'s Fish and Coffee Emporium,
passed into the black this week.\
\
In honour of one of the galaxy\'s great entrepreneurs, the Gyvatices
Crimson Advanced Holdings, in connection with Walter\'s family, has
organised a special memorial. The organisation has issued an appeal for
Fish and Coffee in support of this event, which should be delivered to
Walter Dock in the Gyvatices system.\
\
Walter\'s family released the following statement:\
\
"We are going to celebrate Walter\'s life with a special fish and coffee
festival. He was an avid fisherman, a keen coffee drinker a family man
and a philanthropist. We would like the whole of Walter Dock to be part
of this memorial.\"\
\
Business leaders in Gyvatices are supporting the appeal by offering
above-market prices for both Fish and Coffee at Walter Dock.\
\
The campaign begins on the 20th October 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
