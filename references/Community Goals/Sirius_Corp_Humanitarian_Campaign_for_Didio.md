Sirius Corporation has organised humanitarian support for the Didio
system, which is under attack by Thargoid vessels.\
\
The Alliance Defence Fleet is currently combating the Thargoid threat in
Didio, under the command of Admiral Rachel Ziegler.\
\
Admiral Nikolas Glass, who acts as a liaison between the megacorp and
the Alliance Defence Force, provided details of the campaign:\
\
\"With the strategic defence pact yet to be ratified, the Council of
Admirals has not approved the deployment of Sirius Navy ships as part of
an Allied fleet. However, Sirius Corporation is keen to show its
commitment to helping the Alliance, and will do so by supplying vital
resources to the Didio system\'s besieged population.\"\
\
\"Large quantities of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food
cartridges are urgently required. These can be delivered to Chariot of
Rhea in the Leesti system, from where they will be delivered to Didio in
military convoys.\"\
\
A joint operation between the superpowers is currently underway in
Didio, Novas and Sosong to counter recent Thargoid invasions. This is to
buy time for Salvation\'s anti-xeno superweapons to be constructed.\
\
The delivery campaign begins on the 28th April and will run until the
5th May 3308. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.
