The Lave Radio Network, an independent organisation based in the Lave
system, has announced plans to broadcast its annual conference, which
this year will take place in the Diso system from the 24th to the 25th
of June.\
\
To ensure they can share the event with the entire galaxy, the Lave
Radio Network has placed an open order for various commodities, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Lave Station
in the Lave system.\
\
But not everyone is enthusiastic about the event. The Lave Jet Family
has responded with a rival campaign expressly designed to undermine the
Lave Radio initiative, and has invited pilots to deliver commodities to
help construct a signal jammer.\
\
The two organisations have set out week-long operations to achieve their
aims, which will begin on the 7th of June 3304.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Power Converters, Energy Grid Assemblies and Power
Generators to Lave Station in the Lave system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
