Los Chupacabras, an independent faction based in the LFT 926 system, has
announced plans for a musical event known as the Jailhouse Rock and
Blues Music Festival.\
\
A spokesperson for the group issued the following statement:\
Our hope is that this will be the greatest music festival this side of
Sagittarius A\*. To quote Plato: \'Music is a moral law. It gives soul
to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm
and gaiety to life and to everything\'.\
\
In support of the event, Los Chupacabras have placed an open order for
quantities of beer, tobacco, coffee and narcotics, and have promised to
reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Meredith City in the LFT
926 system.
