The Khona People\'s Party is pleased to announce that Khona 3 has now
entered the third stage of its terraforming process. Technicians working
for Big G Corporation are currently in the process of preparing the
necessary equipment in order to launch the next stage.\
\
Unfortunately due to lack of Auto-Fabricators, the project has been
temporarily delayed until such time as an adequate supply of
Auto-Fabricators can be obtained.\
\
In order to get the project back on schedule, the Khona People\'s Party
are offering a range of rewards to pilots who help ship Auto-Fabricators
to the technicians aboard Ziemianski Enterprise before the project
enters stage 3.
