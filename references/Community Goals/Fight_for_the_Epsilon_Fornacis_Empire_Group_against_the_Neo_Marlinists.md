Conflict has erupted between the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group and the
Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.\
\
An investigation by ACT in the Mudhrid system confirmed that the Order
of Mudhrid provided logistical support for the NMLA\'s starport attacks.
Their agents infiltrated other local factions to transport enzyme bombs
to their targets.\
\
The faction has now renamed itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.
Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, its leader, has declared a revolution
against the Imperial Family. From his flagship, the Steel Majesty, he
announced:\
\
\"The corrupt Duvals will never give up their power, so we must take it
from them. All those who seek to change the established order -- join
us!\"\
\
The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group responded by engaging their forces in
battle. Senator Denton Patreus has ordered them to \"take revenge for
the \'Nine Martyrs\' atrocities.\" He added that pilots who support
their just cause by handing in Combat Bonds at Payne-Scott City in the
Mudhrid system will be well rewarded.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 10% of participants will receive a fully
engineered class 2 rating B long range and high capacity railgun with
feedback cascade.\
Should the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group be victorious the top 75% of
participants will receive the module.\
The module will be placed in storage at Payne-Scott City in the Mudhrid
system by Friday the 9th of April 3307.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 8th of April 3307. If the final target is met earlier
than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
