Community Goal: Clean up Orulas\
\
25 FEB 3302\
\
For years, the sparsely populated Orulas system has been dominated by
the Orulas Blue Hand Gang, a ruthless criminal organisation. This
cold-blooded band has been making life intolerable for the system\'s
inhabitants, but the local government appears reluctant to take a stand.
Some have speculated that this is because the authorities receive
regular kickbacks from the criminals.\
\
But one resident has had enough. Rose Trebek, a former soldier and
veteran of countless military campaigns, has established a defence
initiative to clean up Orulas -- the Joint Security Taskforce.\
\
\"I\'m sick of these scumbags running my system,\" said Trebek, \"and
I\'m sick of the government looking the other way. It\'s time to take
care of these punks. But we can\'t do it alone.\"\
\
\"Our intelligence indicates that the Blue Hand is ferrying its spoils
in big convoys to various fences. They trade mostly in escape pods,
which they sell to shady pseudo-scientific outfits conducting illegal
human experiments. We need pilots to swoop in, bust open the convoys,
and recover as many pods as they can. We also need volunteers to sweep
the system, taking out any Blue Hand ships they encounter. That should
make things easier for the Commanders targeting the convoys.\"\
\
Trebek has the resources to offer generous incentives to those who
support the campaign. But she has stressed that the operation will not
be straightforward:\
\
\"If you\'re not an experienced combat pilot, frankly you can\'t help
us. These Blue Hand dirtbags are the real deal. I don\'t want your death
on my conscience.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 25th of February 3302 and will run for one
week.\
\
Note: beware if you\'re interested in bounty hunting: despite its
description, this CG is a combat one (in combat zones) not a bounty
hunting one.\
