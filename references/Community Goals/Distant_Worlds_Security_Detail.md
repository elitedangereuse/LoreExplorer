The organisers of the Distant Worlds II expedition have requested
materials for two construction projects in the Galactic Centre.\
\
The exploration fleet aims to build a megaship and installation in the
Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system.\
\
Dr Kaii, Fleet Liaison for Deep Space Surveys, explained:\
\
\"This installation will be a place for scientists to study the
supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A\*. Future explorers visiting
the station will be well looked after by Deep Space Surveys, to whom we
will hand the keys before continuing to Beagle Point.\"\
\
To protect contributors to the mining side of the campaign, Deep Space
Surveys have authorised bounty vouchers for all wanted vessels.
