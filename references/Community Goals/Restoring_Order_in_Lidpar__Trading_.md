Authorities in the Lidpar system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally spreading discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Union of Lidpar Green Party has promised to
reward pilots who deliver Battle Weapons, Reactive Armour, and Advanced
Medicines to Carlisle Station in the Lidpar system, to support local
security forces.\
The campaign begins on 23rd of March 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Battle Weapons, Reactive Armour and Advanced Medicines
to Carlisle Station in the Lidpar system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
