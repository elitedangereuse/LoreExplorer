Imperial intelligence has discovered new Emperor\'s Dawn bases in the
Namarii, Tabaldak and LTT 874 systems. Senator Denton Patreus, who is
spearheading the campaign against Emperor\'s Dawn, has dispatched
several squadrons of Imperial fighters to these systems. The Namarii
Movement, Tabaldak Imperial Society and the LTT 874 Empire Party have
been authorised to reward pilots who help fight the insurgents.\
