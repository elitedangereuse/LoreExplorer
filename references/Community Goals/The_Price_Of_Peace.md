As part of ceasefire agreement brokered on behalf of the Law Party of HR
7327 and the Dukes of Mikunn, the Kwatee Union has graciously agreed to
allow both parties use of Herreshoff Gateway as a neutral meeting ground
with the aim of forging a lasting peace between the two previous
allies.\
\
Before relation soured, mercenaries from Mikunn supported the Law
Party\'s coup against the previous regime, Dynamic Commodities. However,
tensions have risen in recent months as the Dukes expanded their
influence in nearby star systems and thus began posing a threat to the
Law Party, the controlling faction of HR 7327.\
\
In a compromise to help secure their control of HR 7327 and avoid
further bloodshed, the Law Party has agreed to provide the necessary
technical expertise to construct and launch a space station in the
nearby uninhabited Col 285 Sector UG-I B24-6 on behalf of the Dukes of
Mikunn.\
\
In order to show good faith, the Dukes must provide the resources
required for the build within the next 7 days. If the Law Party suspect
foul play, the peace talks will fail resulting in open conflict between
the two groups.
