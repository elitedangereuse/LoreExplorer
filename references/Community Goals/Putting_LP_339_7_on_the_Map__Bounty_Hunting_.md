Dr Lewis Chapman, CEO of the Starship Enterprises Corporation, has
announced plans to establish a wildlife reserve in the LP 339-7 system.\
\
In support of this project, the corporation has placed a kill order on
all wanted ships operating in LP 339-7 to ensure that those contributing
commodities to the trade campaign can do so safely. Pilots who hand in
Bounty Vouchers at Whitson Orbital in the LP 339-7 system will be
generously rewarded.\
\
The campaign begins on the 15th of December 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final targets are met earlier than planned the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Whitson Orbital in the LP 339-7
system. Only Bounty Vopuchers handed in after signing up will count
toward your personal contribution total\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a proportion of your
bounties will be automatically assigned to them. These bounties will not
count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for these bounties when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounties assigned to your crew will depend on their rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
