The Empire\'s counter-terrorism operation in the LTT 1935 system has
triggered armed resistance from the Federation.\
\
The Imperial Internal Security Service\'s investigation into the NMLA
terrorist group led its agents to LTT 1935, a Federation-controlled
system in neutral space. Military vessels were called in for support,
only to be met in combat by Federal forces.\
\
A declaration was made by Colonel Ernest Harris of the LTT 1935
Confederacy:\
\
\"The Empire cannot dominate and arrest our citizens as it did with the
Marlinists. We claim the right to defend the Federation\'s territory
from such aggressive tactics.\"\
\
Captain Axel Cyprian of the L.Y.S Corp responded:\
\
\"The IISS has confirmed that the Neo-Marlinists have secret bomb-making
factories concealed within LTT 1935. To prevent future atrocities, it is
vital that we take control of this system and shut down the NMLA\'s
source of weapons.\"\
\
The LTT 1935 Confederacy has requested help from independent pilots to
defend LTT 1935 from occupation by the Empire. With the agreement of
Congress, the top 75% of participating Commanders will be raised one
military rank, the top 25% will be raised two military ranks and, should
victory be secured, the top 10 Commanders will be elevated to the
highest military rank by the 14th of November 3306.\
\
The two factions have set out week-long campaigns, which will begin on
the 5th of November 3306.
