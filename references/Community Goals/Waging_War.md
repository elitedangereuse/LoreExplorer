Acting under orders of Senator Denton Patreus, in association with
Silver Natural PLC, the Conservatives of BV Phoenicis are in the process
of launch an assault on Saavedra Dock in order to reclaim assets
currently illegally held by residents of Kui Hsien.\
\
As Senator Patreus has authorised the use of full military force to
recoup losses incurred on debts owed to the Senator by the Friends of
Kui Hsien, the Conservatives of BV Phoenicis are offering a range of
generous payments to all mercenaries willing to fight for his cause.
This includes the opportunity for pilots to earn a significant set of
bonuses for hitting their targets.
