The Alliance has announced plans to build an Orbis starport in the
Synuefai EB-R c7-5 system, between the core systems and the Alliance\'s
outposts in the California Nebula.\
\
Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:\
\
\"The remoteness of our California Nebula outposts makes reaching them a
potentially dangerous proposition. This new starport will bridge the gap
between the settlements and the galactic core, and lessen the risk to
ships journeying to and from the California Nebula.\"\
\
The initiative is being overseen by the LP 128-32 Corporation, which has
placed an open order for various raw materials for use in the
construction. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships
on it\'s wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material to the
campaign can do so safely.\
\
The campaign begins on the 1st of February 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Osmium, Samarium, and Lithium Hydroxide to Bulychev
Hub in the LP 128-32 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
