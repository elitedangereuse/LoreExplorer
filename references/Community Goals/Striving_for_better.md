Carns is looking to invest in the future and change its base economy.
With incentives from the local authorities, local start-ups are
developing High Tech-based trade. Financial and investment experts
believe that Commanders in the area could benefit greatly from
supporting these new businesses by importing vast amounts of Robotics.\
\
Carns Imperial Society has started sponsoring trade of Robotics in an
attempt to take advantage of the situation. It has prepared a series of
rewards for Commanders trading Robotics at Humason Orbital.
