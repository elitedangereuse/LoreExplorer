The Sirius Corporation has issued a request for Osmium in order to
elevate the economy of HIP 8396. The project is the first of a series of
initiatives designed to boost systems recently brought under Sirius
Corp. control. To assist with this effort, Sirius Corporation is
offering a series of incentives to pilots who deliver Osmium to Stepping
Stone Base until such time as targets have been met.\

Current closest pristine metallic rings = HIP 4318, about 45Ly away from
HIP 8396. Redditors in the Elite Mining subreddit are also reporting
high amounts of Osmium in the A ring of the planet Stepping Stone
orbits.)\
