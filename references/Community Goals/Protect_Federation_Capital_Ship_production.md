The Federal Navy has requested commodities for the construction of new
capital ships in Parutis.\
\
President Zachary Hudson has convinced Congress to increase funding for
the Federal Navy, and to advance the construction programme for
Farragut-class Battle Cruisers. In a powerful address, he said:\
\
\"Defending the Federation is our highest priority in these uncertain
times. It is vital that we reinforce our capability to protect the
people from all threats.\"\
\
The Federal Navy urgently requires additional resources to meet the new
shipbuilding timetable. Deliveries of Building Fabricators, Microbial
Furnaces and Energy Grid Assemblies are requested at Schweickart City in
the Parutis system.\
\
Labour Of Parutis has requested the support of independent pilots to
counter any piracy or other acts that may interfere with the supply of
commodities for the capital ships, and will handsomely reward such
efforts.\
\
If successful, decals will be rewarded to the top 75% of participants by
the 5th of December 3306.
