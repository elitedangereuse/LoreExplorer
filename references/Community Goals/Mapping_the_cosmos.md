The Cemiess Empire Party has issued an open contract for Exploration
Data on behalf of the Imperial Internal Security Services, the
organisation responsible for security throughout the Empire. According
to an IISS spokesperson, the data will be used to help conduct a
widespread review of the organisation\'s information systems.\
\
To help with this effort, the Cemiess Empire Party is offering a series
of incentives to pilots who deliver Exploration Data to Mackenzie Relay
until such time as targets have been met.
