The Kumo Crew syndicate is requesting deliveries to mass-produce a
recreational drug.\
\
The drug is believed to originate with the Blue Viper Club, a nomadic
clan travelling aboard an ancient dredger that recently appeared near
Kumo City station.\
\
Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, representing the Kumo Council, provided
details to local newsfeed The Pegasi Sentinel:\
\
\"Helix will change lives across the galaxy! Derived from high-quality
organic crops, and with many medicinal and psychological benefits, it is
guaranteed to bring contentment.\"\
\
She later called on all freedom-loving pilots to help protect this
initiative, and that they will be handsomely rewarded for their
efforts.\
\
Many authorities have registered concern that this will exacerbate drug
addiction and misuse, which are common social problems. However, some
markets have shown interest in the potential new product.\
\
Vox Galactica has reported rumours that it may be a previously unknown
strain of onionhead, a highly popular psychedelic. It remains unknown
whether the Blue Viper Club cultivated it aboard their dredger or
acquired it from another source.\
\
Experts predict that if enough commodities are provided, the product
will come to market around the 22nd of July 3307.\
\
To support this initiative, hand in your bounties to the Kumo Council at
Kumo City in the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system.\
\
The initiative begins on the 8th of July 3307 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met, the campaign will end immediately.
