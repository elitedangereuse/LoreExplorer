Supplies have been requested in the Leesti system to help improve the
infrastructure of the Alliance Defence Force.\
\
The initiative was outlined by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the representative
from the Sirius Navy who sits on the Council of Admirals:\
\
\"The shocking events in the HIP 22460 system have increased the need
for Allied systems to prepare stronger defences against the Thargoid
menace. Therefore, we have begun work to enhance the responsive
capabilities of the Alliance Defence Force.\"\
\
\"As a first step, Sirius Corporation will outfit new sentry megaships,
which will possess the experimental AX weapons that were deployed by the
Oath of Tyndareus. The more resources we can gather, the more megaships
we can prepare. These will then serve as operational hubs for anti-xeno
engagements within Allied space.\"\
\
\"The materials required are energy grid assemblies, magnetic emitter
coils, power transfer buses and titanium. Pilots who transport these to
the Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system will be rewarded for their
efforts.\"\
\
In related news, Sirius Corporation\'s megaship El Centinela Cadejo has
completed rescue efforts following the disaster in HIP 22460. Under
orders from Admiral Glass, it has returned to the Arimpox system from
where the survivors will be transported to their homes.\
\
The campaign will end on the 25th August 3308. If the final target is
met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
