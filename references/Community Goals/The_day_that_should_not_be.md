Having been labeled as a crackpot by most civilized space, tin foil hat
wearing conspiracy theorist Ricardo Bentonio has teamed up with Kruger
60 Free to fund a one day appeal for pilots to deliver cartographic data
that will help him prove his theories that according to ancient records
he claims to have unearthed show that the 29th Feburary 3302, which
appears on all galactic calendars, should not exist.\
\
Bentonio went into more details at a press conference claiming that the
entire human race would be wiped out if something is not done and had
this to say when questioned about his theory.\
\
\"We\'re not just talking about see ship systems failing and computer
system across the galaxy shutting down. We\'re talking about all life as
we know it stopping instantaneously, the very fabric of space time
collapsing in on itself and the universe as we know it coming to an end
in the blink of an eye.\"\
\
Pilots that want to contribute to the appeal are instructed to go to
Jones Estate in Groombridge 34 system and drop off any cartographic data
they have on the 29th February.\
