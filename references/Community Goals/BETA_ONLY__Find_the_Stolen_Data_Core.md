LHS 3262 Solutions has reported the theft of a valuable experimental
data core. The core, which has been in development for some time, has
been described as being "of great importance" to LHS 3262 Solutions, and
a generous reward has been offered for its safe return. The precise
location of the thieves is not known and Security services in the LHS
3262 system, where LHS 3262 Solutions is based, have been unable to
track the thieves, but they have determined that the criminals recently
visited three systems: Eleu, Pijan and Baris.\
\
LHS 3262 Solutions has stressed that the core must be recovered soon,
before it degrades and becomes unusable and are offering a rich reward
for the first pilot to return the item to their facility at Whitworth
Park on Akan.\
\
As an additional reward, the pilot that returns with the data core will
also be awarded a special code to obtain a new ship paint job of their
choice.
