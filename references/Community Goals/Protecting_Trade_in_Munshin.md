The Libertas Cooperative has announced plans to construct a manatee farm
on behalf of food supplier Munshin Manatee Meat. This will take the form
of a megaship, where the creatures will be bred, processed and prepared
for distribution.\
\
Progenitor Selena Conley of the Libertas Cooperative issued the
following statement:\
For years, the people of Munshin have been lucky enough to dine on the
finest meat in the galaxy. We are proud to be working in association
with Munshin Manatee Meat to help bring their product to a much wider
consumer base.\
To facilitate construction of the manatee farm, the Libertas Cooperative
has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those contributing material can do so safely.\
\
The campaign begins on the 13th of September 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Ocrinox\'s Orbiter in the Munshin system. Only
bounty vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.\
