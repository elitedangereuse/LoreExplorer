Further deliveries to Alcor and Colonia are required to add new
facilities to the Colonia Bridge starports.\
\
The Colonia Bridge project is currently halfway through its final phase,
which takes place over a four-week period. In the previous week, pilots
supplied large quantities of performance enhancers, personal weapons and
survival equipment.\
\
A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined the next stage:\
\
\"Thanks to the hard work of many independent pilots, we have
established a Pioneer Supplies outlet, a crew lounge and a search and
rescue contact at five starports along the travel corridor between the
core systems and the Colonia region.\"\
\
\"For week three, our aim is to continue constructing the stations by
installing a material trader, concourse bar and mission contract
services. These will rely on shipments of liquor, computer components
and water purifiers.\"\
\
\"For pilots who deliver these to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor
system, Brewer Corporation will be pleased to offer payment in credits,
along with a White Engine Drive Colour and a White Carrier Drive Colour
to the top 75% of contributors.\"\
\
Once this week\'s initiative concludes, week four will aim to complete
the Colonia Bridge starports with a full range of services.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to five starports branching out from Alcor, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Bartender\
Tier 2: Material Trader\
Tier 3: Mission Contracts\
\
Part three of the four-week campaign begins on the 24th of February 3308
and will run for one week.
