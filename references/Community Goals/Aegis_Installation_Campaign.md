Aegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the
Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.\
\
An Aegis spokesperson gave the following statement to the media:\
After the recent occupation of Socho by a hostile criminal element, it
is imperative that Aegis bolster its holdings in the Pleiades Sector
IR-W d1-55. The construction of a military installation will allow us to
continue our fight against the Thargoids unhindered by external forces.\
\
Aegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources, promising
to reward pilots who deliver these to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector
IR-W d1-55.
