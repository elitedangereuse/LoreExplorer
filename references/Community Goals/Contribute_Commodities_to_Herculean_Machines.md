The Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal
computers from manufacturer Herculean Machines.\
\
Maddox Hurd, the company\'s CEO, made this announcement:\
It\'s a testament to the Duradrive\'s reliability that the Federal Navy
wants to make it standard issue, and we are proud to supply them.\
\
Fulfilling this order on time requires additional materials, however, so
we urgently need deliveries of consumer technology, hardware diagnostic
sensors and computer components to Boltzmann Hub in the Blatrimpe
system.
