The Federation is offering bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Sosong
system.\
\
Commodore Morag Halloran, who coordinates Salvation\'s military forces,
broadcast this message on public channels:\
\
\"Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to
expunge the latest Thargoid infestation. He estimates two more weeks
before these devices become operational. Until that time, it is vital
that we keep the Thargoids at bay to minimise civilian casualties.\"\
\
The anti-xeno taskforce of the Federal Navy is part of a joint operation
to buy time for the superweapons to be completed. This includes
rewarding independent pilots for defending the Sosong system.\
\
Commanders can hand in combat bonds for Thargoid kills until the 12th of
May 3308 at Sturckow Orbital in the Lesheima system.\
\
Jade Sanderlyn, a reporter for Vox Galactica, has been granted
permission to interview the admirals in command of the taskforces. Her
conversation with Admiral Maxton Price is being broadcast by the
flagship FNS Amphion in Sosong and will be syndicated via newsfeeds.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th April and will run until the 12th May
3308.
