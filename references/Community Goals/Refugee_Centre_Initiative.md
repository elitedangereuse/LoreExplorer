Due to heightened military action in the core systems, Senator Caspian
Leopold has launched an initiative to construct a rehabilitation centre
for those affected by the ongoing conflict.\
\
A spokesperson for Senator Leopold gave the following statement to the
media: An escalation in hostilities from both Thargoid and human parties
has left a lot of innocent civilians without food or shelter. Senator
Leopold has heard their cries for help, and is building a sanctuary
where the safety of refugees can be guaranteed. The Niflhel Corp., which
is overseeing the initiative, has placed an open order for Cobalt,
Semiconductors and Synthetic Fabrics, promising to reward pilots who
deliver these commodities to Biruni Port in the Niflhel system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 14th of June 3304 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Cobalt, Semiconductors and Synthetic Fabrics to Biruni
Port in the Niflhel system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
