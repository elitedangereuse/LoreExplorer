In recognition of the well intended efforts of Aisling\'s Angels, the
Princess Lavigny-Duval has issued a request asking that all members of
her fleet position themselves to protect the Angels from pirates looking
to interfere wit their efforts.\
\
Imperial pilots willing to lend their combat prowess to the cause are
asked to patrol all local systems, not just Persephone, in order to
ensure that an adequate level of security coverage has been arranged to
properly protect traders and relief staff as they ship medicine
throughout the area.
