An open order for military supplies has been placed on behalf of the
Federal Navy by the League of Zearla. A spokesman for the organization
gave the following statement:\
\
\"The Federal Navy urgently requires shipments of Battle Weapons,
Landmines and Performance Enhancers to be delivered to the Payson Hub in
the Zearla system.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 3rd of January 3305 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for the rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Battle Weapons, Landmines and Performance Enhancers to
Payson Hub in the Zearla system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes and other disruptive events can
negatively impact markets and station services, and could prevent the
initiative from running smoothly.
