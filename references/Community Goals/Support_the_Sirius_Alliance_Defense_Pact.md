The Di Jian system is hosting competing campaigns as the Alliance
Assembly votes on the strategic defence pact.\
\
The Assembly is evenly split over formalising military ties with Sirius
Corporation to enhance defensive options against the Thargoids, with a
decision expected at the end of June. In advance of the vote, both
pro-pact and anti-Sirius councillors are attempting to sway colleagues
to their cause by securing a sizeable resource package for the Alliance
Defence Force.\
\
Pro-pact councillors have established their initiative in Di Jian from
the Sirius megaship Kumiho Sky, and are asking for shipments of computer
components, reinforced mounting plates and synthetic reagents. These
councillors have heavily promoted the need for enhanced fleet support in
the face of increasing Thargoid activity. Noted engineer Marco Qwent
recently confirmed his support for an Allied anti-xeno pact with
Sirius.\
\
To encourage support from pilots, Sirius Corporation is offering extra
incentives. The majority of contributors to the Kumiho Sky campaign will
receive a double-engineered AX fixed missile launcher, enhanced with
both High Capacity and Rapid Fire modifications, among other rewards.\
\
Top 75%: 2B Double Engineered AX Fixed Missile Launcher\
Sirius Permit\
Top 50%: Additional 2B Double Engineered AX Fixed Missile Launcher\
Access to Marco Qwent\'s Workshop\
Top 25%: 3A Double Engineered AX Fixed Missile Launcher\
Top 10%: Additional 3A Double Engineered AX Fixed Missile Launcher\
\
The campaign will run until the 23rd June 3308. If the final target is
met earlier than planned, or the opposing campaign is completed first,
the campaign will end immediately.
