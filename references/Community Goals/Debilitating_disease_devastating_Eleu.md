A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Eleu. So far
the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best efforts
of medical staff aboard Finney Dock.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Finney Dock, the Social Eleu Progressive
Party are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that provide
medicines to Finney Dock market until such time as the crisis has been
averted.
