Data deliveries are required by competing initiatives to increase or
decrease civilian surveillance in the Federation.\
\
President Zachary Hudson has asked the public to contribute to making
the Proactive Detection Bureau more effective:\
\
\"The PDB requires access to lesser-known comms channels where
terrorists and criminals lurk. Supplying it with data from multiple
sources will allow us to root out more potential threats.\"\
\
To counter this campaign, Shadow President Felicia Winters aims to
protect personal communications from being intercepted:\
\
\"My duty is to help citizens preserve their constitutional right to
privacy. If enough data can be gathered for baseline testing, we will
distribute legal technology and techniques to secure against government
intrusion.\"\
\
Both campaigns require deliveries of the following data types: unusual
encrypted files, specialised legacy firmware, exceptional scrambled
emission data and anomalous bulk scan data.\
\
To support President Hudson, pilots should deliver data to Gresley Dock
in the Nanomam system.\
\
Should the initiative gain more data than Shadow President Winters\'s
campaign, President Hudson will put in place measures to increase
security for systems he controlsÂ or exploits, boosting their security by
25%. Winters\'s failure is predicted to have negative consequences in
systems she controls or exploits, with a decrease of 50% in system
stability. These effects are expected to last for at least one month
before settling back toward existing values.\
\
Additionally, the top 75% of contributors will receive a fully
engineered A-rated Kill Warrant Scanner with fast scan and long range
modifications. This will be placed in storage at Gresley Dock by the 8th
of May 3307.\
\
The initiatives begin on the 29th of April 3307 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaigns
will end immediately.\
Should both initiatives be completed to the same tier, the one with the
highest contribution will be designated the victor.
