Information relayed to Princess Arissa indicates that criminals
operating in and around this sector may be able to provide information
as to who hired the Emperor\'s would-be-assassin.\
\
As such, all combat capable pilots of Nehet are requested to join the
Princess in her crusade against the insidious rot that hides within the
belly of our great nation.\
\
It is believed that the forceful ejection of the criminal elements will
result in furthering the investigation into the attack on the Emperor,
while also helping to improve the lives of those unfortunate enough to
be living in the shadow of organised crime.
