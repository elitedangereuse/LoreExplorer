Professor Ishmael Palin has issued a request for Meta-Alloys, which he
believes may be the key to eradicating the mysterious technological
issues currently affecting a number of starports. The Ant Hill Mob, on
behalf of Professor Palin, has promised to generously reward traders who
deliver Meta-Alloys to Obsidian orbital in the Maia system.\
