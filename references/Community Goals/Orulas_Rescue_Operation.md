For year, the sparsely populated Orulas system has been dominated by the
Orulas Blue Hand Gang, a ruthless criminal organization. This
cold-blooded band has been making life intolerable for the system\'s
inhabitants, but the local government appears reluctant to take a stand.
Rumours abound that the authorities receive regular kickbacks from the
criminals.\
\
But one resident has had enough. Rose Trebek, a former soldier and
veteran of countless military campaigns, has established a defence
initiative to clean up Orulas - the Joint Security Taskforce.\
\
\"I\'m sick of these scumbags running my system,\" said Trebek, \"and
I\'m sick of the government looking the other way. It\'s time to take
care of these punks. But we can\'t do it alone.\"\
\
\"Our intelligence indicates that the Blue Hand is ferrying its spoils
in big convoys to various fences. They trade mostly in escape pod, which
they sell to shady pseudo-scientific outfits conducting illegal human
experiments. We need pilots to swoop in, bust open the convoys, and
recover as many pods as they can. They should then take the pods to
Wilkes Orbital.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 25th of February 3302 and will run for one
week.\
pilots who support the operation will be generously reimbursed.\
