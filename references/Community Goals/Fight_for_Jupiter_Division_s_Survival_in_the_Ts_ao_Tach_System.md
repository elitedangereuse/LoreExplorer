Jupiter Division is fighting for survival against the Silver Legal Group
in the Ts\'ao Tach system.\
\
Jupiter Division was formed by rogue Core Dynamics departments loyal to
ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester. Although it was defeated in February, a
growing corporatist movement within the Federation has helped rebuild
its strength.\
\
Vice-Executive Blanca Carbonell, a senior leader of Jupiter Division,
broadcast this [message:\\\\](message:\\)\
\"To all those seeking a better Federation -- stand up and make your
voice heard! Only direct corporate rule can end government corruption.
Jupiter Division must survive to lead that change!\"\
\
Two megaships, Victory\'s Forge and Iron Wings of Justice, are once
again serving as the centres of operation for Jupiter Division and the
Silver Legal Group.\
\
Political commentators believe that this second conflict will be a
decisive one, determining whether or not Jupiter Division can survive
without its founder.\
\
Jupiter Division has offered credit rewards to any pilots willing to
help secure its existence by handing in Combat Bonds at the megaship
Victory\'s Forge.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached or early on Thursday the 10th of June 3307.
