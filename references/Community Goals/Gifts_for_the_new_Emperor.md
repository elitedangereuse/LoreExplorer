Arissa Lavigny-Duval has issued a request for Slaves to mark her
forthcoming coronation. The Slaves, which the future Emperor has
described as \"coronation gifts\", are to be delivered to Dawes Hub in
the Achenar System. In exchange, pilots will be offered discounts on
Imperial ships, and granted access to vessels that would ordinarily
require a rank in the Imperial Navy. The permit restrictions on Achenar
have been temporarily lifted to allow pilots to deliver gifts to the
future Emperor.\
