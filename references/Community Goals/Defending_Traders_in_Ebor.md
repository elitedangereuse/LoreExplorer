Cobra Wing, an independent organisation based in Ebor, has launched an
initiative to build a new research outpost in the system.\
\
The outpost will support further research into the Thargoids, focusing
specifically on the possibility of inter-species communication.\
\
A spokesperson for Cobra Wing gave the following statement:\
Without communication, there can be no understanding. Without
understanding, there can be no peace. We ask the galactic community to
support this campaign, which will support new research into the
Thargoids and their methods of communication.\
Cobra Wing has placed a kill order on ships on its wanted list to allow
pilots delivering construction materials to do so safely. They have
promised to reward pilots who hand in bounty vouchers at Morrison
Enterprise in the Ebor system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 12th July 3304 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Morris Enterprise in the Ebor system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, Thargoid Sensor-related
interference and other disruptive events can negatively impact markets
and station services, and could prevent the initiative from running
smoothly.
