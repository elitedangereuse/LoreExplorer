The Blue Transport Exchange is pleased to announce that Dohkwithi A 1
has now entered the third stage of its terraforming process. Technicians
working for Big G Corporation are currently in the process of preparing
the necessary equipment in order to launch the next stage.\
\
Unfortunately due to lack of Atmospheric Processors, the project has
been temporarily delayed until such time as an adequate supply of
Atmospheric Processors can be obtained.\
\
In order to get the project back on schedule, the Blue Transport
Exchange are offering a range of rewards to pilots who help ship
Atmospheric Processors to the technicians aboard Ron Hubbard Dock before
the project enters stage 3.
