As the Colonia community continues to grow, the Junkyard Dogs have
placed an open order for various commodities to support another wave of
expansion.\
\
To support this operation, the Junkyard Dogs have also placed a kill
order on any wanted ships operating in their jurisdiction and promised
to reward pilots who hand in bounty vouchers at Tolagarf\'s Junkyard.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd June 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Tolgarf\'s Junkyard in the EOL Prou
Lw-L C8-215 system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
