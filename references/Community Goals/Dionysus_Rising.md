A relatively unknown democracy named Sirius Inc has announced plans to
construct a flight-operations megaship in the 42 n Persei system, which
occupies a strategic location on the route to Maia. The vessel-
tentatively named the Dionysus - will dramatically improve services in
42 n Persei, and allow docking by a wider variety of ships.\
\
Senior Aide Humberto Guthrie, speaking on behalf of Sirius Inc, released
the following statement:\
\
\"We are disturbed by recent events in the Pleiades and the
vulnerability of our systems. The superpowers cannot protect us, but we
intend to protect ourselves.\"\
\
Sirius Inc has therefore placed an open order for quantities of indium,
computer components, auto-fabricators and liquor, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver these goods to Green Enterprise in the Ngalia
system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of January 3304 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Indium, Computer Components, Auto-fabricators and
Liquor to Green Enterprise in the Ngalia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
