Commodities are requested to create new settlements for Marlinist
refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation.\
\
Sirius Corporation has offered to resolve the current standoff between
superpowers by establishing colonies where the refugees can live
independently.\
\
Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, summarised his proposal:\
\
\"It is clear that the Marlinists cannot return to the Empire, and are a
destabilising presence within the Federation. We offer an alternative by
constructing permanent habitats for their population. These will be
self-governed and may freely trade with the galactic community.\"\
\
\"Sirius cannot stand by while the risk of interstellar war increases. I
sincerely hope this leads to a more stable and profitable period for us
all.\"\
\
Traders are asked to deliver Atmospheric Processors, Auto-Fabricators,
Structural Regulators and Water Purifiers to Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05
1146 system. From there, the Omega Merchant Command will distribute
resources for the colonisation of up to ten uninhabited systems which
will be ready in early 3307.\
\
Each completed tier will provide the resources to populate two systems,
listed in order of priority:\
\
HIP 22550 and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6.\
LP 659-31 and Hyades Sector LX-T c3-30.\
Hyades Sector SU-C a14-1 and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2.\
Hyades Sector VP-N b7-4 and Hyades Sector AB-M b8-2.\
Hyades Sector YA-M b8-1 and Hyades Sector TJ-P b6-6.\
\
The initiative begins on the 10th of December 3306 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
