If you\'\'ve come this far commander, maybe you\'re willing to go a
little further down the rabbit hole. Powers should be afraid of their
people not the other way around. We are the form following the function.
We are those that question the galaxies powers of government. We are
here to remind the powers of the idea of listening to the people. Bring
us what we need so that our message does not go unheard and shall never
be forgotten.\
\
We will plant this idea as a seed that will grow. With enough people our
idea will change the galaxy.\
