The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group
have declared war in the Mudhrid system.\
\
The Steel Majesty megaship is serving as the base of the Neo-Marlinist
forces. These include many surviving NMLA terrorist cells that gathered
to overtake the vessel from the Marlinist Colonies.\
\
Also in the system is the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct, where the
NMLA\'s de facto leader Theta Seven and the remnants of Theta Group have
been in hiding for months. They recently took control of the vessel and
are holding thousands of cultists hostage.\
\
The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group is orchestrating its campaign from
Payne-Scott City starport. Senator Denton Patreus has requested that
Imperial auxiliaries provide the faction with combat support.\
\
ACT\'s co-leader Captain Saskia Landau stated:\
\
\"The NMLA clearly places huge value on Theta Seven\'s ability to
produce caustic enzyme weapons, and has risked concentrating in large
numbers to defend him. If he can transfer to the Steel Majesty and
escape, the threat of further atrocities like the Nine Martyrs bombings
will remain high.\"\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end when
the top tier is reached by either faction or early on Thursday the 2nd
of December 3307.
