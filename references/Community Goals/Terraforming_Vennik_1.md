For decades, the Revolutionary Party of Vennik has been terraforming the
planet Vennik 1, slowly transforming it into a habitable world. With the
ambitious project about to enter its final stage, the organisation has
placed an open order for terrain-enrichment systems with which to
prepare the planet\'s surface for agricultural development.\
\
A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Party of Vennik released a brief
statement:\
\
\"Terraforming a planet takes decades, so we\'re delighted to be
entering the final stage. Our aim is to establish an agricultural
economy on Vennik 1 so it can contribute to the production of food and
medicine in the Vennik system. With the support of the galactic
community, we will soon be able to reap the benefit of our efforts.\"\
\
The organisation has promised to reward those who deliver the
much-needed commodities to Nixon Enterprise in the Vennik system. The
campaign begins on the 17th of March 3302 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
