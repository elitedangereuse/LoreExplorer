The Imperial Navy has discovered bases belonging to the seditious group
Emperor\'s Dawn in the Maausk and Dakshmandi systems, and Senator Denton
Patreus is mounting an operation to destroy these insurgents. Imperial
intelligence currently believes that Emperor\'s Dawn was responsible for
the assassination of Emperor Hengist Duval, and it has made the
eradication of this insurrectionist organisation a priority.\
\
The Dakshmandi Focus has been authorised to reward pilots who help to
remove Emperor\'s Dawn from these systems.
