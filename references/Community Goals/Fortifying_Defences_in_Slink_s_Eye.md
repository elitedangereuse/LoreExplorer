Security forces in the Slink\'s Eye system have reported a dramatic
upswing in pirate activity. Reports indicate that the agitators are
attacking civilians, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\
In response to this development, the Revolutionary Slink\'s Eye Liberals
has placed an open order for Reactive Armour, and has promised to reward
pilots who deliver the much-needed commodity to Kelleam Ring for local
security forces.\
The campaign begins on the 6th of October 3302 and will run for one
week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Reactive Armour to Kelleam Ring in the Slink\'s Eye
system.\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
Please be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
