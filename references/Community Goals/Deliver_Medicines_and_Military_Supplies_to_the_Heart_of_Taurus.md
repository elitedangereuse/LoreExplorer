Medical and military commodities are needed to support the
cross-superpower operation in the HIP 22460 system.\
\
Commodore Morag Halloran, who is coordinating for Azimuth Biotech aboard
the Bright Sentinel megaship, outlined the requirements:\
\
\"The Proteus Wave is designed to attract the bulk of the Thargoid fleet
before destroying them. We are making preparations to defend Salvation
from the alien vessels until the superweapon is ready.\"\
\
\"Azimuth Biotech is offering generous payment for shipments of advanced
medicines, basic medicines and reactive armour. These can be delivered
to the Heart of Taurus megaship in HIP 22460.\"\
\
\"Specially tailored ship liveries are available as additional rewards,
in gratitude to those loyal Commanders who are dedicated to Salvation\'s
cause of defeating the Thargoids.\"\
\
The anti-xeno taskforces of the Alliance, Empire and Federation are also
preparing to engage Thargoid forces in and around HIP 22460. Capital
ships have been running combat drills and practising naval manoeuvres.
As yet, there is no indication when the anticipated Thargoid fleet may
arrive.\
\
The top 75% of contributors will receive an Azimuth Rebellion paintjob
for the Krait Mk II, Eagle and Fer-de-Lance\
\
The campaign begins on the 30th June and will run for one week. If the
final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
