Brewer Corporation intends to improve the travel corridor between the
Alcor and Colonia systems by constructing several new starports.\
\
The previous two phases of the Colonia Bridge project established
stationary megaships in 56 systems. These provide rest, refuel and
repair facilities for vessels making the 22,000 light year journey to
and from the Colonia region.\
\
A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined this latest
initiative:\
\
\"Phase three aims to enhance the Colonia Bridge by building permanent
starports in key locations along the route. These will offer a wide
range of services to travellers, and also serve as homes for the many
new communities that we expect to spring up around them.\"\
\
\"Our plan is to construct up to five starports branching out from
Alcor. Starport structures will be assembled by the 27th of January,
with additional services scheduled for implementation at a later
date.\"\
\
\"Pilots are asked to deliver ceramic composites, computer components
and thermal cooling units to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor
system.\"\
\
\"Should deliveries reach sufficient levels, the top 75% of contributors
will be awarded an engineered frame shift drive with increased range and
faster boot sequence. These will be placed in storage at Macdonald
Settlement.\"\
\
The top five contributors in Alcor will be invited to submit naming
suggestions for the new starports. All name submissions will be subject
to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to add the following to
the Colonia Bridge route. Module rewards are also decided by the final
tier achieved.\
\
Tier 1: One starport framework assembled\
Tier 2: One additional starport framework\
Tier 3: One additional starport framework and Modified 3A Frame Shift
Drive\
Tier 4: One additional starport framework and Modified 4A Frame Shift
Drive\
Tier 5: One additional starport framework and Modified 6A Frame Shift
Drive\
Tier 6: All additional commodities delivered will count toward personal
contribution totals\
\
Rewards tiers are cumulative, and higher tiers will include rewards from
lower tiers.\
\
The campaign begins on the 6th of January 3308 and will run for one
week.
