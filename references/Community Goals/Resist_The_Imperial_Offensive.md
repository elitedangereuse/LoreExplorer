The Empire has despatched a large military fleet to the Cayutorme system
to engage the mercenary group known as the Cayutorme Syndicate. The
organisation claims the Empire is trying to curtail its independence by
forcing its members into Imperial citizenship, and has issued a call for
aid, pledging to reward any pilots who help them to resist the Imperial
offensive.\
