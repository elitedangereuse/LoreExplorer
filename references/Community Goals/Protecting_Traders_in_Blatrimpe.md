The Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal
computers from manufacturer Herculean Machines. To fulfil the request,
Herculean has placed an open order for various commodities, in addition
to organising a combat mission to protect those contributing to the
initiative.\
\
Maddox Hurd, the company\'s CEO, made this announcement:\
The campaign is being coordinated by our partner, Blatrimpe Allied Co
Commodities, which has placed a kill order on all wanted ships to keep
traders safe. I haven\'t ruled out the possibility that our rivals might
recruit agitators to disrupt this operation -- who knows what Scorpio
DeVorrow is up to these days?
