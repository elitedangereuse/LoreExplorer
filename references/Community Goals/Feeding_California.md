The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has announced plans to establish
an agricultural facility in the Synuefai LX-R d5-28 system, with the aim
of supporting the Alliance and Turner Research Group outposts in the
California Nebula.\
\
To support this goal, the organisation has asked the galactic community
to deliver Land Enrichment Systems, Crop Harvesters and Auto Fabricators
to Hansford\'s Landing in the BD+22 4939 system. Commanders who support
the campaign will be generously compensated.\
\
Saool Aledon, a senior operative in the Spinward Marches, released the
following statement:\
We are well aware of the challenges involved in supporting outposts far
from the core systems. We want to leverage our expertise to support the
Alliance\'s operations in the California Nebula, and we hope we have the
support of the galactic community.
