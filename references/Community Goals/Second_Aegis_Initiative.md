Last week, Aegis started developing weapons and technologies to address
the rising Thargoid threat. While some were dismayed to see Aegis shift
to a military focus, the general consensus was that the move was
necessary.\
\
Following news that Aegis is to embark on a second development
initiative, Aegis\' military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner released the
following statement:\
\
\"The Thargoids represent a very real threat, and their hostility
demands that we take appropriate action. As with our previous
initiative, our intention is to collaborate with some of the galaxy\'s
foremost engineers to develop efficient anti-Thargoid technologies.\"\
\
In support of this aim, Aegis\'s corporate partners Wolf 397
Independents have pledged to reward pilots who deliver tantalum,
Thargoid Cyclops tissue samples and CMM Composites to Chelbin Service
Station in the Wolf 397 system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 28th of September and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
