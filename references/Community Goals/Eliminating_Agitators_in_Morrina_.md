Barjavel Vision, Morrina - Hand in bounty vouchers at Barjavel Vision in
the Morrina system to help tackle criminal activity in the system.\
\
Recent reports from Morrina indicate that the system is in the grip of
widespread civil unrest. The system\'s inhabitants have taken to the
streets to express their displeasure with local authorities, which have
been criticised for failing to tackle rampant criminal activity. In
response to this development, the Morrina Pro-Alliance Party has placed
a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver Bounty Vouchers to Barjavel
Vision.\
