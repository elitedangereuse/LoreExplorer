Aegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the
Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.\
\
An Aegis spokesperson gave the following statement to the media:\
After the recent occupation of Socho by a hostile criminal element, it
is imperative that Aegis bolster its holdings in the Pleiades Sector
IR-W d1-55. The construction of a military installation will allow us to
continue our fight against the Thargoids unhindered by external forces.\
\
Aegis Research has placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list
to protect those delivering construction materials. They have promised
to reward pilots who hand in Bounty Vouchers at The Oracle in the
Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.
