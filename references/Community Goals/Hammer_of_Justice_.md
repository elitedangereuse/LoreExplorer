Chancellor Arias also called on the Pilots Federation to support
Sovereign Justice Collective forces by protecting traders delivering
titanium to Greeboski\'s Outpost. Pilots who hand in bounty vouchers or
deliver titanium to the starport will be generously rewarded.\
\
By inviting pilots from all over the galaxy we will no doubt bring
together many honourable commanders in this endeavour, but make no
mistake that with good comes evil and we must prepare for the criminal
opportunists who will most assuredly show up. There are hunters and
there are victims. By your discipline, cunning, obedience and alertness,
you will decide if you are a hunter or a victim." Chancellor Zahra
