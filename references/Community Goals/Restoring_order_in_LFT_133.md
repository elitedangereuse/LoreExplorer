Authorities in the LFT 133 system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
To counter this threat the AEF Legion of LFT 133 has placed a kill order
on all wanted ships operating in the LFT 133 syste, and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver Bounty Vouchers to Sullivan Dock.\
\
The campaign begins on the 1st of September 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Sullivan Dock in the LFT 133
system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Please be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
