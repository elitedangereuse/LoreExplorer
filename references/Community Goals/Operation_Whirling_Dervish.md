The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has embarked on a campaign to
establish a new Coriolis starport in the Ogmar system. The campaign --
dubbed Operation Whirling Dervish -- is designed to support further
expansion in the Colonia region.\
\
Lou Brady, a spokesperson for the organisation, released the following
statement:\
\
\"The new starport will be able to accommodate more people, produce
high-tech goods, and service larger vessels, making it an ideal platform
for future activity in Colonia.\"\
\
The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has placed an open order for
atmospheric processors, CMM composites, indium, tantalum and thermal
cooling units, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these
commodities to Dervish Platform in the Ogmar system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 14th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.
