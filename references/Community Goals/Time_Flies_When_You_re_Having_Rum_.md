The Harma Silver Cartel has announced that it intends to bring back a
beverage that has been lost for several hundred years: rum.\
\
Reports indicate that the organisation recently discovered a time
capsule from the 24th century containing a recipe for the drink, as well
as the log of one Captain Smolenski. Although the Cartel is keeping the
recipe secret, it has placed an open order for a range of rare alcohols
that will be used to create the new beverage.\
\
The Cartel has promised to reward those who deliver the requested
commodities to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. The organisation
has also promised to bring the drink to the market under the name Harma
Silver Sea Rum, assuming the campaign is successful.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:\
\
"We will create the finest rum since the days of piracy on the seas of
Earth. After all, a pirate isn\'t a pirate without rum!"\
\
The initiative begins on 27th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before
delivering Bast Snake Gin, Kongga Ale, Lavian Brandy, Wuthielo Ku Froth
and Orrerian Vicious Brew to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
