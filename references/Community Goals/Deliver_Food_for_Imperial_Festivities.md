Imperial senator Simone Leatrix has announced plans for a week of
revelry at her palatial residence on Capitol in the Achenar system.\
\
The senator told the media:\
We Imperials value the finer things, even during times of political
upset. So I intend to celebrate the end of the year with a sumptuous
party at my mountaintop retreat, which will be specially renovated for
the occasion.\
\
To feed the hundreds of high-profile guests, Senator Leatrix has asked
the Cemiess Imperial Society to organise food deliveries to Cemiess.
