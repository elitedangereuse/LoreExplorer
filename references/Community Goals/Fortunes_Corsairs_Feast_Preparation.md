The Fortunes Corsairs faction has organised an initiative to transport
food commodities to the Chamas system.​\
​\
A fundraising event has been organised as part of efforts to greenlight
the construction of a new asteroid base. Many of the system\'s elected
officials are expected to attend the grand feast, prepared by the most
eminent chefs in Chamas.​\

Silas James, representing the Chamash Foods conglomerate, announced:​\
\
\"We feel that nothing but the finest foodstuffs from the Inner Orion
Spur should be on hand for this momentous occasion. Couriers are invited
to play their part in helping the region towards an era of
prosperity.\"\
\
A request has been made for independent traders to deliver fruit and
vegetables, fish, grain and synthetic meat to Denton Dock in the Chamas
system. ​\
