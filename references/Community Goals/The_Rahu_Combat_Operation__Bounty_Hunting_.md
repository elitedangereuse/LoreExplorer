An Alliance spokesperson has announced that a Naval convoy has been
attacked in the Rahu system. The spokesperson also confirmed that
criminals have begun targeting the convoy with the intention of taking
escape pods from the wreckage.\
\
\"These criminals have just one aim: to abduct Aliance personnel and
sell them into illegal slavery. We cannot allow these vile opportunists
to take our comrades captive.\"\
\
\"We have therefore placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in
the system, to support those attempting to rescue escape pods from the
wreckage.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 23rd February 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Acharya Station in the Rahu system. Only Bounty
Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
