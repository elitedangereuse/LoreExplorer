The party to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Distant Worlds
Expedition has been a tremendous success, with festivities at Skvortsov
Orbital lasting for several days. But the revelry has come at a cost, as
it seems 63 G. Capricorni is now in the grip of a system-wide hangover.\
\
A member of staff at Skvortsov Orbital said: \"Those Diamond Frogs
really know how to throw a party. Seriously, I\'ve never seen anything
like it. At one point, the security chief was dancing on a table and
screaming about wanting to be a showgirl.\"\
\
The starport\'s chief of security declined to comment, although rumours
that he has resigned his position to fulfil his secret ambitions remain
unsubstantiated. His office issued the following statement:\
\
\"The celebrations were a great success, but now it\'s time to clean up.
We are therefore asking independent pilots to deliver hazardous
environment suits, water purifiers and coffee to help the system get
back on its feet.\"\
\
The Diamond Frogs have once again stepped in, promising to reward pilots
who deliver the much-needed commodities to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63

1.  Capricorni system. The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and

will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned,
the campaign will end immediately.\
