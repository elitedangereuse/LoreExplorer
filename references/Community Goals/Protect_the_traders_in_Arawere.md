Following its request for Onionhead, the Arawere Empire League is in
need of experienced combat pilots to eliminate the agitators operating
in the system, and protect those delivering Onionhead. Any combat pilots
who contribute to this initiative by eliminating agitators in Arawere
will be generously rewarded.\

Suggest lasers.\
