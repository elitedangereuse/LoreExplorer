Traders are required in the Upaniklis system to assist the Golconda in
resuming its voyage.\
\
The ancient generation ship, which originated from Earth in the 22nd
century, has been retrofitted by the Artificers Clan into a functional
modern vessel. The majority of its former population have decided to
leave the outpost Forester\'s Choice and return to their traditional
nomadic lifestyle.\
\
Captain Jonathon Forester, leader of the Golconda Union, announced:\
\
\"In 3305 the galactic community provided us with the chance to end our
original journey, so it will be fitting if they can help us start a new
chapter among the stars. The Golconda now has a frame shift drive that
requires tritium fuel, and shipments of medical diagnostic equipment and
power generators are also needed.\"\
\
Upaniklis Vision Incorporated has agreed to organise the initiative.
Pilots are asked to deliver all commodities to Fozard Port, from where
they will be transferred aboard the Golconda.\
\
According to the Federal Diplomatic Corp, these events do not violate
the legislation that protects isolated societies from cultural
contamination. It added: \"Partnership status with the Federation has
been extended to the Golconda and continues to apply to Forester\'s
Choice outpost.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 2nd of June 3308 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
