In the face of an overwhelming wave of Federal oppression, the Crimson
State Group faces what must be its darkest hour.\
\
Hundreds of thousands have given their lives to liberate Lugh from the
Federation, and yet every day the Sons of Conn find themselves losing
more and more ground.\
\
To turn the tide of this war, Ã‰amonn has authorised additional funding
to be used in the procurement of more weapons for the Crimson State
Group. If enough weapons are obtained, it could just be possible for the
Sons of Conn to hold the line long enough for CSG operatives to complete
their work aboard Hartsfield Market.
