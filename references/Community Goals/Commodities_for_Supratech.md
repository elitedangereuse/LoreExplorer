Billionaire investor Lexi October has announced plans to save technology
company Supratech from bankruptcy:\
\
"Although Supratech\'s Torc design proved to be impractical, I feel that
a company with such imagination and expertise deserves another chance to
succeed. So I have decided to fund a commodity drive to get Supratech
back on its feet."\
\
"I have invited the People\'s Rakapila Progressive Party to organise
shipments of Computer components, auto-fabricators and hardware
diagnostic sensors, which will enable Supratech to resume its innovative
work."\
\
Deliveries should be made to Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system. To
protect traders, the People\'s Rakapila Progressive Party has placed a
kill order on all wanted ships in the system.
