The Federation has launched an initiative to develop autonomous military
hardware with which to fight the Thargoids.\
\
The operation has received financial support from the Momoirent Central
and Co, which has placed an open order for various commodities for use
in the campaign. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all
ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing to the campaign
can do so in safety.
