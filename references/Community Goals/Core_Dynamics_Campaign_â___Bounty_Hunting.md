Core Dynamics, one of the galaxy\'s largest starship manufacturers, has
announced a new construction initiative in response to the rise in
Thargoid attacks.\
\
A spokesperson for Core Dynamics released the following statement:\
\
The number of ships lost to Thargoid attacks is increasing rapidly,
leaving us with no option but to accelerate our production schedule. But
we cannot do this without the support of the galactic community.\
\
The Guaras Blue Creative Partners has placed an open order for various
construction materials, and has placed a kill order on all ships on its
wanted list, to ensure that those delivering goods to Klimuk Ring can do
so safely.\
\
Pilots who support the initiative will be offered a discount on all
Federal ships, and will also enjoy a temporary lift on rank requirements
for Federal vessels.\
\
The campaign begins on the 21st of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system. Only bounty
vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your personal
contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
