Transmission \*\*\
\
Eager to prove their worth to the Pirate King, the Camorra of Krisha
recently launched a bloody campaign to establish themselves as the
legitimate rulers of the Krisha region.\
\
Fighting around Fincke Depot has proven to be fierce, but so far, Krisha
Systems have managed to maintain control over the station.\
\
In return for helping the Camorra of Krisha capture Fincke Depot, the
Camorra Capos are willing to offer a significant number of credits to
any hardworking combat orientated operatives that help the Camorra\'s
establish their dominance in the system.
