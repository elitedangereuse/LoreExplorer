Open warfare has begun in the Paresa system between Nova Imperium and
the League of Mandu, a Federal faction.\
\
Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has been accused of masterminding the
NMLA starport bombings, according to evidence provided to ACT.\
\
Admiral Natalia Lee, commanding the Harmony\'s Shield megaship,
declared:\
\
\"The Empire refuses to arrest a Duval, even when he and his
organisation are brutal terrorists. In the name of the hundreds of
thousands of Federal citizens they murdered, we will enact justice.\"\
\
Hadrian Duval made an announcement from Dyson City, the home station of
Nova Imperium:\
\
\"This invasion of Imperial space is based on false information. The
Federation does not have the right to act as our judge, jury and
executioner. I call upon the Empire to come to our defence, as
stipulated in the Treaty of Paresa.\"\
\
Nova Imperium is an isolationist group that believes in retaining
Imperial traditions and severing all ties with other superpowers.
Hadrian Duval is the illegitimate grandson of Emperor Hengist, whose
heritage was officially acknowledged last November.\
\
ACT is currently working to verify claims that the Neo-Marlinist Order
of Mudhrid aided the NMLA on Imperator Duval\'s instructions.\
\
The League of Mandu has asked Federal auxiliaries to support its efforts
by handing in Combat Bonds at the Harmony\'s Shield megaship in the
Paresa system.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 13th of May 3307.
