The Empire has announced plans to construct an outpost in the Andhrimi
system, and has placed an open order for materials for use in the
construction. After learning of the Empire\'s plans to gain a foothold
in the Andhrimi system, the Federation intends to undermine the
operation by targeting Alectrona Imperial Society ships.\
\
The campaign begins on the 16th of March 3303 and will run for one week.
If either organisation achieves its aims earlier than planned, the
operations will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Yurchikhin Station in the Andhrimi
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
