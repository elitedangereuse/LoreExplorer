The Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces have announced plans to fortify their
home system of Sitakapa by converting a mining outpost into a military
settlement. The move is a response to increasing political and military
instability across the galaxy.\
\
General Ani Leonard of Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces announced:\
\
\"Our galaxy becomes more dangerous every day. Whether it\'s the
Federation sowing unrest in the Pleiades, fringe-terrorism from Salom√®
and her lackeys or hyperdictions from unknown parties, the risks are
greater than they\'ve ever been. And the frontier colonies are most at
risk. We must be prepared.\"\
\
General Leonard promised that contractors who deliver military-grade
weapons and chemicals to Russell Hub will earn a cut of Sitakapa\'s
booming wealth -- the result of years of economic development.\
\
The campaign begins on the 27th of April 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Battle Weapons, Personal Weapons, Nerve Agents,
Pesticides and Hydrogen Fuel to Russell Hub in the Sitikapa system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
