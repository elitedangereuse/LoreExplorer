\*\*Update May 3rd, 3303: The Cartoq Purple Major Organisation has
confirmed that the agitators operating in the Cartoq system have been
neautralized. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect
their rewards from Adveyev Settlement in the Cartoq system.\*\*\
\
Authorities in the Cartoq system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
\
To counter this threat, the Cartoq Purple Major Organisation has placed
a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Cartoq system, and has
promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Avdeyev
Settlement.\
\
The campaign begins on 27th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Avdeyev Settlement in the Cartoq
system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
