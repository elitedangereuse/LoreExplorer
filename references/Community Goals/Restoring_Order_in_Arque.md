Authorities in the Arque system have reported a sharp increase in the
number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the
agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting
trade and generally causing discord.\
To counter this threat, Arque Commodities has placed a kill order on all
wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots
who deliver bounty vouchers to Austen Town Station.\
The campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before turning bounties in to Austen Town Station in the Arque system.\
The campaign is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target
is met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
