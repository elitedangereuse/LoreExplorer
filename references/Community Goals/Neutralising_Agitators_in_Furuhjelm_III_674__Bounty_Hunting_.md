The Alliance has announced plans to construct a planetary outpost in the
California Nebula, and has placed an open order for materials for use in
the construction.\
\
To ensure those contributing materials can do so safely, 160 SOAR has
placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Furuhjelm
III-674 system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty
vouchers to Tshang City.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of December 3302 and will run for two
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Bounty Vouchers at Tshang City in the Furuhjelm
III-674 system.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
