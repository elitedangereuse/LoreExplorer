Last month, Professor Ishmael Palin announced his intention to retire
from The Palin Institute, the research organisation he founded in 3301.
In a statement, the professor indicated that he would relocate to a
small research centre on Maia A 3 a, where he would continue
investigating the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys. Now, the professor
has issued a further statement, announcing that he has placed an open
order for building fabricators for the construction of the new outpost.\
"The galactic community has given me considerable support over the past
few months -- even going so far as to rescue me and my team from pirates
in the Orulas system -- and I would very much like for them to be part
of this initiative. The new research centre will be relatively modest,
but there is still a need for materials. I can promise that pilots who
deliver the necessary supplies will be generously compensated!"\
The Defence Party of Nespeleve, which is coordinating the effort on
behalf of Professor Palin, has promised to reward pilots who deliver
building fabricators to Wilkes Orbital in the Nespeleve system. The
organisation has also promised to reward Commanders who eliminate
hostiles operating in the system, to ensure those delivering building
fabricators can do so safely.\
The campaign begins on the 12th of May 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
