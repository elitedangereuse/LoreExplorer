Following a series of hostile engagements in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96
system, recently established as a hub of Guardian technological
research, both Zende Partners and Segnen Exchange have appealed for
support.​\
​\
Cedrik Stone, CEO of Segnen Exchange, provided this statement:​\
\
\"Zende Partners apparently intends to control the trade of Guardian
commodities in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, which is perhaps why there is
violent resistance to their operation. My company would only ever
respond to threats with an appropriate level of self-defence.​\
\
In order to reestablish peace and protect our research into new
Guardian-human technology, we ask independent pilots to support Segnen
Exchange vessels in the system. Securing a permanent presence will allow
my company to complete work on an Advanced Dumbfire Launcher on
schedule.\
\
Our newly established outpost, Indigo Dock, will serve as our base of
operations in these efforts.\"\
\
​\
The two factions have set out campaigns in Synuefe EN-H d11-96, to take
place between the 23rd and 29th of May 3305.​\
