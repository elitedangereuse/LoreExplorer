The Colonia Nebula is a relatively innocuous region of space
encompassing the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. It is also likely to become
a major bastion of humanity in the years to come.\
\
Public interest in the Colonia Nebula was Piqued by the arrival in Eol
Prou RS-T d3-94 of Jaques Station, which dropped into the system after
making an unsuccessful attempt to jump to Beagle Point. In the weeks
that followed, pilots started ferrying goods to Jaques Station to repair
the damaged starport - an initiative that captured the imagination of
the galactic community. The region soon become a focus for those who
feared that a war between the Federation and the Empire may be looming,
and who hoped to escape it.\
\
A coordinated campaign to establish a permanent outpost in the region,
organised by the 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction, is already underway, and a
second is about to begin. The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 has announced plans to
establish an outpost in the Colonia Nebula, and has placed an open order
for materials for use in the construction.\
\
A spokesperson for the organisation said:\
\
\"A new beginning. A new tomorrow. That\'s what the Colonia Nebula
represents. A chance to create an interstellar community free from the
internecine conflicts that blight so much of inhabited space. with your
help, we can make it happen\"\
\
The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 has promised to reward pilots who deliver Titanium,
Semiconductors or Robotics to Jaques station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94
system. The campaign begins on the 18th of august 3302 and will run for
2 weeks.\
