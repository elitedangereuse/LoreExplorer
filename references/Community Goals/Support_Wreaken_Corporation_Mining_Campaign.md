Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have requested
deliveries of mined resources to the LTT 198 system.\
\
LTT 198 State Ltd, its controlling faction, will only allow one of the
rival corporations to remain permanently. The company with the most
successful campaign will establish a new starport in the
permit-controlled system, which is scheduled to enter operation on the
2nd of September 3307.\
\
Emmerich Koenig, CEO of Wreaken Construction, outlined his company\'s
initiative:\
\
\"We will pay handsomely for deliveries of coltan, gallite, praseodymium
and silver to the megaship Tobias\'s Gift in the LTT 198 system.\"\
\
LTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives
with temporary system permits lasting one week.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 10% of participants will receive a fully
engineered class 1 rating D abrasion blaster with long range. The module
will be placed in storage at Tobias\'s Gift in EGM 559 by Friday the
27th of August 3307.\
\
Should Wreaken Construction be victorious the top 75% of participants
will receive the module along with permanent permit access to LTT 198.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day campaigns, which will end early
on Thursday the 26th of August 3307. If one faction meets its objectives
earlier than planned, the initiatives will end immediately.
