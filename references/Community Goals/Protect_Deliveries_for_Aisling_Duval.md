A fundraiser hosted by Princess Aisling aims to finance a support
network for Imperial citizens affected by Thargoid aggression.\
\
The Citizens\' Relief Trust has been established in the Cemiess system,
prompted by the loss of thousands of military personnel during the
Battle of HIP 22460. She announced:\
\
\"While the Empire is focused on increasing its military strength, we
must not forget the human cost of ongoing conflict with the Thargoids.
Those who died in battle will be honoured by assisting the families and
dependants left to mourn them. The Citizens\' Relief Trust plans to
establish support centres to ensure their financial and emotional needs
are met.\"\
\
\"To raise funding, I have requested deliveries of luxury commodities to
be auctioned or sold at a special gala I plan to host for Imperial
nobility, with all proceeds used to establish this network.\"\
\
At special request from Princess Aisling, Lavigny\'s Legion has been
tasked with protecting those who are transporting these valuable cargos.
Combat bonds will be reimbursed for all wanted ships that are destroyed
in the system, and can be delivered to Mackenzie Relay starport in the
Cemiess system.\
\
The top 75% of contributors will also receive the Python Predator Teal
paint job.\
\
The campaign begins on 22nd of September 3308 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.
