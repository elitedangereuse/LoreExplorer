Two leading engineers have revealed designs to improve the stock
anti-xeno weaponry available to pilots.\
\
Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have provided module modifications for many
years, specialising in explosive and kinetic weapons respectively. Over
the past year they have collaborated privately on the AX weapon designs
introduced by Aegis in 3303, seeking to improve the efficiency of
delivering a compound, hazardous to Thargoid vessels, which tips AX
ammunition.\
\
Ryder explained to The Imperial Herald:\
\
\"Zack and I share a passion for weapon upgrades, and have often used
this project as a way to unwind after a long week\'s work. But when the
Taranis signal arrived and the Thargoid forces started taking control of
systems, we knew we had to reveal the designs to the public. We\'re
going to need help from independent pilots to finish off the prototypes
and get a manufacturing base set up.\"\
\
This campaign is for a fixed-mount enhanced AX Multi-Cannon, to be made
available in both Medium and Large sizes. Ru Shil Empire Party has
agreed to process deliveries, with Liz Ryder vouching for the faction\'s
commitment to the anti-xeno project despite concerns over their
reputation.\
\
The project will run for eight weeks. If the final target is met earlier
than planned, the campaign will end immediately and the fixed-mount
enhanced AX Multi-Cannon will be made available at all rescue megaships
shortly afterwards.
