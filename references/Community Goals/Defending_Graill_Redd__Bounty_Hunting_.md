Authorities in the Graill Redd system have reported a sharp increase in
the number or criminals operating in the area. Apparently, organisations
in the neighbouring systems - the Citizen Party of G146-60 and the
Worker\'s Party on G 176-29 - are attempting to cultivate discord in the
system in order to pave the way for the introduction of communism.\
\
To counter this threat, the Graill Redd Liberals have placed a kill
order on all wanted ships operating in the Graill Redd system, and have
promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to J. G. Ballard
Gateway.\
\
The campaign begins on the 30th June 3302 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at J. G. Ballard Gateway. Only Bounty Vouchers handed
in after signing up will count towards your personal contribution
total.\
