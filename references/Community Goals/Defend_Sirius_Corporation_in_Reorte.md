The Reorte Mining Coalition has declared its intent to remove the Sirius
Corporation presence from its home system.\
\
The megaship Chariot of Rhea arrived in Reorte as part of Sirius
Corporation\'s new role as the Alliance\'s strategic defence partner.
But the system\'s controlling faction ordered it to withdraw. The
megaship\'s non-compliance has resulted in skirmishes targeting Sirius
forces.\
\
Captain Delfina Dominguez of the Sirius Navy, who commands the Chariot
of Rhea released a statement:\
\
\"Our presence is authorised by the military contract between Sirius
Corporation and the Alliance Defence Force. If local forces continue to
attack, we will have no option but to defend our assets.\"\
\
The fighting is not believed to have reached surface level and is
expected to remain a ship-based conflict.\
\
To rally support from independent pilots, the Sirius Corporation will
authorise a permit to the Sirius system for the top 75% of supporters.\
\
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has ordered the Reorte Mining Coalition to
cease hostilities immediately. However, Councillor Ainsley Niven -- who
represents Reorte in the Assembly and is a political supporter of Nakato
Kaine -- claims that the faction has the right to protect its territory,
since it was not invited to ratify the defence pact.\
\
The two factions have set out seven-day combat operations, which will
begin on the 27th January 3308.
