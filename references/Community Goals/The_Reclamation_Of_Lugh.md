Ahead of the main assault group, the Lugh for Equality Party are
preparing to launch a series of attacks to reclaim stations currently
under control of the Crimson State Group.\
It won\'t be easy. The Crimson State Group are sure to have heavily
fortified their positions, and they won\'t give them up without a
serious fight. Federal fighters will need to intercept, distract and
destroy Crimson State Group pilots long enough to provide time for the
ground troops to break through the rebel defenses and secure the targets
for use as forward bases for Federal forces.\
This campaign must be completed before the Crimson State Group manages
to capture Hartsfield Market.
