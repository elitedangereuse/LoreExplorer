The Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been tasked with constructing a new
forward operating base in the Pleiades Sector Ab-W B2-4 system on behalf
of the Empire. The new outpost will support the Empire\'s ongoing
operations in the Pleiades Nebula.\
\
A spokesperson for the Merope Expeditionary Fleet released a statement:\
"I realise some might perceive this as an attempt to assert Imperial
dominion over the Pleiades Nebula, but establishing a strong military
presence in the Pleiades is the only way we can oppose federal attempts
to establish a monopoly on meta-alloys."\
\
In support of this initiative, the Merope Expeditionary Fleet has placed
an open order for Power Generators, Tantalum and Auto Fabricators, and
has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to its base
of operations at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of September 3302 and will run for one
week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Power Generators, Tantalum or Auto Fabricators to
Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
