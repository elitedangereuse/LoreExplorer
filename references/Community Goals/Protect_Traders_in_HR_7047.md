The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced plans to
construct a new asteroid base among the rings of HR 7047 2 C, and has
placed an open order for construction materials.\
\
To ensure those delivering commodities can do so safely, the Wolves of
Jonai have placed a kill order on all ships on their wanted list,
promising to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Grant Dock in
the HR 7047 system.
