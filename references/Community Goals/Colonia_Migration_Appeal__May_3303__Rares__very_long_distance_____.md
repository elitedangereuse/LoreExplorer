The sixth Colonia migration appeal has now begun, giving the galaxy\'s
minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the
Colonia Nebula.\
\
This month, the Council has targeted the following systems for
colonisation:\
•Eol Prou RS-T d3-612\
•Eol Prou NR-L c8-152\
•Eol Prou LW-L c8-83\
•Eol Prou PX-T d3-1134\
•Eol Prou UN-W b17-5\
•Eol Prou OH-K c9-245\
•Eol Prou IW-W e1-973\
•Eol Prou IW-W e1-1456\
•Eol Prou IW-W e1-1696\
•Eol Prou RS-T d3-611\
\
To compete for a migration visa, pilots must sign up with Colonia
Migration Services before delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Jaques
Station in the Colonia system.\
\
At the end of the appeal, the ten factions that have made the largest
contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified
systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for
each organisation\'s use.\
\
Be aware that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will be
considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction.\
\
The Colonia Council have stated that after this month\'s appeal the
Migration Initiative will be put on hold for a few months, allowing them
to strengthen the infrastructure and review the process before
colonising more worlds in the region.\
\
The campaign begins on the 4th of May 3303 and will run for four weeks.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To participate in the appeal you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Jaques Station in the
Colonia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
