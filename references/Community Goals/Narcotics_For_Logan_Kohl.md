A smuggler by the name of Logan Kohl claims to have made a discovery of
profound importance. Although Kohl has offered a clue to the location of
this discovery, he has said he will only reveal further information if
he is given \"enough narcotics to kill a rhinoceros\".\
\
Independent pilots are therefore invited to deliver quantities of
narcotics to Bridger Enterprise in the Cail System. If Kohl\'s targets
are met, he will offer the public a second clue.\
