The Imperial Slaver\'s Association is currently in the process of
sourcing a large quantity of unregulated Slaves in order to bolster the
number of Imperial Slaves available for work in the region.\
\
As such ISA, in conjunction with Senator Zemina Torval, are offering a
generous reward scheme open to any traders willing to sell Slaves to the
ISA training centre on Lagerkvist Gateway.\
\
In addition to which, Senator Torval has sworn that if ISA is able to
acquire more slaves than Stop Slavery Stupid over the course of the next
week, the senator will sell every slave retrained as part of this
initiative at a significantly reduced cost.
