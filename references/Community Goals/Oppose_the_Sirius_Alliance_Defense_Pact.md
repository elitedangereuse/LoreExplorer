The Di Jian system is hosting competing campaigns as the Alliance
Assembly votes on the strategic defence pact.\
\
The Assembly is evenly split over formalising military ties with Sirius
Corporation to enhance defensive options against the Thargoids, with a
decision expected at the end of June. In advance of the vote, both
pro-pact and anti-Sirius councillors are attempting to sway colleagues
to their cause by securing a sizeable resource package for the Alliance
Defence Force.\
\
The anti-Sirius lobby has requested deliveries asking for shipments of
computer components, reinforced mounting plates and synthetic reagents
to Preuss Terminal in the Di Jian system. The system\'s controlling
faction, Sol\'s Salutis Aeternum, is overseeing contributions. Engineers
Uma Laszlo and Bill Turner have both expressed a hope that the anti-xeno
pact with Sirius is denied.\
\
To encourage support from pilots, Sol\'s Salutis Aeternum is offering a
stock Alliance Chieftain to the top 25 Preuss Terminal campaign
contributors only. Other rewards are available for contributors outside
this number.\
\
Top 75%: Alioth Permit\
Top 50%: Access to Bill Turner\'s Workshop\
Access to Uma Laszlo Workshop\
Top 25 CMDRs: Alliance Chieftain\
\
The campaign will run until the 23rd June 3308. If the final target is
met earlier than planned, or the opposing campaign is completed first,
the campaign will end immediately.
