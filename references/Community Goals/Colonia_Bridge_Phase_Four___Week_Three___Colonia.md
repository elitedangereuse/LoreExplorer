Further deliveries to Alcor and Colonia are required to add new
facilities to the Colonia Bridge starports.\
\
The Colonia Bridge project is currently halfway through its final phase,
which takes place over a four-week period. In the previous week, pilots
supplied large quantities of performance enhancers, personal weapons and
survival equipment.\
\
A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined the next stage:\
\
\"Thanks to the hard work of many independent pilots, we have
established Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge and Search and Rescue services
at the six starports along the travel corridor between the core systems
and the Colonia region.\"\
\
\"For week three, our aim is to continue constructing the stations by
installing a material trader, concourse bar and mission contract
services. These will rely on shipments of liquor, computer components
and water purifiers.\"\
\
\"For pilots who deliver these to Jaques Station in the Colonia system,
Brewer Corporation will be pleased to offer a White Engine Drive Colour
and a White Carrier Drive Colour for the top 75% of participants,
alongside payment in credits.\"\
\
Once this week\'s initiative concludes, week four will aim to complete
the Colonia Bridge starports with a full range of services.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to the first starport out from Colonia, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Bar Tender\
Tier 2: Material Trader\
Tier 3: Missions\
\
Part three of the four-week campaign begins on the 24th of February 3308
and will run for one week.
