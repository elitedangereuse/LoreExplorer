Things aren\'t looking good. The Federal Navy is trying to fight a war
on two fronts, and right now, it\'s losing. The President has ordered
the Navy to provide more firepower to the Khasiri Liberals so that they
can oust the invaders from BD+03 2338 once and for all! Unfortunately,
it doesn\'t look like they\'re going to get here fast enough to stop the
rebels from fortifying their position.\
\
That\'s where you come in! Every combat bond you earn on behalf of the
Federation in BD+03 2338 will help weaken the invaders position and
increase the amount of credits the Khasiri Liberals are permitted to
spend from the federal war chest! Help the people of BD+03 2338 in their
hour of need, and prevent the deployment of Capital Ships to this
sector.
