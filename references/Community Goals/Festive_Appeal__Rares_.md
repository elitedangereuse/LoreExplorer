Many cultures choose to mark the end of the galactic year with the
giving and receiving of gifts, and this year will be no exception. In
anticipation of this busy period, luxury goods supplier Santa Muerte
Co-operative has placed an open order for personal gifts. The
organisation\'s CEO, Nicolas St Clauss, released the following statement
to the media:\
\
"This year we\'re asking pilots to bring goods from Frost Dock in the
Njambalba system to Clauss Port in Santa Muerte. In exchange, we\'re
offering generous financial rewards and special festive prizes for those
who make the largest contributions."\
\
The campaign begins on the 22nd of December 3302 and will run for two
weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Personal Gifts from Frost Dock in the Njambalba system
to Clauss Port in the Santa Muerte system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
