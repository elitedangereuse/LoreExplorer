Following a skirmish with a group of mercenaries, security forces in the
Meene system have launched an operation to capture enemy agents in order
to investigate the attack.\
\
Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force gave the
following statement:\
The mercenaries were targeting Ram Tah\'s Phoenix Base, but it\'s clear
they were just hired hands. We need to recover as many surviving
mercenaries as we can and interrogate them, so we can find the real
culprits.\
\
The Independent HIP 29241 Green Party, which is overseeing the
initiative, has requested commanders recover Occupied & Damaged Escape
Pods in the system and bring them to Felice Dock for this purpose.
