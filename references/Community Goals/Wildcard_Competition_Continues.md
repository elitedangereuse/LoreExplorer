The first stage of the Dangerous Games \'Wildcard\' competition is over,
and the second is about to begin. For this heat, pilots have been asked
to head to the Bjorti system and deploy their hardpoints for a
bounty-hunting contest. The faction that accumulates the most bounty
vouchers during the week-long event will be declared the winner.\
\
The Dangerous Games Wildcard competition will run for a total of three
weeks, and the victor will go on to vie for the right to be recognised
as an official power.\
