The Independent Djaujas Progressive Party is pleased to announce that
Djaujas A 1 has now entered the third stage of its terraforming process.
Technicians working for Big G Corporation are currently in the process
of preparing the necessary equipment in order to launch the next stage.\
\
Unfortunately due to lack of Land Enrichment Systems, the project has
been temporarily delayed until such time as an adequate supply of Land
Enrichment Systems can be obtained.\
\
In order to get the project back on schedule, the Independent Djaujas
Progressive Party are offering a range of rewards to pilots who help
ship Land Enrichment Systems to the technicians aboard Von Krusenstern
Entreprise before the project enters stage 3.
