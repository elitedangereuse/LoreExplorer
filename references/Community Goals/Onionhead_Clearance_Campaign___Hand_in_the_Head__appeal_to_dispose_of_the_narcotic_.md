The ongoing Federal campaign against Onionhead has taken a new turn with
the appointment of an 'Onionhead tzar\', who will assume overall
responsibility for eliminating the drug from Federal space. Edward
Bores, a seasoned government official, has assumed the role, promising
to employ "targeted measures" in the fight against the illegal narcotic.
At a press event, Bores marked his appointment with the announcement of
an innovative new campaign:\
\
\
\
"We are launching an initiative called 'Hand in the Head\' designed to
encourage Federal citizens to surrender any Onionhead in their
possession. Individuals who deliver Onionhead to our headquarters at
Grandin Gateway in the Altair system will be generously rewarded. At the
end of the campaign, any Onionhead we have received will be destroyed."\
