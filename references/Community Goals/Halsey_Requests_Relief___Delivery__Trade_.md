Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has appealed for relief for the
refugees at Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
\
In a statement, Halsey said:\
\
\"Dirichlet Orbital has already become a haven for those fleeing the
ongoing conflict between the Empire and the Federation. But if we are to
provide these people with ongoing care, we will need the help of the
galactic community. Fortunately the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry has
volunteered to support a relief operation\"\
\
The Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry has pledged to reward pilots who
deliver Natural Fabrics, Food Cartridges and Basic Medicines to
Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
\
The campaign begins on 30th of March 3303 and will run for one week. If
the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Natural Fabrics, Food Cartridges and Basic Medicines
to Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
