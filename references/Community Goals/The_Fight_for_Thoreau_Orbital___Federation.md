Federal intelligence operatives have uncovered an Imperial plot to
destabilize the Thoreau Orbital outpost in the Obotrima. The starport is
a major manufacturing centre for autonomous defence drones, more
commonly known as skimmers.\
\
According to a leaked report, the Imperial organisation Chimechilo
Empire League plans to flood the black market at Thoreau Orbital with
explosives in the hope of disrupting skimmer production. To counter this
threat, the Obotrima Organisation has asked Federation-aligned pilots to
deliver skimmer components and robotics to the outpost in order to
manufacture new skimmers.\
\
The operation is scheduled to run for one week from the 15th of
September 3302. If the Obotrima Organisation achieves its aims before
then, the campaign will end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering skimmer components and robotics to Thoreau Orbital in
the Obotrima system.\
\
The project is scheduled to run for one week, but if the final target is
met earlier than planned the campaign will end immediately.\
\
Please be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other
disruptive events can negatively impact markets and station services,
and could prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
