Earlier this month, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise entered Maia and
rapidly started cementing its presence in the system. In response, the
Ant Hill Mob - Maia\'s current controlling faction - launched an
offensive against the Pleiades Resource Enterprise.\
\
With the Federation having recently stationed a Farragut-class
Battlecruiser at Maia A 3 a, there is speculation that the appearance of
the Pleiades Resource Enterprise represents an effort to bring Maia
under Federal control.\
\
A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise gave a brief
statement:\
\
\"The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has every right to establish a
presence in Maia. If the Ant Hill Mob wants a fight, it\'s going to get
it.\"\
\
The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has appealed to the galaxy\'s Federal
pilots for help, promising to generously reward those who support their
operation.\
\
The campaign will begin on the 27th of October 3302 and will run for one
week.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds at Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has set out week-long operation to
resist the Ant Hill Mob, but if either side is defeated before the end
of the week, the conflict will end immediately.\
\
Please note that crew members will take a percentage cut of combat bonds
when they are handed in. This percentage is based on their rank and
their cut of the combat bonds will not count towards your community goal
contribution.\
