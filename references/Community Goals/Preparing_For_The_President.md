President Halsey is planning to arrive any day now, and it\'s important
that her visit goes off without a hitch.\
\
Acting under advisement of Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Mayor
Bailey has ordered an increase in security throughout the sector, until
such time as the President has passed out of Alliance space.\
\
To help facilitate the increased security requirements, Pilots
Federation members in good standing are being asked to assist Alliance
law enforcement officers in their duties. As an incentive, the Allioth
Independents are offering a bonus reward scheme which is open to all
eligible pilots who sign up to act as deputies during this tense time.
