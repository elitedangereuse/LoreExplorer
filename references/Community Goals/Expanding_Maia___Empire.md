The Empire has announced plans to expand its presence in Maia by
constructing a new outpost in the system. But with a shortage of
reliable supply lines into the system, the superpower is relying on the
galactic community for help in compiling the necessary materials. The
Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been authorised to oversee the appeal.\
\
Open orders have been placed for Building Fabricators, Energy Grid
Assemblies, and Micro-Weave Cooling Hoses, and the Merope Expeditionary
Fleet has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to
Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
The campaign begins on the 20th of April 3303 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assemblies and
Micro-weave Cooling Hoses to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
