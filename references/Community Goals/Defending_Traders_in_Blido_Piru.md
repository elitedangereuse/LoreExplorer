Angeli Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire\'s key suppliers of
foodstuffs and other consumables, has announced plans to build a
Bowman-class science vessel.\
\
The construction initiative, dubbed the Rekohu Project, will allow the
organisation to increase the biodiversity of its crops. One complete,
the megaship will be deployed to the PLAA AIN Sector the research life
on Earth-like worlds.\
\
The organisation\'s spokesperson, Commander Blain Crighton, released the
following statement:\
\
\"For a civilisation with near-limitless energy and the ability to cross
the stars in the blink of an eye, how is it that we still have systems
experiencing famine? The Rekohu Project is an effort to change that, and
to find new ways to keep even the poorest fed.\"\
\
In support of this goal, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed a kill
order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing
commodities to the initiative can do so safely.\
