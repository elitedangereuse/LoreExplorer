The Alliance Council of Admirals has announced that an Alliance convoy
has been attacked in the Fedmich system.\
\
Most personnel were safely evacuated, but many of the ships comprising
the convoy had to be abandoned. Furthermore, a number of occupied escape
pods remain among the wreckage, along with caches of Wreckage
Components.\
\
A spokesperson for the Council of Admirals released a statement:\
\
"It is imperative that all personnel and material carried by this convoy
be recovered as soon as possible."\
\
"To that end, we have authorised Fedmich Electronics Partners to
coordinate a rescue operation, and will gladly reward those who deliver
Occupied Escape Pods and Wreckage Components to Roberts Port in the
Fedmich system. Combat pilots are also needed to neutralise agitators
operating in Fedmich and thus ensure the safety of those recovering
material from the convoy."\
\
The operation begins on the 26th of January 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Occupied Escape Pods and Wreckage Components to
Roberts Port in the Fedmich system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
