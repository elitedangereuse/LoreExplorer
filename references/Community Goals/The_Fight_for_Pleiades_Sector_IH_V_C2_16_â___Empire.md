\
Recent reports from the Empire-controlled Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16
system indicate that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, a Federal
organisation, is preparing to launch an assault with the aim of taking
the region from the Empire.\
\
A spokesperson for the Imperial Inquisition, which is coordinating the
Imperial resistance, said:\
\
"I would not surrender so much as an inch of territory to the Federation
-- I am certainly not about to surrender the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16
system. I hope the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is prepared for a
fight."\
\
The Imperial Inquisition has asked all Empire-aligned pilots to travel
to Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16 and help repel the Federal offensive.\
\
Both factions have set out a week-long operation for control of the
system, which will begin on the 11th of August 3302.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds at TII Research Facility in Pleiades
Sector IH-V C2-16 system.\
\
Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the
system, but if either side is defeated before the end of the week the
conflict will end immediately.
