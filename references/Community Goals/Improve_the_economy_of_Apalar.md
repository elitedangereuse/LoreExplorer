The Apalar system has issued a request for industrial materials in order
to elevate its economy. The system is strategically positioned between
the territories of several major powers, and is therefore hoping to
raise its economy so it can serve these powers as a major trade hub.\
\
To assist wit this effort, Apalar Labour is offering a series of
incentives to pilots who deliver industrial materials to Svavarsson
Terminal until such time as the target established by the Apalar
government have been met.
