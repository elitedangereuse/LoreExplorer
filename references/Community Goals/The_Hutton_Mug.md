A company based in Alpha Centauri is producing commemorative mugs for
those who complete the so-called \'Hutton run\' - the 0.22 light-year
trek from the system\'s star to Hutton Orbital. The mugs, which bear the
legend \'I made it to Hutton Orbital\', are made from Scrap material,
and the company is in need of additional material with which to produce
their next batch. To help with this effort, the Alpha Centauri Freedom
Party is offering a series of incentives to pilots who deliver Scrap to
Hutton Orbital until such time as targets have been met.
