Federal President Zachary Hudson has announced plans to add a new
Farragut Battle Cruiser to the Federal fleet. The gigantic new vessel
will be capable of transporting multiple Federal Corvettes in addition
to boasting an array of heavy weaponry. Captain G.C. Richards, who is
overseeing construction of the new ship, issued a brief statement to the
media:\
\
\"This new battle cruiser will occupy a significant role in the Federal
Navy, strengthening our borders and enhancing the profile of our armed
forces. In the interest of completing production as efficiently as
possible, we have authorised the Beta Hydri Corporation to reimburse
pilots who deliver essential supplies to our base of operations at
Stevenson Base. This is an opportunity for those loyal to the Federation
to support a vitally important initiative.\"\
\
The campaign begins on the 10th of March 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
Pilots who support the operation will be generously reimbursed.\

Note: You need to deliver Computer Components\
