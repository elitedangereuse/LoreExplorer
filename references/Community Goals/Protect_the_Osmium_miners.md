Alongside its appeal for Osmium, LHS 2936 Alliance Combine has issued an
open kill order on any ships attacking mining vessels bringing the rare
metal to Fraser Orbital in the LHS 2936 system. the faction is offering
significant financial incentives to reward pilots that help in the
appeal.\
\
Edit: A great source for bounty hunting is the nearby Parjanya or NLTT
34715 / LHS 2637 system. In the ring of planet A4 you will find three
dangerous RES sites.\
\
Dont forget that Alliance Bountys must be rewarded at LHS 2936.
