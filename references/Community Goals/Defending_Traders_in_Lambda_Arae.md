The Atlas Corporation has launched a campaign to build a megaship in the
Lambda Arae system.\
\
The vessel, which will be named the ACS Overwatch, will fulfil a
multi-faceted role in the ongoing fight against the Thargoids.\
\
A spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation said:\
The ACS Overwatch will serve as a coordination point for rescue missions
and anti-Thargoid operations, as well as being a valuable resupply point
and a safe haven for the people of Lambda Arae.\
In support of this goal, the Atlas Corporation has placed an open order
for various commodities and has also placed a kill order on all ships on
its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities to Redi
Market can do so safely.\
\
\
Haz RESs are found in the systems Mehet, CF 16001 and Ghimal. All the 3
systems are controlled by the Atlas Corporation, so the bounties are
useful for the CG.
