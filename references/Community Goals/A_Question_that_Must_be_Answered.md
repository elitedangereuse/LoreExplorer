If you\'re reading this, you found my message. And maybe you can help.\
\
My name is Ishmael Palin. I\'m a scientist and engineer researching the
mysterious ships.\
\
I have made a significant breakthrough, but I am in need of certain data
to confirm my latest hypothesis. If what I suspect is true, it could be
of importance to the entire galaxy.\
\
Unfortunately I am unable to leave my research base due to a Federal
blockade, so I am appealing to the galactic community to gather Unknown
Ship Signatures and Unknown Wake Scans by scanning the unknown ships and
their wakes. Thanks to the support of the Merope Expeditionary Fleet, I
am able to offer financial rewards to those who deliver this data to
Orcus Crag in the Pleiades Sector OI-T C3-7 system.\
\
It won\'t be long before the Federation realises what I\'m up to, so I
can only keep this operation running until 12 noon on 13th June 3303. As
soon as my experiment is complete, I will share the results with the
galactic community.\
\
To help Professor Palin and earn rewards you must sign up as an active
participant before delivering Unknown Ship Signatures and Unknown Wake
Scans to Orcus Crag in the Pleiades Sector OI-T C3-7 system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
