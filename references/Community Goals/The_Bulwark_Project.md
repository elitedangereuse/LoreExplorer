The Federation has launched an initiative to develop autonomous military
hardware with which to fight the Thargoids.\
\
Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters shed further light on the
initiative, which has been christened the Bulwark Project:\
As the Thargoids\' aggression escalates, it\'s essential that we find
ways to minimise casualties while continuing to protect ourselves. Aegis
is doing commendable work, but it needn\'t be our only line of defence.\
Imperial commentators have criticised the initiative, however, drawing
attention to long-standing conventions against the development of
artificial intelligence. Shadow President Winters was quick to dismiss
such concerns, saying:\
\
The purpose of the Bulwark Project is to investigate alternative defence
strategies, not to develop machine intelligence.\
The operation has received financial support from the Momoirent Central
and Co, which has placed an open order for various commodities for use
in the campaign.
