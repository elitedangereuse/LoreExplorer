The Adad Exchange has launched an operation to recover valuable military
intelligence from the wreckage of a Federal convoy in the Sutekh system.
The organisation has appealed to the galactic community for support,
promising to reward pilots who support its operation.\
\
The campaign begins on the 16th of February 3303 and will run for one
week. If the operation achieves its aims earlier than planned, it will
end immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering salvaged Data Cores to Archimedes Gateway in the
Sutekh system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
