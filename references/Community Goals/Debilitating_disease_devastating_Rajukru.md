A terrifying disease is currently working its way through Rajukru. So
far the illness has defied attempts to contain it, despite the best
efforts of medical staff aboard Snyder Terminal.\
\
Many people have already been placed in quarantine, with many more
thought to have already been infected. Doctors are concerned that the
pathogen responsible may have already begun to spread to other systems.
To assist medical staff aboard Snyder Terminal, the Coalition of Rajukru
are offering a series of incentives to any pilots that provide medicines
to Snyder Terminal market until such time as the crisis has been
averted.
