Azimuth Biotech has called for commodities to be delivered to the
Glorious Prospect in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system.\
\
Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, outlined the
new initiative:\
\
\"Once the Proteus Wave has eliminated the Thargoids, the second phase
of our corporate strategy will commence. As per our agreement with the
Alliance, Empire and Federation, Azimuth Biotech is licensed to collect
limited quantities of any remaining non-human material in the HIP 22460
system. The powerless Thargoid vessels will be taken to specialised
laboratories for examination, and the subsequent results shared with the
superpowers\' military intelligence divisions.\"\
\
\"Unfortunately, Azimuth has experienced significant losses in several
systems, as a result of actions taken by \'Operation Wych Hunt\'
saboteurs. This has prevented us from setting up research labs and
analytical equipment, delaying our xeno-retrieval programme
considerably.\"\
\
\"To counteract this setback, we require shipments of HN shock mounts,
micro controllers and radiation baffles. The Glorious Prospect megaship
stands ready in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system to receive these
deliveries.\"\
\
As well as credit payments, Azimuth Biotech has agreed to make
pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons available as an additional reward
for pilots who transport the greatest volume of commodities.\
\
Top 75%: One small Salvation Shard Cannon\
Top 50%: Additional small Salvation Shard Cannon\
Top 25%: One medium Salvation Shard Cannon\
\
The first stage of the campaign begins on the 28th July 3308 and will
run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.
