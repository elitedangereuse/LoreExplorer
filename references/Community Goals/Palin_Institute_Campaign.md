The Palin Institute has announced an accelerated programme of study to
analyse a range of xenobiological data, and perhaps discern the motives
behind the Thargoids\' unrelenting aggression.\
\
Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, released the
following statement:\
In recent months, the Institute has performed countless studies on alien
technology and physiology, and our stock of xenobiological samples is
severely depleted. For this robust new study, we require a large amount
of Thargoid material to support a wide range of experiments.\
\
The Ryder Revolutionary Party, which is supporting the campaign, has
placed an open order for various Thargoid materials and has promised to
reward pilots who deliver these goods to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia
system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on
its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering materials to Obsidian
Orbital can do so safely.
