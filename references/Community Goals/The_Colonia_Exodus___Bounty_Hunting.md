Despite the repeated assurances of the galactic authorities, which have
endeavoured to downplay the scale of the Thargoid threat, it is clear
that many of those in the core systems feel less than secure. This is
evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to Colonia, eager to
escape the ire of the Thargoids.\
\
In response to this development, the Colonia Council has announced plans
to establish a number of new outposts in the Colonia region, and has
placed an open order for construction materials. The Council has also
placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that
those delivering materials can do so safely. Pilots who hand in Bounty
Vouchers at Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar system will be
generously rewarded.\
\
The campaigns begin on the 7th of December 3303 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will
end immediately.\
\
To earn rewards you must sign up as an active participant before handing
in Bounty Vouchers at Pilkington Orbital in the Einheriar system. Only
Bounty Vouchers handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your bounty
vouchers will be automatically assigned to them. These bounty vouchers
will not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew
will receive the reward for their vouchers when they are handed in. The
proportion of bounty vouchers assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
