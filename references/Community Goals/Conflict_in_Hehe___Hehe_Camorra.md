Authorities in the Hehe system have reported that conflict has erupted
between Hehe Federal Interstellar and Hehe Camorra. System security
forces have confirmed that the fighting began several hours ago and has
escalated rapidly since then.\
\
The conflict is understood to be territorial in nature, with both
factions eager to take control of Hehe. Both sides have issued calls for
support, and have pledged to reward combat pilots who rally to their
respective causes.\
\
A representative of system security forces commented on the
development:\
"Inter-faction conflict of this sort tends to be quite focused, and we
believe that the probability of civilian casualties is low.
Nevertheless, we\'re advising anyone living or travelling in the system
to exercise caution."\
\
The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of
the system, which will begin on the 3rd of August 3303.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before handing in Combat Bonds at Rutherford Hub in the Hehe system.
Only combat bonds handed in after signing up will count toward your
personal contribution total.\
\
Please note that if you have any crew members, a portion of your combat
bonds will be automatically assigned to them. These combat bonds will
not count towards your personal contribution total, and your crew will
receive the reward for their bonds when they are handed in. The
proportion of combat bonds assigned to your crew will depend on their
rank.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.
