Safeguard Interstellar requires deliveries of medicines to treat
casualties from the NMLA\'s recent terrorist attack.\
\
CEO Noel Beaumont announced:\
\
\"Hundreds of thousands of civilians still require urgent medical
attention after being evacuated from the damaged stations. Many have
severe caustic burns inflicted by the corrosive enzyme payload of the
explosives. We have already exhausted the majority of supplies in nearby
systems.\"\
\
\"To reinforce overstretched health services, we request shipments of
basic medicines and advanced medicines. These can be delivered to Davis
Terminal in the Duamta system.\"\
\
Safeguard Interstellar has partnered with Duamta Gold Creative Corp. to
reward pilots and distribute the medicines.\
\
If Tier 1 is reached, the top 75% of participants will receive a
permanent Sol system permit and a fully engineered class 3 rating A
overcharged and armoured Power Plant. The module will be placed in
storage at Davis Terminal in the Duamta system by the 26th of March
3307.\
\
The joint initiative will run for one week. If the final target is met
earlier than planned, the initiative will end immediately.
