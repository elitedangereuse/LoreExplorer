Brewer Corporation has requested a new batch of deliveries to the Alcor
and Colonia systems.\
\
The Colonia Bridge is comprised of 56 stationary megaships and six
starports, providing facilities to travellers between the core systems
and the Colonia region. However, the starports are still in a state of
construction.\
\
The megacorp outlined its latest requirements in a press release:\
\
\"Phase four of the Colonia Bridge project launched with a highly
satisfactory first week. Shipments of coffee, emergency power cells,
geological equipment and liquid oxygen arrived in sufficient numbers to
ensure Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics services were added to
all six starports.\"\
\
\"The goal of the second week is to continue assembling the stations\'
infrastructure, and install Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge and Search and
Rescue services. To achieve this, performance enhancers, personal
weapons and survival equipment are needed in large quantities.\"\
\
\"Pilots are asked to provide these at Jaques Station in the Colonia
system. As well as guaranteeing generous reimbursement to all
contributors, Brewer Corporation is pleased to offer warm, white cockpit
lights as an additional token of gratitude.\"\
\
The third and fourth weeks of the project\'s final phase will focus on
adding further services on the Colonia Bridge starports to accommodate
all pilot professions.\
\
Each tier reached will enable Brewer Corporation to establish a further
service to the first starport out from Colonia, as follows:\
\
Tier 1: Pioneer Supplies\
Tier 2: Crew Lounge and Search and Rescue\
\
Part two of the four-week campaign begins on the 17th of February 3308
and will run for one week.
