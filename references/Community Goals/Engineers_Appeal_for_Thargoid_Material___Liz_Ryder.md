Following news that the Thargoids have attacked a Federal convoy in the
Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system, Aegis has recruited two of the
galaxy\'s foremost independent engineers to immediately begin developing
new defensive and offensive technologies.\
\
One of these engineers is Liz Ryder, a specialist in explosive weaponry,
who spoke to The Federal Times about her involvement:\
\
It\'s not about penetrating the Thargoids\' shields -- we\'ve been
blowing each other up for centuries so we\'ve gotten pretty good at
dealing punishment -- it\'s about creating weapons that are specifically
calibrated to damage Thargoid hardware.\
\
Ryder was asked if she thought it was too late to avert all-out conflict
with the Thargoids:\
\
That\'s a question for the politicians. My job is to design weapons. And
if someone -- or something -- shoots at you, you\'ve got two choices:
run away or shoot back. At the moment, the first of those is our only
option. It would be nice to have a second.\
\
Aegis has placed an open order for a range of Thargoid materials for use
in the programme. Aegis Core has pledged to reward pilots who deliver
Unknown Technology Samples, Unknown Biological Matter, Ancient Relics
and Explosives to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system for Liz Ryder.\
\
The campaign begins on the 21st of September and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
\
To be eligible for rewards you must sign up as an active participant
before delivering Unknown Technology Samples, Unknown Biological Matter,
Ancient Relics and Explosives to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.\
\
Be aware that faction-state changes, UA bombing and other disruptive
events can negatively impact markets and station services, and could
prevent the initiative from running smoothly.\
