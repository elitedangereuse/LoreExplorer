The Privateer\'s Alliance has announced plans to build a military
installation in the HIP 33368 system.\
\
The installation will "reinforce the gates" by defending the core
systems from Thargoid forces in the Pleiades.\
\
A spokesperson for the Privateer\'s Alliance released the following
statement:\
We need to make a show of strength. That is why we are humbly requesting
the help of the galactic community in building this installation.\
\
Once complete, it will allow pilots from across the galaxy --
irrespective of their allegiance -- to work together in resisting the
Thargoid threat.\
In support of this goal, the Privateer\'s Alliance has placed an open
order for various commodities, and has pledged to reward pilots who
deliver these commodities to Barjavel Station in the HIP 33368 system.
