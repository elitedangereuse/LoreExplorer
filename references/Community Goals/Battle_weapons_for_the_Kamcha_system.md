Emperor\'s Dawn has issued an open contract for Battle Weapons with
which to fulfil various private military commitments. The organisation
has access to considerable reserves, and is offering a series of
generous incentives to pilots who deliver Battle Weapons to Saarinen
Station until such time as its targets have been met.
