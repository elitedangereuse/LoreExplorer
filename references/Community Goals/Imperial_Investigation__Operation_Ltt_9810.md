Before meeting their just fates, the leaders of the Mictlan Cartel
revealed that a secretive criminal consulting firm operating out of LTT
9810 acted as brokers for the contract to kill the Emperor.\
\
Unfortunately trying to track down a deeply hidden criminal organisation
is proving to be exceptionally difficult.\
\
As time is of the essence, Princess Arissa has ordered the death of
every single pirate, smuggler and cur within 50 light years of LTT 9810.
If the criminal consultancy chooses to remain hidden, the Princess has
sworn that the least she will do is make sure they never get another
client again.
