The normally peaceful Wilkes Orbital has been the focus of considerable
attention in recent weeks. Now it seems that the majority of those
recovered from the criminals, including Professor Ishmael Palin, have
been infected with a strain of Cerberus Plague, the deadly pathogen that
claimed millions of lives last year.\
\
Governor Lawrence, the principal administrator of Wilkes Orbital, has
released a statement to the media:\
\
\"The situation is certainly serious, but it\'s important to keep things
in perspective. At present, the disease is confined to those who were
rescued from the Blue Hand Gang, so it should be perfectly possible to
keep it contained. The pertinent task is to cure the infected.\"\
\
Governor Lawrence was asked how he intended to proceed.\
\
\"This is a new strain of the Cerberus Plague, one we\'ve never seen
before. But it seems that Ceremonial Heike Tea, which was used to cure
the original strain of the plague, is also effective against this
version of the disease. We have therefore issued an open order for
Ceremonial Heike Tea with which to cure the infected. Any surplus tea
will be stockpiled in anticipation of further outbreaks, although I
should stress that such a scenario is extremely unlikely.\"\
The appeal for Ceremonial Heike Tea begins on the 17th March 3302 and
will run for one week\
