Authorities in the Ngolibardu system have reported that the number of
criminals operating in the area has risen sharply over the past few
months. Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking
pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing
discord.\
\
To counter this threat, Ngolibardu Electronics Solutions has placed a
kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Ngolibardu system, and
has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Vernadsky
Port.\
\
The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week.
If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end
immediately.\
