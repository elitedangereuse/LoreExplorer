[[id:c22f493d-a4df-429b-824d-e90d5193db99][Hyperspace]], colloquially known as Witch-space, is a [[id:77885a70-cd4f-40a7-8a65-220ddf12bc37][higher-dimensional
region]] through which [[id:594f1645-06bb-4327-b737-cb0e87cc6c73][ships]] can [[id:b59cef9d-3a3d-4e51-9a5f-26a0bd198dbf][travel]] between star systems at
superluminal speeds. Only ships fitted with a hyperdrive are able to
initiate hyperspace jumps on their own. In the 34th century, the most
prevalent hyperdrive design in use among human civilisation is the
Frame Shift Drive ([[id:46a9c980-af48-4e43-a820-9971d7c76c34][FSD]]).
