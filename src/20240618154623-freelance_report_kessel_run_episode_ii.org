* Freelance Report: Kessel Run Episode II

/25 Apr 3302/

The Buckyball Racing Club has organised a second 'Kessel Run' race in celebration of the antique film series 'Star Wars'. Although the interstellar travel depicted in the films is now an everyday fact of life, they still fascinate a large proportion of the galactic community. 

Participants will depart from George Lucas in Leesti on the 30th of April and visit every station bearing the name 'Kessel' before reaching [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]o Orbiter in [[id:144149ef-21cd-4e52-afea-dcf379d12d18][Altair]]. The competition will run until the 15th of May. 

A special event will be held on May the 4th. The Buckyball Racing Club will release details nearer the time.
