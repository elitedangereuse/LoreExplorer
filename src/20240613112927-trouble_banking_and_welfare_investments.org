A relatively new organisation. Trouble Banking and Welfare investments is based in Andceeth. In the early days of the Deferation, Diamond star por was a major centre for commercial transactions between planetary governments. Before the days of the Universal Bulletin Board and guaranteed transfer, the worlds of Andceeth were the banking centre for the Federation. / Since the middle of the 31st century, when the system lost its significance, a group of banking entrepreneurs got together with the custodians of the vaults of Andceeth 2, also known as Trouble and began developing an investment company, using the facilities and security abandoned by the Federation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
