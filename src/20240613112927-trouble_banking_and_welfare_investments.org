* 0229 Trouble Banking and Welfare Investments
[[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]]

A relatively new organisation. Trouble Banking and Welfare Investments
is based in [[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]]. In the early days of the Deferation, Diamond
star por was a major centre for commercial transactions between
planetary governments. Before the days of the Universal Bulletin Board
and guaranteed transfer, the worlds of [[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]] were the banking
centre for the Federation.

Since the middle of the 31st century, when the system lost its
significance, a group of banking entrepreneurs got together with the
custodians of the vaults of [[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]] 2, also known as Trouble and
began developing an investment company, using the facilities and
security abandoned by the Federation.
