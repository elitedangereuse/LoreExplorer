* The Battle of Mudhrid

/25 Nov 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group have declared war in the Mudhrid system. 

The Steel Majesty megaship is serving as the base of the Neo-Marlinist forces. These include many surviving [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] terrorist cells that gathered to overtake the vessel from the Marlinist Colonies.  

Also in the system is the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct, where the NMLA’s de facto leader [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]] and the remnants of Theta Group have been in hiding for months. They recently took control of the vessel and are holding thousands of cultists hostage. 

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid have offered a uniquely augmented enzyme missile rack to its highest contributors if certain objectives are met. Margrave Corentin Delacroix broadcast a call to arms: 

“All those who seek to topple the Duval dictators must fight alongside us here and now. Neo-Marlinism has no future unless its believers defend it.” 

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group is orchestrating its campaign from Payne-Scott City starport. Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] has requested that Imperial auxiliaries provide the faction with combat support. 

ACT’s co-leader Captain Saskia Landau stated: 

“The [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] clearly places huge value on Theta Seven’s ability to produce caustic enzyme weapons, and has risked concentrating in large numbers to defend him. If he can transfer to the Steel Majesty and escape, the threat of further atrocities like the Nine Martyrs bombings will remain high.”
