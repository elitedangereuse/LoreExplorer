* Alliance Gala Initiative Concludes

/13 Sep 3304/

The Alioth Independents has announced that its appeal for exotic food and drink has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. Huge quantities of Esuseku Caviar, Ceremonial Heike Tea and Live Hecate Sea Worms were delivered to Smith Landing over the past week, which will now be used to host their gala event. 

With the initiative at an end, Durien Ballas, chairman of the Alioth Independents, issued the following statement: 

“This will be an event like no other, and we are proud to be introducing Fazia Silva and Elijah Beck to the galactic stage. Along with Gibson Kincaid, I’m sure they will soon do battle in a good-natured yet robust election campaign.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Smith Landing in the Amber system.
