* 0113 Alliance Assembly
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

The Alliance Assembly is the central body for the Alliance as a
whole. While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the
21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. In
main it functions as a means for establishing common policies and
treaties rather than laws.

It also acts as an arbitration body between member states and
depending on Assembly votes can enforce sanctions or corrective
measures. However the politics of the member states often makes this a
tricky process.
