Breakthrough in Artefact Research? 
 
After meticulous and sometimes tedious investigation, scientists working under [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] have uncovered that the recently discovered "Unknown Artefacts" may have some basis in human technology. 

Audio studies of the objects show that they emit a distorted but audible signal matching the very long-established Earth signalling scheme morse code, through which the artefact broadcasts the identity of the nearest celestial body when released into free space. 

Speculation is rife as to what purpose the artefacts have - scanners, navigational aids,  or Thargoid homing-beacons. All of which is considered more concerning now that it is understood that the artefacts appear to have knowledge of morse code, and thus potentially other human technologies, embedded within them. 

[[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]]'s team have renewed their plea to the Federal Government to release any information they possess about the artefacts in order to assist with the continuing research.
