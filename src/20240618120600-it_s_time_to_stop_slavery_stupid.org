* It’s Time to Stop Slavery Stupid

/06 Mar 3301/

[[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] is in the spotlight again today, following a rather passionate outburst on the Empire’s most-watched reality stream show, Celebrity Pets. 

“The [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] is every pet we’ve seen tonight lives a better life than the billions of slaves who are busy working themselves to death while all you viewers just sit there and laugh,” the youngest Duval said during the ever-popular ‘Pimping Pets Get Pampered’ segment. 

“Just take that old bat Zemina. She’s got a whole zoo on that fancy ship of hers. I mean it’s not a good zoo, but I bet her pets get to eat well. Meat even. Her slaves are lucky if they get gruel.  Think they’ve ever got meat? Yeah, right. Slavery is stupid, and it is way past time we stopped it.” 

In support of Aisling’s anti-slavery rhetoric, Stop Slavery Stupid has announced it will once again be accepting Imperial slaves for emancipation and rehabilitation at centres aboard Mackenzie Relay in [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]], Thiele Orbital in Ngun and Naubakht City in Eta Horologii.
