The [[id:ef9a5433-c2f0-4b2e-8223-dcc9fc30db87][Mastopolos]] family were originally from [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]] and several
members rose to positions of significant Senatorial power in the
syste,. However, in 2951, the major interest of [[id:3a273fb7-da83-4a06-b392-358897138889][Giya Mastopolos]] lay in
solving an Imperial resource crisis and so he financed an
expeditionary flotilla into the [[id:dfbc8f06-6724-4a34-a908-f90a2fe3ba43][Zeaex]] system, empowering Erronsa and
Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne
Cambridge of the Federation.

After the death of her husband, Gabriella Mastopolos assumed control
of the Corporation and guided it to new prosperity. Duke's frivolous
ways were quicly forgotten as the organisation ventured out of the
Imperial heartlands and courted new contracts with [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][Alliance]] affiliated
systems, even winning business tenders in Alioth.
