* Nova Imperium Unveils Figurehead

/07 Dec 3304/

Isolationist group Nova Imperium has revealed its choice for Emperor – an eighteen year old man named [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]]. 

The group’s leader, Imperator Mordanticus, broadcast this message: 

“It is incumbent upon me to reveal that [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] fathered not one but two illegitimate children in his younger days. A few years before meeting [[id:33f63de9-fd79-4790-a1a5-ebd87aaeea2d][Florence Lavigny]], he had a brief affair with a slave in the Imperial household. When Hengist’s father discovered this, the matter was hushed up and the slave dismissed. The slave’s son went on to sire a child of his own: [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]], grandson of Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]]. Hadrian was unaware of this until we located him and genetically confirmed his lineage.” 

[[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] is a weak Emperor who must be removed. We call for [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] to be recognised as the true heir to the throne!”  

The Imperial Herald’s political journalist [[id:745efc38-c548-40c0-81d2-82973c604d37][Cassia Carvalho]] observed: 

“This announcement has shaken the Empire to its very foundations. Having Hadrian as a figurehead has rallied those hardliners more comfortable with the idea of a male Emperor. With a single stroke, Nova Imperium has gained considerable credibility and massively increased its support.”
