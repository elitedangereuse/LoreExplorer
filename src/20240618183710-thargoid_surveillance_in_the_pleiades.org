* Thargoid Surveillance in the Pleiades

/10 Mar 3304/

Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula. 

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison at Aegis, made this statement: 

“Our new Eagle Eye initiative will closely monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist.” 

“We have established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades, which will measure energy-level fluctuations and track ship movements. Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis.” 

Aegis has confirmed that Eagle Eye installations have been placed in the following systems: 

HIP 17225 

HIP 17692 

HIP 17892 

HR 1185 

Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 

Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] commented: 

“My hope is that this initiative will greatly increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. Observing their ‘natural’ activities, outside of combat zones, should further our understanding of their behaviour.”
