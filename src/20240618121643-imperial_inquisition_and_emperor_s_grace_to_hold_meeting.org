* Imperial Inquisition and Emperor's Grace to Hold Meeting

/14 Aug 3301/

Imperial Inquisition and Emperor's Grace to Hold Meeting 
 
Mavia Kain, the High Inquisitor and leader of the Imperial Inquisition, is scheduled to pay a visit to Admiral Varrwen Mako Brennus, leader of Emperor`s Grace. The meeting will be held in the Emperor's Grace stronghold of Rishair at Lindblad Port. Both leaders will discuss a number of Imperial issues, including the assassination of Emperor Duval and the present military operations in the Pegasi sector. 

Rumours about the groupsâ€™ cooperation have been circulating since the start of the united Imperial offensive in the Pegasi sector. Both factions are presently engaged in a peacekeeping operation against the Kumo Crew, which began when [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] illegally invaded Imperial space and took Imperial citizens into slavery. Emperor`s Grace and Imperial Inquisition pilots are fighting together against this notorious crime lord, as both groups see him as a threat to galactic peace. 

Sources close to Admiral Brennus revealed that the factions share the same traditional Imperial values. A senior official noted that: "We both care about the Empire, the Imperial way of life, and Imperial citizens. We are natural allies. [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][The Empire]] is going through tough times - we need to support each other."
