* Community Goal: Restoring Order in Slink's Eye

/06 Oct 3302/

Security forces in the Slink's Eye system have reported a dramatic upswing in pirate activity. Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking civilians, disrupting trade and generally causing discord. 

In response to this development, the Revolutionary Slink's Eye Liberals has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Slink's Eye system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Kelleam Ring. The organisation has also vowed to reimburse those who deliver reactive armour to Kelleam Ring to bolster local security forces. 

The campaign begins on the 6th of October and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
