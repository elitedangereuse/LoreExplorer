* Galactic News: Further Migration to [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]]

/30 Dec 3303/

Although the Thargoid attacks have so far been confined to the Pleiades Nebula, many apparently fear that the aliens’ next target will be the core systems. This is evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]]. 

The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Council, the region’s governing body, has confirmed that the number of refugees has skyrocketed in recent weeks, and that the recent attacks against starports have only accelerated the rate of immigration. 

Magen Wolfe, a spokesperson for the Council, said: 

“All who seek sanctuary in [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] will be welcomed, but the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] is that the core systems are no more likely to be targeted by the Thargoids than Colonia. We want to offer our support, but there is a limit to how many people the region can support." 

A campaign to build additional outposts in [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] took place earlier this month, but the pace of immigration means that further construction initiatives may be necessary to support the region’s rapidly expanding population.
