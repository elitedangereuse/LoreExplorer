* [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

/05 Mar 3307/

Former [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] CEO [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] has received a summary
judgement for multiple crimes against the Federation.

The [[id:2230d38f-76ff-439b-8244-bb3852107076][Federal Justice Department]] gave this statement: 

“The facts in the case of [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] are self-evident. His
principal role regarding [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]] and [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] make him
guilty of [[id:ddcb0ea6-aff9-4c93-9613-fd479e942b34][treason]], mass murder and many other crimes. He will serve a
solitary life sentence in a maximum security prison.”

Milandu Okoro of the Federal Attorney’s Office expressed surprise: 

“It is highly unusual for the FJD not to litigate such a major case,
considering we don’t know the full extent of Rochester and Fleet
[[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]]’s conspiracies. Unfortunately, our request to open a
full investigation has been denied.”

Shadow Vice President [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]] has reiterated that her family
were not involved with her eldest son’s clandestine activities.

Core Dynamics is continuing to rebuild after several departments
separated to form Jupiter Division. [[id:167df18a-99f8-4279-bc55-a736f6af44c2][Owen McKenna]], the new CEO, has
vowed to purge the company of all his predecessor’s loyalists.

Despite Rochester’s failure to build a powerbase in the [[id:e1b0c446-0ced-475c-9031-a57e5e3c414f][HIP 54530]]
system, his manifesto of placing the Federation under direct corporate
rule has received praise in some regions. A corporatist movement,
founded by commercial networks and civil groups, is gradually gaining
popularity.
