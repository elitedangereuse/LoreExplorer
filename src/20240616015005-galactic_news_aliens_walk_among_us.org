* Galactic News: Aliens Walk among Us!

/28 Jan 3303/

Outspoken conspiracy theorist [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]] has lent his voice to
the debate surrounding reports of mysterious spacecraft. And true to
form, he has made some rather implausible claims.

On his programme 'Behind the Curtain', Bentonio said:

"I am in contact with an individual who has irrefutable proof that
these ships are [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessels. And what's more, I have been
reliably informed that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] have been exerting direct
influence over human society. Everything that is happening is
unfolding according to their plan. Soon, it will be too late!"

Few in the media or the world of politics deigned to respond to
Bentonio's claims.
