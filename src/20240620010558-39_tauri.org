On the edge of human space there are few holiday destinations. Struck
by Ad Pontes's exceptional natural beauty, few natural resources, and
twelve orbiting ice moons, the first colonists saw the economic sense
in preserving their discovery and advertising "The Planet of the
Zodiac" as a place of relaxation and renewal. Exports are mostly
keepsakes and items with dubious "ancient" spiritual power and
heritage.
