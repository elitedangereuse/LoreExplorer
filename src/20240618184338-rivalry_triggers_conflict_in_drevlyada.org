* Rivalry Triggers Conflict in Drevlyada

/21 Feb 3305/

A long-standing enmity between two military leaders has escalated into hostilities in the Drevlyada system. 

Details were provided by freelance warzone reporter Karleen Troy: 

“The personal rivalry between General Kendrick of Namab Purple Brothers and Marshal Cooper of Drevlyada League has lasted for years. Each frequently accuses the other of incompetence and endangering the people of Drevlyada.” 

“This grudge match has now spiralled into a state of open conflict. Both Kendrick and Cooper have asked the galactic community to provide support in crushing their opponent’s forces.” 

The two factions have set out week-long campaigns to take control of the Drevlyada system, which will begin on the 21st of February 3305.
