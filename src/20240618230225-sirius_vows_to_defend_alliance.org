* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Vows to Defend Alliance

/25 Apr 3308/

Sirius Corporation has claimed that the recent Thargoid incursions prove the necessity of its strategic defence pact with the Alliance. 

The [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]], [[id:b38c4ed0-3aaa-4a86-8acd-a241164d680f][Novas]] and [[id:2a81ce70-848a-46eb-aa0b-b5626e78e8aa][Sosong]] systems are currently withstanding a coordinated attack from large numbers of Thargoid vessels. Independent pilots have rushed to their aid while the three superpowers prepare their respective fleet responses. 

A press conference was held by Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], the liaison between the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] and the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Navy: 

“This unexpected onslaught only underlines the Alliance’s need for military support. The Thargoids can strike anywhere at any time, and Allied systems such as [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]] are vulnerable. Only with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]’s help can we ensure their safety.” 

Journalists pointed out that the Council of Admirals had selected Admiral Rachel Ziegler to lead their anti-xeno taskforce instead of Admiral Glass, despite that being his specific area of expertise. He replied: 

“Well, as you know, the pact is still within its trial period and hasn’t yet been ratified by the Assembly. So there are limits to how involved [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] can be at this stage. I’m sure my colleague will do a fine job while I focus on providing broader support to the [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]] system, such as additional secondments to [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s fleet.”
