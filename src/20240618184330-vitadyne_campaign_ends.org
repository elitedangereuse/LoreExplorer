* Vitadyne Campaign Ends

/31 Jan 3305/

An initiative from Vitadyne Labs to award a distribution licence to a pharmaceutical company has now concluded. 

Professor Katrien Rook announced: 

“Thanks to many hard-working traders, both Neomedical Industries and the Vandermeer Corporation received enormous quantities of advanced medicines, computer components and auto fabricators.” 

“We are evaluating each company’s ability to manufacture the nanomedicines, and will award the contract shortly.” 

Pilots who made deliveries to Neomedical Industries can now collect their rewards from Piserchia Port in Alignak, while those who delivered to the Vandermeer Corporation can collect their rewards from Elion Dock in Kuma.
