* 0680 Imperial Operation Succeeds
[[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]]

On September 15th 3302 the [[id:3d6e93a3-bb3e-42f5-a548-1d09948e874b][Xuangu Crimson Major Network]] announced that
the imperial Operation to recover valuable intelligence from Federal
[[id:9b863f3c-6531-4936-9146-f40e79dd60e7][convoys]] in the Mu Koji system was a success.

But although the Empire achieved its primary goal, victory came at a
cost. Independent correspondents, reporting from Mu Koji, confirmed
that the Empire lost considerably more ships than the Federation.
