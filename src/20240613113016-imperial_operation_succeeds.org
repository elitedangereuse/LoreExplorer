* 0680 Imperial Operation Succeeds
[[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]]

On September 15th 3302 the Xuangu Crimson Major Network announced that
the imperial Operation to recover valuable intelligence from Federal
convoys in the Mu Koji system was a success.

But although [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] achieved its primary goal, victory came at a
cost. Independent correspondents, reporting from Mu Koji, confirmed
that [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] lost considerably more ships than the Federation.
