* 0215 The Dien W'rit Estate
[[id:7075359f-79ca-4a24-88da-64f22e6b024a][Ackwada]]  

In the early part of 3241, [[id:822063f8-7220-41c4-b738-0cdfbba8b05a][Dien W'rit]], a powerful interstellar
entrepeneur, died in unusual circumstances while on holiday in
Yorksville, Thompson's Planet (Ackwada). The matter was complicated
when it was revealed that he had died leaving behind a recently
modified Last Will and Testament which made Thompson , CEO of the
Rockforth Corporation, sole heir to the entire W'rit estate. The W'rit
family alleged corruption, though they had no evidence othen than the
fact of the change in the will.

Then, in July 3251, there was a terrorist attack, launched from
unindentified starships, which attacked one of the headquarter
buildings in Yorksville. A Federal Senator, several Imperial
barristers, and many Rockforth legal staff were killed, not none of
the W'rit family, who had left on a trip to see the local wildlife.

The case was dropped, but the attackers were never found. However, in
3273, several members of the W'rit family were present during an
explosion at an agricultural facility on Altair.
