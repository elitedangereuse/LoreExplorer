* 0237 Walden's Dictatorship
[[id:a7182f72-26f2-4418-aff5-cd5edb77f290][Lave]]

[[id:0b41fd3c-7d4e-4f61-b375-c96b99990d01][Walden]]'s dictatorship in post-[[id:c71d963e-1933-4701-bb5a-d2a4332125c5][GalCop]] decades was a study in the use of
propaganda to further the illusion of contentment. The public face of
Lave was a progressive culture with an enlightened leadership that was
remodelling itself as an independent power in the wake of a corrupt
and self-serving organisation that had based itself there. Slowly,
though, the populace saw where Walden's policies were leading and
began to speak up, only to be quietly dealt with.

The revolution in 3265 finally saw the end of Walden's reign of terror
but saw [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] relegated to a backwater world too wrapped up in its own
troubles to amount to anything on the galactic stage. Its former
importance meant that [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] has becone a key tourist venue, with
numerous tributes to the GalCop era in terms of museums and artefacts.
