* Freelance Report: Could Halsey Shake up Federal Politics?

/22 Jul 3302/

Following the release of former Federal president [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] from the Clearwater Clinic, commentators from around the galaxy are asking the same question: What's next for Halsey? 

According to political analyst Emilio Blythe: "If Halsey were to return to politics, it could spell trouble for Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]]. Winters's leadership of the Liberal Party has been questioned over the last few months, and Halsey could conceivably retake control of the party." 

Meanwhile, members of the religious cult known as The Hands of the Architects are holding onto the hope that Halsey will take on the mantle of prophet, and lead them to 'communion with the Architects'. 

Attempts to contact the former president have been rebuffed by her staff.
