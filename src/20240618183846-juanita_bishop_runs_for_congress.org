* Juanita Bishop runs for Congress

/31 Aug 3304/

Juanita Bishop, a leading campaigner against the Far God cult, has announced that she is running for Federal Congress. 

Mrs Bishop’s vocal condemnation of Thargoid worship has gained her a strong following in many Federal systems. She is now campaigning to be elected to Congress as an independent candidate. 

At a rally protesting against the Far God sect, Mrs Bishop addressed the crowd: 

“I may lack political experience, but I care about protecting decent families from alien-loving deviants. If you elect me to Congress, I will make sure our leaders rid us of the Thargoid spies undermining our great Federation!” 

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune made this response: 

“Juanita Bishop is building her powerbase on the fear and paranoia that she herself has invoked. As has happened before, an innocent religion is being used as a scapegoat for society’s ills.” 

“We should be more concerned about the fact that Far God chapters are continuing to vanish without trace. If they are under threat, it is our duty to offer protection. These people are not aliens but citizens with legal rights, despite Bishop’s efforts to dehumanise them.”
