* Xeno-Research Campaign Ends

/14 Feb 3305/

A campaign from the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] to build a [[id:4e827915-3759-4040-97d0-346eac70fb5e][xenological research]] centre has concluded successfully.  

Chief researcher Dr [[id:d5ca99a6-ded7-43fb-bc1e-83a622b49c50][Roy Casimir]] told the media: 

“Thanks to [[id:f38f6f14-2b32-4ace-b352-41a5bac00d32][Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int]] we now have sufficient materials to build a planetary outpost where our scientists can study [[id:01ddb7a3-3a00-4fa6-b3b0-7dcdf01be1b2][lifeforms]] identified by the galactic community.” 

“We are also grateful for the exploration data provided by many pilots, which will help us create a new research catalogue.” 

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from [[id:e7277813-d4d3-496c-8fe5-e5f540ff5ef3][Williams Vision]] in the [[id:3efd571e-0167-4167-bf6c-67b4650259ce][Nahuaru]] system.
