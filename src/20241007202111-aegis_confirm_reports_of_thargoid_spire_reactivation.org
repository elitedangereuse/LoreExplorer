* Aegis Confirm Reports of Thargoid Spire Reactivation

/01 Aug 3310/

Pilots engaged with Thargoid forces around Titan Thor have reported unexpected activity from previously dormant Spire sites. 

Renowned xenologist Professor Shamus Madigan, part of the Federal delegation to Aegis, offered this update: 

“This morning, our operatives verified multiple claims of energy readings from two inactive spire sites. It appears that the Thargoids have restarted industrial efforts at these locations.” 

“It’s possible that the aliens have developed a method of cleansing the spires of our sabotage compounds. The spires’ internal functions may have been repurposed by other means. What we know, however, is that further contamination of these sites will be needed to shut them down for good.” 

In addition, AX fleets on the front line around Titan Thor also confirmed the withdrawal of Thargoid fleets from several unpopulated systems in the area. Madigan noted that Aegis’s ‘special advisor’, Seo Jin-ae, believes the relocation of these forces and the reactivation of these spire sites is not coincidental. 

The two reactivated spire sites are located in the following systems:
