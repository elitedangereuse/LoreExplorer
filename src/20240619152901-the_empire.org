* The Empire
** Introduction

#+begin_quote

  "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason, how infinite in
  faculty! In form and moving, how express and admirable! In action how
  like an angel, in apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the
  world. The paragon of animals!"

  --- Shakespeare, Hamlet

  "When our ancestors departed Earth, they asked themselves: which of
  our achievements represents the best of humanity, that we may bring it
  with us to illumine the darkness? The Federation, embroiled in a world
  of contracts and petty bickering, chose their Constitution. They
  placed their trust not in man himself, but the imperfect work of
  man."

  "But my ancestor -- your first Emperor -- was wiser. He knew that the
  best achievement of humanity was humanity itself. There was more
  wisdom in a single nucleotide of his noble DNA than in all the
  Federation's written texts."

  "That same wisdom still guides us now. We need no dusty documents to
  assert our right! We are human, born to rule... and the universe
  awaits the firm hand of our governance."

  --- Emperor Trasken Duval II, undelivered draft speech written
  immediately before his sudden and unexplained death

The Empire, while younger than the Federation, is the easily the equal
of its historic rival in terms of scale and resources. The key social
distinction between the two powers is that slavery in the Empire is
legal -- a fact that has remained a source of controversy since its
inception, both within the Empire and without. Some observers have
pointed out, however, that conditions for those at the lowest levels of
Federal society are worse than those experienced by Imperial slaves.

The popular image of the Empire is one of opulence, but while pomp and
pageantry may be the norm in the core Imperial systems, elsewhere in
Imperial space one can find myriad examples of deprivations and squalor.
Indeed, the Empire encompasses many striking contrasts: sophisticated
technology exists alongside and ancient Roman system of government, and
the affluence of the core worlds depends on often unregulated slave
labour in the wretched outer colonies.

Ruthless industrial efficiency and low taxation has made the Empire rich
and mighty. The hierarchy of Imperial society is rigid, but a Citizen
can always rise through the ranks if he or she becomes wealthy enough
and makes the right connections. Even a slave could, in theory, become a
Senator.

** History
*** The Achenar colony was founded.
In the mid 23rd Century, wealthy entrepreneur Marlin Duval was so
frustrated with the Federal government that she founded an independent
colony of her own in the Achenar system, chosen for its remoteness. When
Marlin was killed shortly afterwards in a flyer accident, her brother
Henson Duval took over as ruler.

*** Henson Duval the Emperor.
Duval immediately abolished the fledgling democracy that Marlin had set
up, and in its place he established a system modelled on ancient Rome.
He was now Emperor and his closest allies were his Senators. Any
colonists who might have objected were forced into silent compliance
with Duval's vision, such were his wealth and power. It was also widely
believed that Marlin Duval, like Remus in ancient Rome, had been killed
by her own brother. Nobody dared to speak out.

*** The mudlark extinction.
The colonists were aware that the planet they had settled, Achenar 6d,
had indigenous life, but at first it wasn't appreciated that this
included a sentient species, nicknamed the 'mudlarks' after they were
observed digging through riverbank mud in search of food. Although the
mudlarks were at a pre-agricultural stage of development, they appeared
to have developed the beginnings of language. They also created crude
forms in moulded clay with no obvious practical purpose, possibly
indicating a nascent artistic culture. The mudlarks proved fatally
vulnerable to the bacteria carried by the colonists, and within a few
decades of the colony's founding the species was extinct. Rumours
subsequently emerged that Henson Duval had purposefully removed all
traces of the mudlarks, partly in fear of Federal reprisal, and partly
to ensure that his development plans would not be hindered by ecological
constraints.

*** The Federation attempted to reclaim Achenar.
When the Federal government heard rumours that Duval's colony had
recklessly caused the destruction of a sentient indigenous species, they
decided on military intervention.

The Imperial ships beat back the Federal attackers, who were unable to
establish a beachhead among the airless outer worlds, and struggled to
maintain supply lines so far from Earth.

The Federal forces eventually fell back and entrenched in the Beta Hydri
system. Skirmishes with Imperial ships continued for the next fifty
years, but these were unable to prevent Duval from expanding the Empire
to many other worlds.

*** The age of expansion.
After hostilities with the Federation ceased, the Empire entered a
century of growth, annexing many new systems and persuading others to
join. It spent the following two centuries consolidating its new
territory, appointing colonial administrators from among the noble
houses of Achenar.

** Society
*** An ancient Roman model.
The Empire works on a 'cliens' system. Society is divided into tiers:
Emperor, Senators, Patrons, Cliens and then Citizens, with slaves below
these.

Groups of Patrons pledge their support to a given Senator, offering
military service, tax revenue and the right to wield the Patrons' votes
in the Senate on their behalf. In return the Patrons are granted a
measure of protection and material security, as well as having their
interests represented in the Imperial Senate.

Senators are responsible for deciding tax rates and welfare systems for
their Patrons, meaning that the lower a given Senator's tax rates, the
more Patrons he is likely to attract. This is far from being a Patron's
only concern, however -- loyalty over time, ideological compatibility,
family connections and discreet private deals can all play a part in
deciding which Senator to back.

The system extends downward through the tiers in a similar fashion, with
Clients pledging themselves to given Patrons, and Citizens pledging
themselves to given Clients.

The votes held by the Patrons actually comprise the total votes of all
the Clients pledged to them. Similarly, the votes held by those Clients
comprise the total votes of their pledged Citizens. Patrons are
therefore capable of investing variable degrees of power in their chose
Senators, with the result that some Senators are more powerful than
others. Senators are responsible for those below them, meaning that
everyone has a form of social security, at least in theory -- indeed,
many Senators take pride in the security they offer their Citizens. Some
have even been known to drain material wealth from small, independent
worlds and pump it back into the Capitol economy, allow them to reduce
Citizens' taxes, and giving their own popularity a considerable boost.

Patrons are free to withdraw their patronage from their chosen Senator,
placing the onus on the Senator to represent them satisfactorily or face
a loss of voting power.

*** Rigid strafitication.
The division between social classes formal, unambiguous and strict, but
there is a clear path to advancement. A person can pay a fee and
petition for admittance to the rank above. In this way, slaves can
become Citizens, too.

*** The law is not the same for all.
Senators have a responsibility to enforce the law, and they must obey
the Emperor's decree, but are otherwise above the law. A senator can
even carry out executions personally with little, if any, fear of
consequence.

** Military
*** The Imperial Navy.
Maintaining a modernized navy has always been a top priority for the
Empire. The ever-present threat posed by the Federation has driven
previous Emperors to empty the coffers again and again, for fear of
being outstripped in the arms race. More recently, funding has come from
wealthy individual Senators, many of whom are all-too eager to gain
influence within the Navy -- indeed, it has been claimed that
devastating planetary mining has been carried out in order to further
this cause.

The Facece system is arguably the most significant Imperial naval base.
Many officers are housed on the world of Topaz, while Peter's Wreck is
home to the training centres.

As well as the battle fleets, the Imperial Navy maintains a subdivision
dedicated to exploring the fringes of known space.

*** The Emperor's Own.
Genetic engineering is not officially tolerated in the Empire, but it
does sometimes take place. One notable example is the Emperor's Own, a
group of genetically engineered super soldiers deployed during the shock
invasion of Mansfield Colony in the [[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]] system in 2959. They proved
brutally efficient, overrunning the Federal defences in a mere two hours
and inflicting a rare defeat upon a Federal Gurkha regiment.

** Culture and Values
*** The human body represents perfection.
This belief, once held with near-religious intensity, still forms the
bedrock of the Empire's culture and morals. Genetic modification is
frowned upon, but a degree of 'genetic correction' is known to take
place, supposedly to correct defects such as vulnerability to certain
diseases.

The belief in the sanctity of the human body originates with the first
Emperor, Henson Duval. While he did not claim to be literally descended
from the Gods in the manner of Roman Emperors of old, he declared that
his won image was the paradigm to which others ought to aspire.
Households across the Empire were required to display a statue or bust
of the Emperor in a place of honour.

Imperial Citizens are therefore expected to shun habits that corrupt or
defile the human body, such as excessive indulgence in narcotics. The
ownership of slaves, by contrast, is tolerated in the same way that the
ownership of any beautiful work of art is tolerated. Mistreatment of
slaves is thus akin to vandalism. Keeping one's own body in peak
condition and adorning it with jewels and expensive cloths is not
vanity, but duty, and owning well-treated slaves is also considered a
sign of good character.

*** The Emperor's word is supreme.
The Emperor's successor is decided by the Senate, although the Duval
dynasty has such a strong powerbase that the Imperial throne has only
ever been occupied by members of that bloodline.

For generations, genetic selection ensured that the Emperor's hier would
be male, and the current ruler, Arissa Lavigny-Duval, is the first woman
to hold the throne. Marlin Duval is sometimes described as the Empire's
first female ruler, but this is incorrect -- the colony she founded was
a democracy.

*** Honour is everything.
The value placed on honour is a constant throughout all tiers of
Imperial society. Honour can be lost through various means, including
leaving debts unpaid, failing to respect a superior or provide for a
dependent, breaking a solemn vow, conducting combat with cowardly
weapons such as nerve gas, and defiling one's own body.

*** Slavery is acceptable, but slaves must be well
treated.
In the Empire, it is not uncommon for the poor and disenfranchised to
sign up for a period of military service in exchange for a small sum of
money. A similar logic applies to Imperial slavery, to the extent that
someone might sell themselves into slavery to clear a debt and restore
their honour. Selling oneself into slavery is a straightforward legal
process and results in a guaranteed sum of money for one's family, so it
is a popular option for the desperate. In practice, however, many find
that it takes much longer than expected to clear their debts.

People are also forced into slavery against their will. Sometimes, a
Senator will sentence a person of lower rank to be stripped of
citizenship and designated as a slave, but it is more common to impose a
fine of such magnitude that the Citizen has no recourse but to sell his
or herself into slavery.

Slaves may also be taken prisoner following a conflict, abducted from
their home, or even captured in a hijacking. While trading slaves is
lawful everywhere in the Empire except on Emerald, taking new slaves
outside of wartime is illegal without the blessing of a Senator.

** Diplomatic Relations
*** The Federation.
Resentement of the Federation runs deep in the Empire. The superpower is
remembered as an opporessive, interfering force that hypocritcally
avoids inflicting the slightest harm on nonhuman life, but thinks
nothing of forcibly imposing its values on its fellow humans, and
lacking the freedoms and social customs that the Empire values so
dearly.

While open hostility has frequently been the case in the past, the
current situation is one of grudging coexistence beneath which mistrust
simmers. Despite this antipathy, the Empire cooperated with the
Federation in a series of joint initatives against the Thargoids in the
early 3300s.

*** The Alliance.
When the Alliance was founded in 3230 following a bitter conflict with
the Empire and the Federation, multiple systems defected to it from both
superpowers. To the surprise of many, the Empire took very little
further retributive action, partly because of the ill health of the
Emperor of the time, and partly due to a belief that the defecting
systems would return to their 'natural home' sooner or later.

The Empire's current attitude is one of studied contempt. To recognise
it as a threat would be too much like showing respect.

*** Internal politics.
Unsurprisingly for a society so concerned with rank and influence, the
Empire contains a multitude of feuding power blocs. In particular, there
is a good deal of bad blood between the various noble houses, whose
values range from hardcore traditionalist to staunch reformist.

The Imperial Senate is no longer as overshadowed by the Emperor as it
once was, and has gained sufficient strength to act as a counterbalance
to the Emperor's poltical will. The individual character of the Emperor
still determines the Empire's overall direction, however, and the
suggestion that the Empire should evolve out of its old ways has proven
deeply divisive.
