* [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] Returns to the Federation

/20 Jan 3307/

Former President [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] has arrived on Mars to stand as a witness in the upcoming trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent. 

Halsey was subpoenaed by the Federal High Court to testify before the jury. Although this was not legally enforceable, since she now lives beyond the Federation’s jurisdiction, she has acceded to the court’s request. 

Jasmina Halsey served as Federal president prior to the destruction of Starship One in 3301, which Vincent is accused of arranging. She was recovered alive, but abandoned her political career and emigrated to the Alliance. She has since campaigned as a peace activist and acted as an adviser to Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]]. 

After greeting a large crowd of supporters at Olympus Village Spaceport, Halsey gave a statement to [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“This is a bittersweet moment for me. Coming back to the Federation feels like revisiting a past life. But perhaps we can finally lay some ghosts to rest.” 

She was welcomed in person by Shadow President Felicia Winters, who was secretary of state in Halsey’s administration. However, President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] has made no comment regarding his predecessor’s return or the forthcoming trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent.
