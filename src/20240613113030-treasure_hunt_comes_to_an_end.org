* 0696 Treasure Hunt Comes to an End
[[id:134496ca-2931-43f7-bf83-37cb99b29345][Algol]]

On March 29th 3302 the treasure hunt organized by billionaire
philanthropist [[id:67bd2189-aa99-45c2-902f-7db26bc2d2e3][Alfred Jeffress]] has come to an end, with a pilot by the
name of Commander [[id:2e745b95-9140-42ed-8daf-8d09561262c9][Oriza]] claiming victory. Thousands of people took
part in the competition, but ultimately there could only be one
victor.

As with Jeffress's previous [[id:726f441f-49b7-4ee2-997d-9223b17d7af8][treasure hunts]], competitors were required
to solve a series of [[id:b12c7a72-4c0f-4a3a-abe7-4b82cb9a54ce][riddles]] to find the mystery object at the centre
of the search - a [[id:23f66b0e-9198-4dc8-a11c-fea8851e4e6d][relic]] from [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]]'s past. The clues took pilots to
[[id:ffe1b4a6-2351-4c17-a8e1-a82da862ab90][Persephone]] in the [[id:55628bb2-5f97-4086-b281-170acff0bf9b][Avalon]] system, then to [[id:ab473669-dc56-4982-a190-56b1ebf825f9][Arrhenius Terminal]] in [[id:b15dad66-edf2-4c19-b7bf-987470cf62c5][Bard]]
and finally to the [[id:134496ca-2931-43f7-bf83-37cb99b29345][Algol]] system.
