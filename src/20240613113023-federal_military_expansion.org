* 0688 Federal Military Expansion
[[id:acffcea9-44ae-4689-8bc9-74f65c75e0ae][HIP 17225]]

On July 28th 3302 the [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]] ignited controversy with its decision
to establish a series of outposts in the [[id:cd15e78b-89d1-4051-bd92-05d0ab49ec17][Pleiades]] sector. The
development triggered a decisive response from [[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Empire]]-aligned pilots,
who made repeated attempts to destabilise the campaign. Ultimately,
the Federation was able to complete the operation, but the
Federation's opponents had made their feelings clear - the
superpower's military expansion would not proceed unopposed.
