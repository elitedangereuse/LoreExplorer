* Galactic News: Third Aegis Campaign Concludes

/13 Oct 3303/

Aegis has announced that the third phase of its campaign has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Huge quantities of material were delivered to Vonarburg Co-operative over the past week, which will be used to develop new anti-Thargoid technologies. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Aegis’s Head of Research, Professor Alba Tesreau, released the following statement: 

“I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who supported this initiative. The materials you delivered are already on their way to our engineering contractor, and the resultant device should be available soon.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vonarburg Co-operative in the Wyrd system.
