* Independent Colonisation Support Campaign Goes Live

/20 Feb 3311/

*[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots’ Federation]] ALERT*

[[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]] has issued a request for deliveries to [[id:faf9f2db-59ba-4940-85a2-9ce921f99de2][Starlace Station]] in the [[id:33b581d0-b31c-4177-9e70-9b478ad70e34][Minerva]] system.

[[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer]] COO [[id:9b2b1a6d-3645-4776-aeee-4e2db897b988][Mark Rennik]] is overseeing the second open request by the
corporation in a month, following calls for system survey data earlier
this month. Rennik’s press release, published through most major news
feeds, offered an update on Brewer’s broader colonisation plans.

An excerpt highlighted by [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“A key feature of independent colonisation plans is the [[id:c124b3bf-0b44-489b-8933-860b15b7d49e][beacon]] and
suite module used to establish a successful claim. Our secure
manufacturing facilities across several systems have been producing
considerable stocks of these devices ready to supply outfitters.”

“This morning, we held talks with representatives of minor factions on
the fringes of populated space. It was suggested – and we agreed -
that the initial colonisation efforts carried out with Brewer
technology could benefit from mobile market support.”

“I have therefore commissioned new additions to the [[id:454c41b7-95ca-4e7e-94d4-c8a3f9d61d0e][Trailblazer]]
megaship fleet, which will aid in supplying early colony claims. To
ensure these megaships are ready for service and sufficiently stocked
on time, we call for independent traders to bring specific commodities
to [[id:33b581d0-b31c-4177-9e70-9b478ad70e34][Minerva]] so we can meet our planned two-week deadline.”

A number of commodities have been requested by Brewer Logistics, the
logistical arm of Brewer Corporation, which are detailed within the
initiative. Following a recent security incident, a secondary
initiative to protect traders in the Minerva system is also underway,
with contributions measured in bounty vouchers.
