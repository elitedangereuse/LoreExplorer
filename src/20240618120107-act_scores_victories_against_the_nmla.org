* ACT Scores Victories Against the NMLA

/06 Sep 3307/

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has reported progress in its efforts to eliminate the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army. 

Captain Milo Castile, one of ACT’s joint leaders, told a press briefing: 

“The recent civil war in the Marlinist Colonies was a tragedy, of course. But many pro-NMLA individuals were exposed during the conflict. Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the newly elected leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, has cooperated fully in rooting out extremists from his faction.” 

“As a result, our agents have successfully raided dozens of NMLA cells and arrested several thousand paramilitary activists. We also acquired intelligence leading to hidden assets in multiple systems.” 

“I can confirm that [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]] – as the NMLA’s de facto leader calls himself – personally directed the Marlinist starport attacks. Unfortunately, we have yet to confirm Theta Group’s current whereabouts. The threat of further bombings cannot be ruled out.” 

“The NMLA has also been seriously impacted by the death of Aaron Whyte and the failure to elect a Neo-Marlinist prime consul. Without the legitimacy of a political wing, I believe the terrorists will find it much harder to recruit new allies.”
