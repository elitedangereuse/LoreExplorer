* ACT Scores Victories Against the NMLA

/06 Sep 3307/

The [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][Affiliated Counter-Terrorism]] unit has reported progress in its efforts to eliminate the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army. 

Captain Milo Castile, one of ACT’s joint leaders, told a press briefing: 

“The recent civil war in the Marlinist Colonies was a tragedy, of course. But many pro-NMLA individuals were exposed during the conflict. Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the newly elected leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, has cooperated fully in rooting out extremists from his faction.” 

“As a result, our agents have successfully raided dozens of [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] cells and arrested several thousand paramilitary activists. We also acquired intelligence leading to hidden assets in multiple systems.” 

“I can confirm that [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]] – as the NMLA’s de facto leader calls himself – personally directed the Marlinist starport attacks. Unfortunately, we have yet to confirm Theta Group’s current whereabouts. The threat of further bombings cannot be ruled out.” 

“The [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] has also been seriously impacted by the death of Aaron Whyte and the failure to elect a Neo-Marlinist prime consul. Without the legitimacy of a political wing, I believe the terrorists will find it much harder to recruit new allies.”
