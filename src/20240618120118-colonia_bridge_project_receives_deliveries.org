* [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge Project Receives Deliveries

/14 Oct 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Twin initiatives in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] systems have procured materials to construct new dockable megaships. 

Brewer Corporation made an announcement regarding its [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge project: 

“A positive response has led to generous shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units being received. As a result, Brewer Corporation can now commence work on enhancing the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region.” 

“Thanks to the dedication of the galactic community, 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge route by the 28th of October. These will serve as stationary ports, providing vital facilities for travellers. Planning is already underway for the second phase of this project, placing further megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and Colonia systems.” 

“Payment for contributing pilots is now available at Macdonald Settlement in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] system and [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] system. Both starports also offer a temporary discount on purchasing and outfitting to owners of our Drake-class Carriers.” 

Brewer Corporation will soon be reaching out to the top ten pilots from both the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] initiatives, to provide naming suggestions for the dockable megaships being placed on the route to Colonia. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.
