* Empire Ousted from [[id:73e31493-0c88-4fd7-9f49-9f3f1c92db41][Facece]] System

/20 Jan 3302/

Recent reports indicate that an independent faction known as the Allied [[id:73e31493-0c88-4fd7-9f49-9f3f1c92db41][Facece]] Order has wrested control of the Facece system from the Empire. Details are scarce, but it is believed that the Allied Facece Order took control of the system after achieving several strategic victories against Imperial Naval forces. Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]], who was until recently the system's primary administrator, was approached for comment: 

"I want to assure the people of [[id:73e31493-0c88-4fd7-9f49-9f3f1c92db41][Facece]] that the current state of affairs is only temporary. The Facece system will soon return to Imperial control, and the rebels who have undermined our authority will be made to answer for their crimes."
