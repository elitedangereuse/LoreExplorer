* Community Goal: Establishing a Base in Eol Prou

/28 Jul 3302/

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has launched a campaign to establish a planetary outpost in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. According to the organisation's spokesperson, the primary purpose of the new outpost will be to support independent trade and exploration in the region. 

In a statement, the spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign: 

"Well, the arrival of Jaques triggered a real surge in interest in Eol Prou. And since the system is pretty remote, there's a clear need for an outpost to support pilots ferrying material to and from the starport. That's in the short term. There's also a desire among the galactic community to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou, so hopefully this campaign will be the start of something bigger." 

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has placed an open order for mined osmium for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver materials to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for four weeks.
