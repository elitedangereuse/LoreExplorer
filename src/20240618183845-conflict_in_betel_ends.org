* Conflict in Betel Ends

/31 Aug 3304/

Authorities in the Betel system have confirmed that the conflict between the Silver Creative Network and Betel Free has come to an end. 

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately there could be only one victor. 

General Hollis of Betel security had this to say: 

“Now this feud has been resolved, we will hopefully see a period of prolonged peace in the system.” 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Amphipolis in the Betel system.
