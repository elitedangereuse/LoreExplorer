* Celebrations in Sol for Federal Election

/05 Oct 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A series of public events to celebrate the forthcoming presidential election are being held in the Sol system. 

Congress approved a request by President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] to finance a range of festivities, concerts and shows across the home system of the Federation. 

Billions of people are expected to attend, leading to a request for supplies of Crystalline Spheres, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Indi Bourbon, LTT Hyper Sweet and Pantaa Prayer Sticks to be delivered to Li Qing Jao starport in orbit over planet Earth. Congress also agreed to authorise a temporary two-week permit for all Pilots’ Federation members to access the Sol system. 

President Hudson announced the events across all Federal news channels, where he said: 

“Now we approach the time, as determined centuries ago by the Federal Accord, of our civilisation’s most profound tradition: the peaceful transfer of power. I have been deeply honoured to serve as your president for the past eight years. And you, the people of the galaxy’s largest ever democracy, deserve to celebrate all that we have accomplished together.” 

Vox Galactica’s political journalist Conrad Sterling observed: 

“This is clearly a high-profile attempt to boost public morale, one that allows President Hudson to leave office on a positive note. Political critics are viewing it as a way to distract the citizens from the prolonged Thargoid war, the recent Rackham scandal, and various other challenges besetting the Federation. But the eagerness of most citizens to embrace the sentiment proves one fact remains true: everyone loves a party.” 

Voting will open next Thursday for Federal citizens to choose either Vice President Jerome Archer or Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] as their next president. The election winner will be announced at the start of the following week.
