* Superpowers Discuss Unified Anti-Xeno Fleet

/28 Oct 3308/

Ambassadors of all three superpowers have held emergency talks following the California nebula attacks, with a united military fleet the primary topic. 

Political journalist Conrad Sterling provided this report for Vox Galactica: 

“The public demand to address the evolving Thargoid threat has led to key military personnel suggesting that the Allied, Federal and Imperial naval fleets could work in concert for the duration of the war. This once-inconceivable notion seems more plausible following the coalition in HIP 22460, despite the regrettable outcome of that operation.” 

“Sources have confirmed that Admiral Rachel Ziegler sought to contact Admiral Maxton Price directly, to discuss ways in which the Alliance Defence Force and Federal Navy might collaborate. Others have openly supported the idea of ‘a glorious grand armada to wipe out the alien hordes,’ as Vice Admiral Juno Rochester phrased it.” 

“However, there has been little in the way of political enthusiasm, with neither the Assembly nor Congress willing to debate the topic. Many leaders had their fingers burnt by aiding [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]], which could dissuade them from extending the hand of comradeship once again.” 

“And then there is the Empire, which lacks any interest in further collaboration with outside governments or organisations. While the Emperor pursues her new path of Imperial isolationism, the Imperial Navy’s might cannot be relied upon to protect Allied, Federal or independent systems from Thargoid attack.” 

“Nevertheless, the prospect of resurrecting the anti-xeno agency Aegis continues to gain traction. Professor Tesreau’s recent symposium outlined plans for a new incarnation that would avoid the mistakes of the past. Even if we never see a grand human armada, the call for unity could manifest in a number of other ways.”
