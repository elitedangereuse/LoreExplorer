* Galactic News: Enigmatic Message Received

/28 Aug 3302/

News feeds throughout the galaxy have received a mysterious message from an as-yet undetermined source. 

The message, which is reprinted in full below, appears to contain an oblique reference to a particular location, but the nature of the communiqu√© makes it hard to determine exactly what it refers to. 

"We've found something. Something incredible. Something the whole galaxy will want to see. The [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]]." 

"We could show it to you, but that wouldn't be much fun. So instead we're going to play a little [[id:34beeb4b-d68a-4b7e-b004-c43e2ee38f79][game]]." 

"It begins on the 28th. We'll be waiting for you." 

The [[id:0ba9accc-93ad-45a0-a771-e26daa59e58f][Federal Security Service]], aware that the message will pique the interest of the galactic community, said: 

"Frankly, I suspect this is some kind of hoax, but there will inevitably be some who attempt to unravel the [[id:670fd57f-e401-49b3-9d19-e8463934768f][mystery]]. All we can do is urge them to exercise caution."
