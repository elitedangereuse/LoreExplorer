* 0148 Governor Santorini's Assassination
[[id:da11b7b5-2c5a-4f17-9cd4-ce28a2f34dbd][Tau Ceti]]  

In 3098 Governor [[id:9492a08d-0edc-46db-969f-dc8670665346][Santorini]] of Tau Ceti was assassinated. Popular
Federal press sources pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several
quotes from 'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an
imperial target. Unusually, the Emperor elected to make a personal
rebuttal of the accusation, but three years later, Imperial colonists
escorted by Imperial warships, settled on [[id:465800ad-1e27-44fa-9b4b-5ca23bcc36ce][Emeral]]. The Federation
responded by sending Admiral O'Biren with a heavily armed battlegroup,
who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over the next
thirty years, botn sides would battle to gain control of the planet
and the system.
