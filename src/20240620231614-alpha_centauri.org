[[id:ba86a2db-c17e-4856-9882-036f95a773c2][Eden]] was the first planet on which liquid water was detected by
spectroscopic methods in 2038, and so it was a major driving force for
the exploration of space. However, Eden turned out to be extremely
inhospitable with the added danger of hard radiation from
Proxima. There is now a small research station on Eden, but little
else in the rest of the system. Star was once known as Rigel
Kentaurus.

Late in 3301 a rag-tag collection of Independent Commanders selflessly
came to the aid of Hutton Mug Co. to help kick-start the creation of
the [[id:56b510cd-e1c0-4183-845f-397475330ab2][Hutton Mug]]; the rare item that can only be found at Hutton Orbital
in the Alpha Centauri system. Over 2.4 million tonnes of scrap were
delivered by the Truckers, all the while evading and eventually
confronting the many concerted attacks by pirates and other
Ne'er-do-wells who blockaded the platform, determined to block the Mug
Companies[sic] efforts. In the aftermath of the famed Mug Run many
intrepid commanders decided to formalise their association to the
Co-Operative, vowing to protect the hallowed route and, perhaps one
day, find a cure for [[id:46bf843d-4f3a-43c9-99a4-75999d94f368][MODS]].
