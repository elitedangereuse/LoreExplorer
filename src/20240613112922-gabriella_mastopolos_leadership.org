* 0221 [[id:7344d4cd-7b21-4aa2-895b-98a4acefe96f][Gabriella Mastopolos]]' Leadership
[[id:7d12ffc5-6340-4b45-8c32-d63af1e5cbf1][Enayex]]

[[id:7344d4cd-7b21-4aa2-895b-98a4acefe96f][Mastopolos]] has recently lost out to Wreaken Mining and Construction
over the Tantalum extraction rights in [[id:35ef7825-95ca-418d-9cc2-9e7934b351c9][Tiliala]]. They have, however,
taken over administration of Jenning's Hollow in [[id:7d12ffc5-6340-4b45-8c32-d63af1e5cbf1][Enayex]], where
Imperial prisoners operate Tantalum mines. There were some concerns
over the Corporation's ability to manage the unruly prison workforce,
but following a direct presentation by Gabriella herself, conditions
improved dramatically.

Mastopolos Mining has grown to be a major mining force, particularly
in Imperial space, occasionally competing directly with [[id:acc63f52-1101-4a91-8a47-9f52c9f74540][WCM]]. It has
its own force of loyal slaves who are treated very well according to
Imperial rules (something that [[id:7344d4cd-7b21-4aa2-895b-98a4acefe96f][Gabriella Mastopolos]], now in her 90s,
widely insisted upon, and regularly visits installations to do
personal spot checks). Slave leave at the end of their assigned terms
with a generous bonus (calculated based on their productivity during
their term), over and above their required payout under Imperial
law. This means the workforce work hard and diligently - and also
increases the number of people signing up for such service.
