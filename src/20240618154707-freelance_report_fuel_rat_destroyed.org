* Freelance Report: Fuel Rat Destroyed

/07 Jun 3302/

A flight recording has surfaced revealing the destruction of a Fuel Rat rescue vessel. 

Two Fuel Rat pilots responded to an emergency call and refuelled an apparently stranded Python. One Fuel Rat jumped out of the system, but the Python pilot made his move before the second could follow. The footage shows that the attack was swift and came without warning, and resulted in the destruction of the Fuel Rat vessel. 

The attacker claims to have been collecting a bounty set by another Commander, who has denied the claim. Regardless of the ultimate [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]], both pilots have since been the target of manhunts. The long-term consequences of this incident remain to be seen.
