* Hudson Contravention Sparks Federal Protests

/22 Feb 3308/

President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]]’s proposal to remove the eight-year limit on his term of office has led to public unrest on many Federal worlds. 

Supporters of Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] have taken the lead in protesting against the Hudson Contravention, which is currently being debated in Congress. 

The situation has been extensively covered by newsfeeds across the Federation:  

Federal Free Press: “As always, [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] is the only grown-up in the room. She has rightfully objected to the sitting president’s attempt at throwing away the rulebook. Repealing the 77th amendment would be a fundamental blow to our millennia-old democracy.” 

Sol Today: “What’s the choice here? Retain Hudson for a few more years until things calm down, or hand power to Winters and watch the Federal government weaken and collapse under a weight the shadow president cannot possibly bear?” 

The Federal Times: “Moderate Republican voters are taking a dim view of the Hudson Contravention, primarily because it denies them the option to choose a new administration. Vice President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]], Secretary of State Lana Berkovich and Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa are the most likely presidential candidates, but none of them will be able to run for office in 3309 if Hudson gets his way.”
