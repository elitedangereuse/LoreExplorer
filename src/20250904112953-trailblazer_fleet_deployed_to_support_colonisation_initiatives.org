* Trailblazer Fleet Deployed to Support Colonisation Initiatives

/19 Mar 3311/

The [[id:454c41b7-95ca-4e7e-94d4-c8a3f9d61d0e][Trailblazer fleet]] announced by [[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]] last month has
been deployed to strategic locations on the edges of the core systems.

Described as ‘[[id:d1f19609-fdb7-4991-bcb2-e93435f013d0][colonisation]] support hubs,’ the Trailblazer fleet
provides a bespoke trade market focused on colonisation materials and
goods. The first wave of independent colonisation efforts has been
described as ‘overwhelmingly popular’ by Brewer COO [[id:9b2b1a6d-3645-4776-aeee-4e2db897b988][Mark Rennik]].

The fledgling public arm of Brewer’s claim management service has been
inundated with requests, and Rennik confirmed that the number of
claims had proved challenging. “The speed at which new systems have
been settled and expanded is frankly astonishing,” Rennik said in a
recent interview, “and I'm delighted that so many pioneers have taken
full advantage of this opportunity.”

The Trailblazer fleet has been deployed to the following star systems:

Trailblazer Dream - HIP 90578

Trailblazer Song - Orgen

Trailblazer Wish - Bletii

Trailblazer Star - 34 Omicron Cephei

Trailblazer Promise - Klikis

Trailblazer Faith - Ngobe

Trailblazer Echo has returned to the Minerva system.
