Lakon Spaceways is a starship manufacturer specialising in sturdy
vessels for cargo haulage and deep-space exploration. They have a longer
pedigree than most other ship manufacturers, their first dedicated
transport vessel having been built on Earth in the 26th Century.

The company's early models were characterised by the fact that they
could be easily repaired away from port -- a quality that has been
retained to this day, despite the prevalence of affordable repair
services.

In 3303, Lakon entered into partnership with the Alliance to produce a
range of military ships in response to the emerging Thargoid threat. As
of 3304, this partnership has produced the Type-10 Defender, the
Alliance Chieftain, the Alliance Crusader and the Alliance Challenger.

Lakon vessels tend to garner both praise and derision for their
unpretentious, functional design, which is informed more by practical
concerns than aesthetic considerations. Those who champion the chunky
look of Lakon craft typically say that they prefer their ships to look
like ships, not abstract sculptures.
