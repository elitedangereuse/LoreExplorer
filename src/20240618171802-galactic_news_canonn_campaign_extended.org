* Galactic News: Canonn Campaign Extended

/13 May 3303/

The appeal from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group for materials for a new research vessel has received an unprecedented level of support. The organisation has therefore decided to extend its original targets. 

A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement: 

“The level of support from the galactic community is truly amazing. We have therefore decided to add new cash tiers to our campaign so we can bolster the ship’s specifications, and amass a quantity of material for the scientific voyages the Gnosis has been designed for.” 

“This also gives more of the community an opportunity to contribute to this historic campaign.”
