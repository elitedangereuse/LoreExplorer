* The Battle for Betel

/24 Aug 3304/

Recent reports from the Betel system indicate that an ongoing feud between the Silver Creative Network and the Betel Free has escalated into violence. 

General Hollis of Betel security issued the following statement: 

“After a lengthy period of peace, these factions are now determined to wipe one another out. As much as we want to subdue this conflict ourselves, we simply do not have the ships to stage an effective intervention.” 

With system security forces stretched thin, both organisations are seizing the opportunity to settle old grudges, and have issued calls for support. Pilots who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction. 

The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 23rd August 3304.
