* 0502 Slough Orbital - The Cheese Wheel Bar
[[id:d1bba344-07ca-41d9-b03a-5981d697033a][Vesper-M4]]

Morbid true-crime tourists will enjoy the dark and moody ambiance of
this bar and fine-cheese dispensary, the scene of the most grisly
murder to happen in the system in living memory. The owner was found
dead, his head sawed in two by one of his own cheese slicers. No proof
of who, or what, committed the crime was ever discovered. The murderer
remains at large.

The murder was first reported in the [[id:46ebb909-bfc6-419c-a1bd-6378e0a2bfc7][Slough Observer]] by rookie
reporter, [[id:d6ad7f1e-30fc-4d3a-a2f1-a391d90bdf15][Jack Nova]].
