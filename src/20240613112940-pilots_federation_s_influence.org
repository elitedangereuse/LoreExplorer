* 0250 Pilots Federation's Influence
[[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Shinrarta Dezhra]]

Officially, the [[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots Federation]] is apolitical: as an organisation it
does not interfere with the internal workings of systems or
factions. However this official stance is a misnomer. The PF wields
considerable power through its web of political contacts as well as
the application of the bounty system and control of the ship and
station embedded systems.

It also uses a lot of soft power by providing pilot safety support
throughout human space.

There are also known cliques within the PF ([[id:7ec2457b-3e53-4928-a17f-e885b681b267][The Dark Wheel]] is probably
the most famous) that have their own agendas. Officially these are
discouraged, but in an organisation so large they are tolerated as
long as they don't overstep the mark.
