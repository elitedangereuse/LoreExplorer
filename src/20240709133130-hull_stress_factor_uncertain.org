THARGOID INVASION SHIPS 

Though most of the Thargoid Space Fleet is currently engaged by the 
Galactic Navy in Intergalactic Space, a few of the smaller battle shipsmake 
occasional sorties into Human Space. These ships are extremely fast for 
their size and invariably have ECM Systems (this was originally a 
Thargoid invention to counter Navy missiles, subsequently copied by the 
Navy from captured Thargoid ships). 

Additionally, most Thargoid battle ships carry a few small remote- 
controlled ships, each equipped with a single pulse laser. It is rumoured 
that the Galactic Navy are designing their own remote-controlled fighter, 
and will pay well for Thargoid ones to study.
