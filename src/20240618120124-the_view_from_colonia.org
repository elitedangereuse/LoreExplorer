* The View from Colonia

/29 Oct 3307/

[[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]’s culture correspondent [[id:27c93dec-0e9a-4f67-8a8b-c8ac0b1b2852][Lishan Abara]] looks at the
[[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region, the largest enclave of humanity outside the core
systems:

“Colonia. A place that few ever see, which exists following a computer
malfunction. The famed [[id:935880a2-d4fb-4d27-ad48-0f95112ee0fe][Jaques Station]] suffered a mis-jump on its
scheduled journey to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]], relocating some 22,000 light years
from [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]. The subsequent rescue effort led to the establishment of the
first permanent base in what is now considered a new frontier for
[[id:4dfd1a40-8f9b-4f66-9c90-971e253a3fe1][humanity]].”

“Over the last five years, courageous explorers have struck out to
inhabit several dozen local systems. This, in turn, invited a steady
stream of colonists seeking a fresh start. Nearly 13 million souls now
count this remote area as their home.”

“This is a place beyond the influence of the superpowers and
mega-corporations, and most residents prefer it that way. The [[id:6b6559fd-c7fa-44c9-b540-b94ddcadbd50][Colonia
Council]] works hard to maintain order, helping local organisations
function along cooperative lines. There have been a handful of
regional conflicts, but generally you’re less likely to witness
trouble out here.”

“Having become self-sufficient early on, Colonia’s healthy economy
encourages both traders and tourists to make the long journey. The
scientific community maintains a notable presence, a notable example
is the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]], which studies the many
vacuum-dwelling life forms found in the [[id:1d45a325-abf9-44b6-90d9-d91beebbdec1][Colonia Nebula]].”

“Independent and faction-aligned pilots are catered to, with [[id:35c576c0-0613-4e59-8291-96cbf61cc3ac][shipyards]]
and even a [[id:28dcc8eb-311b-416d-af66-5b9922625d6d][fleet carrier]] construction dock found in the area. Local
engineers such as [[id:e80652fd-7aa0-4b18-90ac-aebb3d1c2259][Baltanos]], [[id:44343fed-44fd-43ef-979a-27929ac198b9][Eleanor Bresa]], [[id:e543dd6e-96f5-4d65-a45f-32a5586ad511][Rosa Dayette]] and [[id:64af95e7-00c7-41ee-8205-100c0a7e0467][Yi Shen]]
also offer suit and personal equipment modifications to those who make
a living working on low-atmosphere worlds.”

“With the [[id:97a8c7e5-9399-4ebe-9457-8029ce809303][Colonia Bridge]] project well underway, it will soon be easier
than ever to cross the interstellar gulf and reach this distant
haven. Businesses, settlers and visitors alike may find themselves
increasingly drawn to the Colonia experience.”
