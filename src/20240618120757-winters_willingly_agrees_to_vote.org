* Winters Willingly Agrees to Vote

/29 May 3301/

Following Shadow President Zachary Hudson’s call to have Congress issue a Vote of No Confidence against President Jasmina Halsey, Acting President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] held a press conference outside Congress to address the Shadow President’s concerns about the future. 

“Let me start by saying how truly saddened I am by the loss of my long time friend, Jasmina. I know that were she here instead of me, she would be deeply disappointed with the fear-mongering being bandied about by members of the opposition. Nevertheless we have to bow to process.” 

“In order to allow a right and proper number of representatives from the frontier worlds to attend, Congress will meet on Monday to formally vote on the future of the Federation. Should I be chosen to continue to serve, I promise that you will get the kind of president that you deserve.”
