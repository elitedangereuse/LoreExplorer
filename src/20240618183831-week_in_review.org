* Week in Review

/12 Aug 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

A ship transporting former rear admiral Riri McAllister has vanished. McAllister, also known as Nexus, was on trial for her crimes as the founder of terrorist group the League of Reparation. While it is likely that the ship was destroyed by the League’s enemies, the possibility that McAllister was liberated by surviving members of the League has not been ruled out. 

Meanwhile, campaigner [[id:5fdbd5d4-1f5f-4984-8876-4bee1d590dd7][Jarl Toredo]] has resigned from Unchain, the anti-slavery organisation he founded with Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]. His resignation has prompted speculation about a possible disagreement between him and Duval, with commentators citing earlier rumours of a romance between the pair. 

The Federal Intelligence Agency has apprehended further members of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult, to determine if the sect is communicating with the Thargoids. Some see the arrests as tantamount to religious persecution, while others claim that the Far God worshippers have invited suspicion upon themselves, and that the detainments are justified. 

In other news, a malfunctioning mining robot has run amok through a settlement on Homeland in the [[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]] system. Sensor drones are now searching for the robot, which tunnelled underground after breaking out of its container. Security personnel are hoping to find the machine before it causes any serious damage. 

After sustained Thargoid attacks on civilian targets in the Pleiades Nebula, system authorities have launched a rescue operation to locate and recover survivors. Pilots have been asked to help with the operation, and also to contribute foods so those rescued can be adequately fed. 

Finally, a spokesperson for Aranbarahun Purple Creative has announced that its campaign to build a cargo ship has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Barnes Terminal and by eliminating agitators in Aranbarahun, thereby ensuring the safety of traders. 

And those are the main stories this week.
