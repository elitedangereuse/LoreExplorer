* Takeover of [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]] Declared Illegal

/10 Feb 3307/

The acquisition of [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]] by [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] has been revoked
following revelations of illegal activity.

An inquiry by the [[id:3433e961-0876-44ad-81e6-ac5111ea5e1b][Independent Commission for Market Equality]] stated
that former [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] CEO [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] “exerted unduly
influence on Lakon shareholders, including [[id:5d28c2d0-e5ac-4882-94e2-fb28bb874905][bribery]] and
[[id:f1778ba6-dab1-442b-88ff-1dfe06ee2616][blackmail]]”. This led to new appointees to the board of directors, who
were paid to approve the hostile takeover.

The inquiry also factored in the recent [[id:032a6bf8-b11f-4657-94bd-ca55d9b4adbc][Federal High Court]] trial,
which proved that [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] was directly responsible for the
destruction of [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]] in 3301. In both cases, he set up shell
companies to move enormous funds via unregistered banking systems.

[[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] refused to comment on the allegations, but its legal
team has terminated the transfer process. The entire corporation is
currently in disarray due to several departments becoming an
independent faction under the name [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]].

At [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]], [[id:88ac1950-caa0-4043-96c0-07e33ca7c049][Trent Delaney]] and several other directors have
resigned. During an emergency meeting, a majority of stakeholders
approved reinstating [[id:321b3694-38ea-481e-9899-77b5cb951f14][Naomi Landseer]] as chairperson.

With stock values plummeting and industry confidence low, the future
of the company remains uncertain. However, [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]
confirmed that it has made preliminary offers with regards to
acquiring Lakon as a subsidiary.
