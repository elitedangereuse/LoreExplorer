* Galactic News: Starport Campaign Reaches Successful Conclusion

/22 Dec 3303/

A spokesperson for the GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has announced that its appeal for construction materials has been earnestly received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge number of deliveries to Dervish Platform, the organisationâ€™s base of operations. The materials will be used to build a new Coriolis starport in the Ogmar system. 

The GalCop Colonial Defence Commission has offered sincere thanks to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dervish Platform in the Ogmar system.
