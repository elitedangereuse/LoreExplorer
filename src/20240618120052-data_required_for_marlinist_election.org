* Data Required for Marlinist Election

/15 Jul 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Rival candidates have requested deliveries of data to help secure their bids to lead the Marlinist Consulate. 

The Marlinist Colonies are voting for who will be elected as their prime consul. This influential role will diplomatically represent all Marlinists and make broad decisions on their behalf. 

The first candidate is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation Party, which is acting as the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] political wing. She has the support of Senator Lorcan Scordato to be made an Imperial patron: 

“I am in a unique position to finally provide our people with a voice in the Imperial Senate, and to speak for Neo-Marlinists. As prime consul, I will negotiate a permanent peace with the NMLA.”  

The second candidate, Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement, is focused on sustaining the Marlinist Colonies: 

“Neo-Marlinism and terrorism have no place within our republican ideals. I will strive to keep our systems independent, and to protect the rights of peaceful Marlinists everywhere.” 

In order to help secure their campaigns, both candidates have requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files. Shipments for Verity Dexter should be delivered to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system, while those for Kayode Tau are expected at Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.  

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have recognised the Marlinist Consulate as an ambassadorial body, and agreed that the election of its prime consul is a strictly internal matter.
