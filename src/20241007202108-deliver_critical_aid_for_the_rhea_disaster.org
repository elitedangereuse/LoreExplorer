* Deliver Critical Aid for the [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] Disaster

/11 Jul 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Federation has requested shipments of supplies in the [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] system to help rebuild critical infrastructure. 

Intense seismic activity across [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] 3’s largest continent demolished entire cities and townships late last year, causing widespread death and injury. Rescue operations have saved over a million people, but local infrastructure has been compromised and vital construction supplies are running low. 

President-Elect [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] spoke publicly for the first time since leaving for [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] 3 to announce a support initiative: 

“I know that there are individuals out there who have tried to use my absence from office to undermine the will of the Federation’s people by calling for a re-election. Of course they have. To them I say simply this: to care for your home planet, for your people, is not a weakness.” 

“But unfortunately, I have now reached the limit of what I can do to help through private channels, so I am humbly requesting the aid of our galaxy’s pilots. Please, provide crucial materials to support [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] 3’s recovery.” 

Federal Liberal Command, the controlling faction, has called for pilots to transport Power Generators, Aluminium, and Titanium to Ito Orbital in the [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] system. 

In related news, the formation of a new Federal government by the Liberal Party continues to be delayed with no confirmed inauguration in sight. Proposals for a re-election, or for President Hudson to remain in office for another term, have been rejected by Congress once again.
