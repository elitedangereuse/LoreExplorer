* Aegis Installation Campaign

/22 Jun 3304/

Aegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. 

An Aegis spokesperson gave the following statement to the media: 

“After the recent occupation of Socho by a hostile criminal element, it is imperative that Aegis bolster its holdings in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The construction of a military installation will allow us to continue our fight against the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] unhindered by external forces.” 

Aegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources, promising to reward pilots who deliver these to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 21st of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
