* Talk Show Murder Broadcast

/20 Oct 3308/

Channel 07 has intercepted footage of a violent attack on three talk show hosts, broadcast live on several Imperial newsfeeds.  

The show came to an abrupt halt after the three were apparently fired upon by an assailant who gained access to the enclosed set. The perpetrator managed to flee the building before security could intervene.   

Details on the status of the victims have not been provided, but first responders to the scene found a digital calling card pinned to the host’s dressing room door. Police have authorised the publication of the card’s contents, which consists of a single word: 

TFZIRQRL 

The word is thought to be encoded by a text cipher. It is hoped that by sharing the text, members of the public will be able to identify the perpetrator’s next move.
