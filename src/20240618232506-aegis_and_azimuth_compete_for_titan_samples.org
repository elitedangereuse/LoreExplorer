* Aegis and Azimuth Compete for Titan Samples

/15 Jun 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Requests for tissue samples obtained from the Thargoid Titans have been made by Aegis and Azimuth Biotech. 

Leon Banerjee, science correspondent for Vox Galactica, reported on the rival initiatives: 

“The Titans offer a tremendous opportunity for xenological research, but carry equally significant risks. These involve passing through the Maelstroms’ caustic clouds and energy barriers, avoiding Thargoid patrols, and escaping with tissue samples intact. Only the most determined pilots would undertake such missions, and the two leading anti-xeno organisations seek to attract these individuals with considerable payouts.” 

“There are numerous unique materials identified so far. In this campaign, both Aegis and Azimuth Biotech are looking to acquire a large stock of tissue samples. These are recovered using research limpets at various points on the Titan’s architecture, acquired from minor flaws in the Titan’s highly protective outer layers.” 

“Ships outfitted with a pulse wave xeno scanner and research limpet controller – or a suitable multi-limpet controller - can collect these materials. Aegis has developed its caustic sink launcher and Thargoid pulse neutraliser to pass through the Maelstrom, and will look to use further xenological resources in additional advancements. Azimuth Biotech, meanwhile, has vowed to use samples to develop ‘cutting-edge military countermeasures to Thargoid aggression’.” 

Pilots signed up to the Aegis initiative can deliver any Titan tissue samples to Wiberg Station in the Kioskurber system. Meanwhile, Azimuth supporters can deliver samples to Stebler City in the Djeriman system.
