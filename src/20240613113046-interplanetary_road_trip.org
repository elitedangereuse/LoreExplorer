In the early third millennium, a high-profile business magnate made headlines by launching a car into space. Although the launch was seen as a whimsical gesture, the vehicle itself soon acquired the status of a valuable cultural artefact. / Several hundred years later, a consortium of cultrual institutions lobbied to reclaim the car and place it in a museum. After an extensive period of bureaucratic wrangling, a mission was launched to recover the vehicle. / Unfortunately, when the mission reached its destination the car was nowhere to be seen. Its precise fate has never been determined, but the prevailing theory is that it was stolen by pirates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
