* Connection to Sirius Corp Uncovered

/16 Nov 3304/

A link has been established between the mercenary group recently intercepted in the Meene system and the Sirius Corporation. 

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force said: 

“With the vital assistance of the galactic community, we were able to apprehend several of the mercenaries. Interrogations revealed that a number of them were in fact junior officers in Sirius Corp’s private fleet.” 

“Other mercenaries confirmed that the attack was funded and organised by these individuals, which raises the question of why Sirius should be involved with this criminal enterprise.” 

The engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]], who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, commented: 

“Did Sirius really think it could obtain my research by force? Or was this an attempt to scare me into accepting [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]]’s offer?” 

A spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation refuted any allegations of criminal activity, and insisted there would be a full inquiry.
