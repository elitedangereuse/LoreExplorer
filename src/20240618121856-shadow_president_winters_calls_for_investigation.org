Shadow President Winters Calls for Investigation 
 
In a speech before Congress, Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] called for an open and thorough investigation into the allegations made in recent articles posted by the Federal Times: 

 "There is too much evidence here to be ignored. I knew Vice President Nigel Smeaton personally and he was a good friend - the thought that he was murdered for investigating the death of a family member is repugnant. Our society is one based on [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] and freedom and I call upon President Hudson to immediately instigate an impartial and open investigation into these allegations." 

Her speech was met with support from both sides of the political divide. There has been no response from the President's office as yet.
