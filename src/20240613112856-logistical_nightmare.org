[[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]]  

In the fall of 2323, the fleet journeyed from its staging area at Beta
Hydri towards the Achenar system over a period of several weeks. The
systems between Achenar and Beta Hydri were largely unexplored at the
time, with only a few embryonic colonies at the beginning of the
journey incapable of supplying the Federal fleet other than by
scooping fuel. This caused [[id:8e40b676-782d-4395-a409-beec9df1a338][Admiral Morgan]] considerable logistical
difficulties and forced him to move only as fast as the slowest ship,
with many turning back.

The fleet eventually arrived in the [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]] system at the start
of 2324. Morgan had anticipated resistance and judging his supplies of
fuel, he elected to confront the enemy on one decisive battle on the
edge of the system. He didn't have a great deal of choice. Smuggled
intelligence allow the defending forces to anticipate the arrival
position and the defenders were expecting a fight. What they hadn't
predicted was their enemy to use their pack hunting formation against
them.
