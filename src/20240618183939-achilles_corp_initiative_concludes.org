* Achilles Corp Initiative Concludes

/06 Dec 3304/

A goodwill initiative from the [[id:04ba4637-336a-46c7-bab0-3ac12f16b2f9][Achilles Corporation]] has now concluded. 

Chairman Gus Weaver of the Sol division of Achilles Corp announced: 

“Thanks to the dedication of many independent traders, we have now acquired enough commodities to manufacture replacements for all robots destroyed in the wake of the spy robot scandal.” 

“I’d also like to remind our customers that the illegal surveillance program was safely deleted by our latest coreware update. Remember, you can always trust Achilles.” 

The deliveries were organised by the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond, which also arranged to protect traders from attack. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Henslow Market in the Adenets system.
