* Destination: Humanity

/04 Nov 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

It has been confirmed that the mysterious anomalies known as rogue signal sources are all converging on the core systems. 

Professor Yaro Kenyatta , a noted academic in astronomy-related fields, has been collaborating with Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] and [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] on analysing the unexplained objects. He published a summary of their work in the scientific journal The Empirical:  

“The first of these distant objects was detected on the 31st of August 3308, but several more have since been identified. It was quickly apparent that they were travelling through interstellar space at faster-than-light speed. Full spectrum system (FSS) scanners were upgraded to allow more pilots to detect their electromagnetic emissions.”  

“Data on these phenomena has been analysed by many respected organisations such as Canonn Interstellar Research Group, Orion University and Universal Cartographics. Their consensus is that the rogue signal sources are all approaching the core systems, home to the vast majority of the human population.” 

“As yet, we cannot determine when and where they will arrive with complete certainty. But it now seems unlikely that these are naturally occurring stellar bodies. It follows that eight distinct anomalies converging upon our small region of the galaxy cannot be pure chance. Human space is their intended destination.” 

“What will happen when they arrive? Judging by their astonishing energy output, they may be devastating to inhabited systems. Each signal could be an energy projectile or a navigation beacon for some unknown force. More fanciful suggestions include celestial beings beyond our comprehension, or interstellar technology we have never witnessed. Our intention is to narrow down the more probable options soon.” 

“Alternatively, if these are hyperspace distortions caused by non-human vessels, it’s possible they may decelerate as they draw near. But one conclusion can be made: whatever they are, they must know we are here.”
