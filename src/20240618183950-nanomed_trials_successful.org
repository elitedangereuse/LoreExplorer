* Nanomed Trials Successful

/22 Dec 3304/

Clinical trials for new nanomedicines developed by Vitadyne Labs have delivered outstanding results. 

Observers from the Interstellar Health Organisation summarised: 

“Our teams carefully monitored the use of Vitadyne nanomeds on patients for whom conventional treatments were unsuitable. In all cases, the nanomedicines eliminated malignant cells, boosted immune systems and repaired damaged tissue.” 

“There is no doubt that this product represents a breakthrough in nanomedicine, with enormous healthcare potential.” 

Professor Katrien Rook, owner of Vitadyne Labs, told the media: 

“It’s highly gratifying to have our work validated in this way. I’m grateful to the IHO for its diligence, and I look forward to introducing our nanomedicines to the galaxy.”
