* Request for Pilots to Trace Distress Call

/28 Jan 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

An independent vessel has detected a fragment of a mysterious message coming from an unexplored region of space. 

Commander Elsa Solomon was travelling through the Swoilz XX-D c1-30 system when her ship’s communications array picked up a faint transmission. The message was as follows: 

This is an emergency broadcast on all frequencies from Serene Harbour. We are – 

The transmission ended abruptly and did not resume. The signal did not contain any identification data or indications as to its origin. 

Commander Solomon gave more details to Vox Galactica: 

“The message appeared in my comms panels as text and an electronically generated voice. I wasn’t able to determine a source, only that it was broadcast within 80 light years of that system. My schedule was tight so I couldn’t spend long tracking it.” 

“I have no idea if Serene Harbour is a starport, a settlement or even a megaship, but this is obviously a mayday signal. Someone somewhere is in serious trouble. I’ve asked the Pilots Federation to share the information in case any of my fellow Commanders can help.” 

To help triangulate the source, there is a callout to any other ships that were in the area at the time, which may have received a similar broadcast. However, no responses have been received as yet.
