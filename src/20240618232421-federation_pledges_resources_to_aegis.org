* Federation Pledges Resources to Aegis

/10 Feb 3309/

President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] and Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] have united behind Federal backing for the reformation of Aegis. 

Congress held an emergency debate after the Alliance and Empire agreed to support an official tri-superpower initiative against the Thargoids. A majority of votes from Republican, Liberal and independent representatives approved the provision of ships, personnel and materials from the Federation. 

President Hudson delivered a short address to mark the occasion: 

“The intensified Thargoid attacks against the core systems demand a proportionate response. We recognise that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] was directly responsible for many of the tragic events that Aegis was blamed for. The Federation has an opportunity to correct that misjudgement and do our part to defeat a common adversary.” 

Congressman Tom Gillespie has volunteered to coordinate the Federation’s involvement with any unified anti-xeno activities. Professor [[id:3af8bb5f-63d0-4a98-b172-dcbcb70b5a4f][Shamus Madigan]] of Olympus Village University will continue to lead on xenological research. The Federal Navy has assigned Rear Admiral Daniel Parry to act as its military liaison, a reduced version of the role formerly occupied by Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]]. 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] has publicly thanked the leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation for their “renewed faith in the ideals that Aegis represents”.
