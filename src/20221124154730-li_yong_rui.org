  "The fortune teller rattling bones in her simple hut, the smiling
  insurance salesman with his snakeskin briefcase and the data analyst
  with his interactive holographic model are all selling the same thing:
  certainty. One of the paradoxes of human existence is that we crave
  the freedom to be spontaneous, thinking it essential to our nature,
  while constantly seeking reassurance that nothing unexpected is going
  to happen. We flatter ourselves with the belief that we are exempt
  from the rules of modelling that govern the rest of the universe."

  --- Introduction to 'Becoming the Watchmaker', [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]]'s master's
  thesis on the innate human reluctance to accept behavioural
  predictability

Li Yong-Rui is the chief operating officer of the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation and
its governmental subsidiary, [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Gov. Like many other members of the
Li dynasty, Yong-Rui came to the corporate world from an academic
background, having achieved doctorates in multiple fields and
specialising in extrapolating potential future simulations from limited
data.

Although he is in many respects an innovator, Yong-Rui embodies the
archetype of the healthy, energetic corporate executive, with little of
the eccentricity that traditionally characterises visionaries. A good
deal of his popularity is attributable to his innate serenity and
outward conventionality.

Those who have worked under him describe him as radiating self-assurance
and giving the impression that everything is completely under control.
Yong-Rui has brought a similar sense of constancy to [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Gov, giving
the citizens under his governance the impression that they can trust
their government to do the right thing -- a rare achievement for any
administration.

Yong-Rui has stated many times that he does not believe in the concept
of chaos, holding that while order is objective, chaos is subjective;
since existence if fundamentally meaningful, any semblance of discord
can only be the result of the observer's own failure to discern the
underlying meaning.

Although some might mistake Yong-Rui's views for a form of mysticism, he
is a staunch materialist. He attributes his success in economics to his
insistence upon viewing the universe -- especially its human component
-- in clear and unsentimental terms. All human behaviour, he believes,
can be reduced to simple, quantifiable factors, ultimately predicated
upon enlightened self-interest. This approach, as well as being laudably
rational, allows for truly impartial government.
