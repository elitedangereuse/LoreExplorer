* Materials Received to Construct Duval Statues

/01 Sep 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A campaign by a minor Imperial Family member to deliver precious materials to [[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]] has concluded.  

The shipments of gold, jadeite and platinum will be used to construct statues of Duval family members, to be erected in public spaces in planetary cities across the Empire. 

The project is the brainchild of Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval, who announced: 

“I am deeply grateful to all the pilots who mined or transported the resources we required. Work has already begun to forge them into beautiful works of art, commemorating past Emperors and other noble holders of the Duval name.” 

“It is my honour to confirm the first two statues will be of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, located in the palace’s central plaza on Capitol, and of Lady Florence Lavigny, placed within the main square of Topaz’s capital city alongside the memorial sculpture of Emperor Hengist.” 

Laedla Empire Assembly is now offering payment to those who delivered the required materials to Kummer Acropolis in the [[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]] system. Bounty vouchers for all wanted ships destroyed within the system will also be redeemed.
