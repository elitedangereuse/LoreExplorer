* Week in Review

/12 Jan 3305/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

The Empire has entered a state of conflict with the isolationist group Nova Imperium in the Paresa system. Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] issued a call to Imperial auxiliaries to help destroy the Nova Imperium fleet. Imperator Mordanticus made a similar appeal, saying, “I urge all those who believe that Hadrian Duval should be the Emperor to support us.” 

A luxury star yacht belonging to famous actor Consuela Knight has reached its destination with nobody aboard. Computer records confirmed the crew's presence until a few minutes before arrival, when all five crew members vanished. Engineering and hyperspace experts have begun analysing data to unravel the mystery. 

Meanwhile, the Interstellar Health Organisation is reviewing Vitadyne Labs’s nanomedicines, which the company has admitted are based on advanced technology developed by Utopia. Many in the medical community have argued that Utopia should share their revolutionary medicines, but investors have already pumped millions of credits into Vitadyne Labs, convinced that profits will run into the billions if these nanomeds become the galaxy’s hottest new commodity. 

Finally, supply campaigns for the Federal and Imperial navies have concluded successfully, with traders delivering large amounts of military provisions. The factions responsible for the parallel initiatives thanked pilots who contributed. 

And those are the main stories this week.
