* The Master Chefs – Truth or Hoax?

/08 Oct 3301/

An [[id:ac2f36d3-c1f4-4f9c-9927-60f038fc2eca][anonymous]] [[id:4a79c439-6d04-4903-b5bc-dc883a04de3e][message]] has been delivered to a number of news feeds
claiming that [[id:914007b4-8ac9-4bfc-b6c3-a11b4f3e1756][clandestine]] [[id:283068fc-4194-4cae-8395-29f31d9cf0e4][genetic experiments]] are being carried out in
[[id:d8f9e754-4f57-4123-b488-118f0755df72][Noti]] system. The message, which was delivered in the early hours of
the morning, asserts that an [[id:a06c1fa2-d8bf-4bf3-8365-1c609a30fbd3][unnamed organisation]] has [[id:6ad7e1e4-4fb0-4cbf-b9a1-771afa67ed0b][secretly]] created
a new strain of [[id:11c82a20-33a7-444f-977c-0ea2f666c25b][slave]] labour. The full contents of the message are as
follows:

"I don't know what they're called – they hide behind various dummy
companies – but I know what they're doing. They target people that
match a specific [[id:0f39cd02-59d3-48b3-b931-972f0578ab45][genetic template]], and [[id:13784bf4-7aa3-4a7c-878f-5d1e5179cd3f][kidnap]] them when they're just
kids. Then they subject them to the most punishing, dehumanising
training imaginable. By the end of it, the subject is barely even
human. Their compassion and empathy have been completely hammered out
of them. All that's left is the desire to cook. They call these
creations...the [[id:f055b562-88b2-4eab-b160-18ac63d812a6][Master Chefs]]."

Is the message legitimate, or is it just an imaginative [[id:29abd7a3-0683-4dd8-9110-196356a9a19d][hoax]]? We leave
you to decide.
