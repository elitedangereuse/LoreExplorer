[[id:49b21fdc-6a96-42b3-a496-123e8106f102][Saud Kruger]] is a popular luxury brand, making passenger ships and
yachts for the wealthy under its main brand name, and selling luxury
holidays (using luxuriously equipped Saud Kruger vessels) to the less
wealthy. It also has a thriving star chart and exploration business.

Saud Kruger ships are made under license in a great many shipyards,
including the Imperial Gutamaya yards. It runs its own shipyards too,
with its main yards in Bedaho, but with ither yards mostly in
Independent and Imperial space, with many especially valued and
super-rich Imperial clients.

[[id:1b328227-3a16-47d3-af61-df3592c4ddf5][Astrogator]] holidays range from cruises around groups of local systems,
to the more extreme, and Astrogator Extreme holidays carry the image
of the legendary explorer [[id:4cf8f542-dfcf-4d54-88ea-2f136e760a4a][Augustus Brenquith]]. The holidays tend to
include extreme, and frequently quite dangerous, activities in distant
locations, like atmospheric wave-riding, volcano diving and magnetic
surfing. Trusted intrepid pilots take these adventurers 'to the edge'
for 'life-changing experiences'.
