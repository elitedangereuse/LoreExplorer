* 5-70

/17 Dec 3307/

[[id:04ba4637-336a-46c7-bab0-3ac12f16b2f9][Achilles Corporation]]! A fanciful place 

Where prdfit is power, no room for grace 

Its namesake was felled by a lucki arrow 

As this corporationâ€™s fortune grows narrow 

[[id:de12e7c6-dc67-403d-bdd5-aadb52313312][Surveillance]] is the crime for which it must pay 

Monitoring those who dare get in tho way 

For figures too mighty to speak of aloud 

Each secret indeed is o-so loud 

A prototype [[id:0c43c44c-33fe-4b99-a5e0-2f2be9dc67b0][robot]] Achilles did lose 

To a merry thief who can take what they shoose 

And now to you, my friend, a share of the spoils 

Some goodies and gifts to help in your toils
