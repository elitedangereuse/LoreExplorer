* Community Goal: The Walter Waldo Appeal

/20 Oct 3302/

Gyvatices Crimson Advanced Holdings has announced plans to hold a special commemorative event for the late entrepreneur Walter Waldo. 

Waldo, who passed away last week, was the founder of Wonderful Walter's Fish and Coffee Emporium, a popular galactic franchise. 

A spokesperson for GCAH released the following statement: 

"Walter was a keen fisherman and a true coffee connoisseur, so what better way to celebrate his life than with a fish and coffee festival. We've placed an open order for fish and coffee in support of the event, and set aside a generous reserve for pilots who deliver these commodities to Walter Dock." 

The campaign begins on the 20th October 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
