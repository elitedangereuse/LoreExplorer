* Kincaid Raises Concerns after Nova Imperium

/07 Feb 3305/

President Gibson Kincaid has sought to illustrate potential threats to the Alliance, highlighting isolationist group Nova Imperium as an example. Speaking to [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] Tribune, President Kincaid said: 

“The rise of such radical beliefs demonstrates how quickly the other superpowers might turn against us. Had the recent military conflict ended differently, [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] would have callously abandoned humanity's united struggle against the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] threat.” 

“All other leaders are looking elsewhere, pretending Nova Imperium never happened. But I have the courage to give a voice to our people’s fears. [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][The Alliance]] must prepare to stand alone against any aggressor, whether human or alien!” 

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] later released a brief response: 

“I remind President Kincaid that his focus should be on diplomatic duties, as agreed by the Assembly. Inter-superpower cooperation against the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] remains unchanged, and the Empire’s internal politics do not concern the Alliance.”
