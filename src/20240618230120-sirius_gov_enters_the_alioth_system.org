* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Gov Enters the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] System

/14 Jan 3308/

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has invited [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] to establish a permanent presence within the Alliance. 

The Alliance Tribune’s political correspondent [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] reported: 

“Sirius Corporation’s new role as a strategic defence partner has expanded swiftly, with a [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] faction established in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system to represent the megacorp. In addition, several megaships have arrived in other Allied systems to provide support.”  

“The [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] and some government departments now have official advisors from [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] on their staff. Prime Minister Mahon announced that these developments will streamline joint operations with the Sirius Navy, and in turn provide effective countermeasures against Thargoid aggression.” 

“But Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] claims that the presence of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Gov is illegal as it was not ratified by the Assembly. She has pointed out that since the defence pact makes this a classified military matter, any civil action to reverse Mahon’s executive decision has been deliberately blocked.”
