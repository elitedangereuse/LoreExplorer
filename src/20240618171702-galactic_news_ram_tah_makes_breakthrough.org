* Galactic News: [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] Makes Breakthrough

/13 Feb 3303/

Since the Synuefe ruins were discovered in October, hundreds of explorers, archaeologists and relic hunters have scoured the site for information about the race that created it. When engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] started researching the ruins, hundreds more joined the search, motivated either by a thirst for knowledge or by the promise of reward. 

Now, [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] claims to have made a significant breakthrough. In a statement, he said: 

"Thanks to the hard work of many dedicated pilots – and in particular Commander Noodlz05 and his wingmates – I have isolated a signal in the Guardians' monolith network that will allow scanners to identify sites within 1,000 light seconds. This should make finding further Guardian ruins considerably easier." 

"I would like to thank all those involved for their help. This was not an easy task, but together we have learned a great deal about the Guardians' fascinating culture."
