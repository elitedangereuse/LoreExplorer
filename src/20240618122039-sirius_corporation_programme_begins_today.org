* [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] Programme Begins Today

/05 Nov 3301/

Following a recent statement from [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] announcing its
intention to revitalise several newly acquired star systems, the
company has launched an initiative to boost the economy of
[[id:da376681-8c08-4409-9565-3b91330fce01][HIP 8396]]. At the heart of the initiative is a request for [[id:89bb247d-d459-4ebf-a000-698cd1d9c5fe][osmium]],
which [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp]] hopes will serve as a fillip for the system's
financial rejuvenation. [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]], the CEO of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]], was
quoted as saying:

"The people of [[id:da376681-8c08-4409-9565-3b91330fce01][HIP 8396]] are part of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] family, but
if we are to help our compatriots, we will need help ourselves. So I
implore all galactic citizens to contribute to this initiative, and
bring a new era of peace and prosperity to [[id:da376681-8c08-4409-9565-3b91330fce01][HIP 8396]]."
