* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation Programme Begins Today

/05 Nov 3301/

Following a recent statement from [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation announcing its intention to revitalise several newly acquired star systems, the company has launched an initiative to boost the economy of HIP 8396. At the heart of the initiative is a request for osmium, which Sirius Corp hopes will serve as a fillip for the system's financial rejuvenation. [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]], the CEO of the Sirius Corp., was quoted as saying: 

"The people of HIP 8396 are part of the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation family, but if we are to help our compatriots, we will need help ourselves. So I implore all galactic citizens to contribute to this initiative, and bring a new era of peace and prosperity to HIP 8396."
