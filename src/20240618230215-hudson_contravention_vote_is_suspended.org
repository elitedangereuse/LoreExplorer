* Hudson Contravention Vote is Suspended

/01 Apr 3308/

Federal Congress has temporarily postponed making a decision on whether to extend presidential term limits. 

President Zachary Hudson had proposed to repeal the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, which specifies that a president can serve for a maximum of eight years. If approved, Hudson would become eligible for re-election in June 3309. 

A statement was delivered by President Hudson: 

“I have agreed that more time is needed to analyse the potential repercussions of this change to the Federation’s constitution. A congressional subcommittee will perform a detailed inquiry to investigate the civil and legal aspects.” 

“In addition, I am very conscious of the public disturbances caused by the Hudson Contravention. This delay should help to defuse political tension and provide our security services with an opportunity to keep the peace.” 

Shadow President Winters welcomed the president’s decision, and spoke of her eagerness to read the subcommittee’s report.
