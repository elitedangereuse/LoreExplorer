Prime Minister Mahon Announces Open Trade Agreement in Old World Cluster 
 
During a press conference in Alioth earlier today, Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] expressed his gratitude towards the independent pilots who supported his initiative to strengthen the Alliance's economic presence in the Old Worlds cluster. Mahon declared intention to keep the cluster open for traders of all affiliations and has announced an open trade agreement that will grant any trader safe passage. 

To ensure the safety of trader ships in the sector, Prime Minister Mahon has commissioned the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] to establish a permanent presence in the sector, to counter the growing threats to civilian traders from piracy and crime. The deployment of this new Alliance strike force is expected to take place within the next few weeks.
