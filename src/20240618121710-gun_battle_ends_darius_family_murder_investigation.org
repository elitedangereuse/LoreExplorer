Gun Battle Ends Darius Family Murder Investigation 
 
The hunt for the killers of the Darius family came to a dramatic conclusion today in a firefight with local security forces on [[id:9fa174ce-7273-40ba-a0e6-1225bcda40b6][Eotienses]]. 

The Darius family was brutally murdered four days ago in what is believed to be revenge for Brendan Paul Darius’s assassination of Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]]. All of the suspects – who are understood to have been local vigilantes seeking revenge for the Emperor’s murder – were killed in the operation. In a statement, Inspector Reeve, who led the investigation, said: 

“Considering the savagery with which the suspects butchered the Darius family, we couldn’t take any chances while attempting to arrest them. They were heavily armed and opened fire as our officers entered the building.” 

He refused to answer questions about why the family wasn’t in protective custody, or how the protection team were able to be subdued so easily. One local witness of the operation claimed that no attempt was made to arrest the suspects, an accusation Inspector Reeve vigorously denied.
