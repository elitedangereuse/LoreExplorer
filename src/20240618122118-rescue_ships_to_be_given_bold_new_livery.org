* Rescue Ships to be Given Bold New Livery

/29 Nov 3301/

A joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] has
resulted in a distinctive new colour scheme for search-and-rescue
vessels. The livery has been designed to assist with the instant
recognition of friendly rescue ships, thereby minimising unintentional
attacks and soothing the nerves of those in need of rescue.

The unique colour scheme was created by a member of the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]]
Mischief, an auxiliary of the celebrated volunteer-run rescue
service. The designer, who goes by the name of Commander [[id:d79dfbe7-c2e6-46ae-9019-704c22e4199d][Father Cool]],
originally intended the livery to be used by the Fuel Rats, but
ultimately the Pilots Federation decided it would be more suitable as
a colour scheme for dedicated search-and-rescue vessels.

The new paint scheme will soon be seen on search-and-rescue ships
throughout inhabited space.
