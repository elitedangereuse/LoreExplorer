* Colonia

  "We were in a tight spot, and people came through for us without even
  being asked. That's what people do. It didn't hurt that the whole idea
  was flat-out crazy, of course. That just made them more determined."

Colonia lies some 22,000 light years from the core systems, and was the
first system in the Colonia Nebula to be settled by humanity. The
circumstances of Colonia's founding are highly unusual: the system was
colonised as a result of the spontaneous actions of independent pilots,
rather than through a formal expansion programme.

The colonisation of Colonia began with an accident involving Jaques
Station, a jump-capable [[id:d5cc8c3e-9887-4c30-9a1d-08008ab36675][Orbis]] starport. In May 3302, the station
executed a long-distance jump to Beagle Point, but when it failed to
reach its destination it was feared lost. In June 3302, an independent
pilot discovered Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system,
suffering from technical issues and effectively stranded.

The galactic community reacted swiftly, launching an independent supply
drive to restore the starport to functionality. The relief effort soon
exceeded its original objective, and many of those involved began to see
the distant system as a chance to establish a new community, far from
the wearisome conflicts and entrenched viewpoints of the core systems.
Talk of a permanent colony went from light-hearted speculation to
serious planning.

In September 3302, [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] was formally renamed 'Colonia',
and the first permanent settlement was constructed on the surface of
Colonia 2A. An influx of migrants boosted the system's population, aided
financially by the Colonia Council, the region's new governing body, and
materially by independent pilots.

Colonia is widely viewed as a monument to community spirit and human
ingenuity, as well as being the first step into a previously uninhabited
region of space. Colonia's population is still small, but the region is
undergoing continuous expansion and attracting attention from both
enterprising corporations and optimistic migrants.

To date, Colonia has remained untroubled by the strife that often
plagues the core systems, earning it a reputation as a sanctuary. But it
remains to be seen if this nascent community will thrive in isolation,
or be engulfed by political and corporate forces.
