* Electoral Reform Proposed for the Alliance

/16 Jun 3307/

Councillor Nakato Kaine has suggested that the Alliance’s current electoral system should be replaced by direct public voting. 

The proposal follows a recent election where Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was reinstated for a second six-year term. 

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, Councillor Kaine said: 

“Only allowing council members to choose the prime minister is a flawed system, vulnerable to corruption and outside influence. The people of the Alliance should have a direct mandate to determine their leader by casting individual votes.” 

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune: 

“Although Kaine stopped short of claiming that Mahon’s victory was achieved fraudulently, the Assembly took a dim view of this attempt at electoral overhaul. Some council members accused her of failing to accept that her policies received considerably less support than those of her rival.” 

“Despite this, a few accepted that there could be merit in such a restructure. However, organising public voting across all Alliance systems would be much harder than in democracies with a more established infrastructure, such as the Federation, or that have smaller populations, such as the Marlinist Colonies.”
