* Far God Cultists Vanishing

/24 Aug 3304/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has revealed that members of the Far God cult are disappearing in large numbers. 

Senior Agent Micah Whitefield told the media: 

“On several occasions, our agents have entered hive-chapels only to discover them completely empty. Intelligence from independent systems describes how entire chapters of the sect have disappeared overnight.” 

“We suspect that adherents are starting to abandon the cult and attempting to return to normal life. We urge everyone to report such individuals to the FIA so we can investigate potential connection to the Thargoids.” 

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented: 

“Although it would be an understandable reaction to the FIA’s relentless persecution, there are no reports of former Far God worshippers returning to their friends and families. These abrupt disappearances remain a mystery.” 

Anti-cult campaigner Juanita Bishop also made a statement: 

“It’s obvious to me that these spies are returning to their Thargoid masters, to inform them of what they’ve learned. Arresting them isn’t enough – we need a more permanent solution for these traitors.”
