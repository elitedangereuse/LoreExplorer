* The Pilots Federation Supports Fuel Rat Initiative

/24 Jun 3301/

[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][The Pilots Federation]] Supports Fuel Rat Initiative  
 
Each year, thousands of pilots go missing in the black. 

Some are waylaid by [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirates]]. Others are lost to the dangers of
space. However, an estimated 63% of all deep space losses are
attributed to pilots who simply run out of fuel in an area where
others rarely tread.

Now a new initiative, which is being backed by the Pilots Federation,
is hoping to turn those figures around. A group of independent pilots,
calling themselves the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]], have begun patrolling the outer
fringes of civilisation. Their mission? To provide assistance to
traders and explorers before their life support runs out.

Commander [[id:07d6db4d-33d2-4026-abbc-2e1ecf22aa2b][Murishani]] of the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] issued the following public service announcement regarding what to do in case of a fuel shortage: 

1)	Do not panic. Panicking costs fuel and air. You are running out of both! 

2)	Remain with your ship. Exit supercruise. Throttle to 0. Disable nonessential modules. 

3)	Call for help from the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] immediately. Time is precious. 

4)	Reduce activity and food consumption. Preserve oxygen. Wait for help. 

A full list of active members of the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] is available from the Pilots Federation upon request.
