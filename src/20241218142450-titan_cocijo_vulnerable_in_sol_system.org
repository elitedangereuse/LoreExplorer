* Titan Cocijo Vulnerable in Sol system

/12 Dec 3310/

The last remaining Thargoid [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]], [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]], is now vulnerable to attack following a concerted effort by [[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][AX]] forces. 

Thargoid forces have been pushed back from systems around [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]], where
[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] currently hangs in orbit above [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]]. The lack of support
from these systems, as with other Titans previously, have left [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]
exposed to a direct assault.

[[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], special military advisor to Aegis, provided the following update via all Federal news feeds: 

“This is our chance to put an end to the Thargoid invasion once and
for all. After two years of struggle, sacrifice and bravery, our
pilots have risked their lives once more to protect humanity from the
greatest threat our people have ever known.”

“We have many pilots still out there – many of which have fought from
the very first Titan’s arrival. If you’re able, they could use your
support. Ships equipped with [[id:26caa006-c4e8-4430-b8af-57d3df0ce9c7][Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser]], [[id:345f3ec9-42be-46e1-a75c-a53dd92f3e13][Caustic Sink
Launchers]], and a [[id:d4b88dc3-0b7e-4871-8cd4-47e0cac7e4c6][Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon]] will be capable of
navigating the [[id:94acc379-e939-46dc-835d-ac68d6d4c4c7][Maelstrom]] around [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] to strike the Titan’s [[id:779c9e94-fbd8-4387-94fc-0ed554e80f59][Heat
Vents]], ultimately forcing a meltdown state.”

Pilots looking to join the fight against [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] should outfit
their ships accordingly and join the [[id:287f5f56-820c-4802-8af0-fee7573203ca][Battle for Sol]]. [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] scanners
will record any damage inflicted on [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] by individual ships, so
pilots will not need to register at a port prior to participation.
