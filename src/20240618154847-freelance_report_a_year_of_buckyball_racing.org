* Freelance Report: A Year of Buckyball Racing

/22 Jul 3302/

The Buckyball Racing Club was formed, one year ago, to provide a schedule of races involving a wide variety of pilots. In its first year the club hosted a total of 28 races, and to celebrate it is hosting one of its craziest yet: the BuckyBubble! 

Commemorating the club's most famous race, the A* Challenge, the BuckyBubble starts at Lomas Station in the Wolf 359 system. Racers will navigate a route that passes through 60 systems loosely resembling the shape of a buckyball molecule. 

Pilots are invited to join the chaos from the 23rd of July to the 7th of August.
