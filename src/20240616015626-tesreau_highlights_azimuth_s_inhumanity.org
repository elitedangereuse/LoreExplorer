* Tesreau Highlights Azimuth’s ‘Inhumanity’

/27 Jul 3308/

A counter-statement regarding Azimuth Biotech has been published by
Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], former head of research at [[id:a6b33331-c1bb-44cf-9717-f72eb0f63c99][Aegis]].

“The recent declaration by Director [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] paints a false
picture of those pilots who are actively working against [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth
Biotech]]. He frames them as criminals and alien sympathisers, betraying
humanity to the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]]. This could not be any further from the
truth. It is Azimuth’s own inhumanity that they are fighting against.”

“It’s unsurprising that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s focus is now on [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]], given
this system has long been part of Azimuth’s sinister legacy. On planet
7c is the abandoned settlement [[id:117f59dd-4f18-47a4-88a1-ac5b3088b78a][Fort Asch]], where unlicensed scientists
performed monstrous experiments to link human minds with Thargoid
vessels. We know from [[id:4668be49-dfb5-4946-ac42-e74530553fd9][Project Seraph]]’s sole survivor, known as [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Subject
D-2]], how brutal the results were.”

“Alongside the [[id:f55dd9f1-52aa-4ca9-93c4-27175612c59a][Bright Sentinel]] above planet 10b is the [[id:f989f055-f0ea-4c64-8852-d7d5eacf99ec][Overlook]], a
derelict megaship drifting within a caustic cloud of debris. Some may
have assumed it is the scene of a recent Thargoid attack, but in fact
it once served as the headquarters of [[id:42b6a882-f396-4017-87de-9080d6291940][Black Flight]]. This secretive
organisation arranged strike teams to suppress evidence of the
Thargoids from the general public. Azimuth’s collaboration with Black
Flight helped it establish a monopoly on xenological research.”

“For the past two centuries, Azimuth has ruthlessly sought to obtain
and weaponise alien technology. The crew of the Alexandria were
sacrificed in order to steal Guardian material for its
superweapon. Now that same genocidal device, paid for with the blood
of thousands, is being hailed as a ‘noble enterprise’.”

“Caleb Wycherley has reinvented himself as Salvation, but his modern
persona cannot conceal his malignant nature. Those who Rademaker
accused of betrayal are in fact driven by conscience and a sense of
justice. I call upon the leaders of the Alliance, Empire and
Federation to follow their example, and withdraw support for this
nefarious organisation.”
