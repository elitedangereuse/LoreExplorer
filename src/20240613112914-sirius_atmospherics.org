The early terraforming tended to use genetically engineered biological
processes that would change the atmosphere of a suitable world over
many decades to a breathable atmosphere using energy captured from the
star via biological processes. This process was both slow, expensive
(it was made up of many stages) and only a narrow set of worlds were
suitable. The idea of doing direct chemical conversion on a vast scale
was there, but not practical because of the vast power requirements.
