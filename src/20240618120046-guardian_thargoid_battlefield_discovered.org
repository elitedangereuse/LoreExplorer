* Guardian-Thargoid Battlefield Discovered

/18 Jun 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

An Anaconda from the Hesperus megaship has been found at a historical battlefield on the moon Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a. 

The discovery was made by pilots who tracked down a series of signal beacons, following instructions provided by the anonymous ‘Salvation’. The beacons were deployed by the Hesperus during its voyage nearly 200 years ago. 

The Anaconda, named Proteus, was one of the megaship’s secondary vessels and had been outfitted for long-range exploration. It was used by an [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]] science team to flee the Hesperus after the megaship was overtaken by saboteurs from rival company Pharmasapien. 

Upon landing, the Proteus was converted into a research facility to study the ancient structures and wreckage on the moon. The proximity of both Guardian and Thargoid technology suggests this was the site of a battle fought by the two civilisations over a million years ago, although in 3113 neither species had yet been identified. 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] of Aegis Research gave this statement: 

“This is a significant xenoarchaeological find – physical evidence of the war between the Guardians and the Thargoids. Our advance teams are conducting preliminary surveys, and a megaship is being prepared. Following the Alexandria’s tragic disappearance, we hope this may serve as a fresh source of Guardian artefacts for our anti-xeno research programme.”
