On September 20th 3302 former Federal president Jasmina Halsey broke her silence to share news of “a compelling vision” with the galactic community. / In a public address at the Gotham Park in the Alioth system, Halsey described the nature of her vision: / “I saw a place of extraordinary beauty. A paradise. It was truly wonderful.” / “This was no dream - it was a glimpse of something very real.” / “We must find this place. It could be our future.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
