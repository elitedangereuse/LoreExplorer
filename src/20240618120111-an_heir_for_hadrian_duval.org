* An Heir for Hadrian Duval

/21 Sep 3307/

Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Augustus Duval, has confirmed that she is expecting a child in December. 

The story was broken by the Paresa News Network: 

“Lady Astrid was visibly overjoyed as she told us of her pregnancy, and of Hadrian’s excitement at being a father. Her only complaint was that she’s no longer allowed to fly support missions for Nova Imperium. Once a Commander, always a Commander!” 

Mainstream media channels also commented on the news. 

The Imperial Herald: “This has caused tangible ripples of unease in the Senate. Since neither Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] nor Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] have heirs, Hadrian’s claim to the throne will be strengthened if he alone ensures that the Duval bloodline continues.” 

Eye on [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]]: “Who cares about the spawn of Emperor Hengist’s illegitimate grandson? The [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] may have assassinated much of the Imperial Family, but this outcast boy is still a footnote in their noble history.” 

Vox Galactica: “Despite his unofficial status, Hadrian Duval has many silent supporters within the Empire. His isolationist stance appeals to nostalgic citizens, as does returning to the tradition of male Emperors. Should Hadrian have a son, he may feel empowered to seek his birthright more forcefully.”
