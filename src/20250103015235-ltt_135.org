'Getting you there with the power of air.'

The home of Hyperion Intelligence Agency. Chastised for their
imperialistic views while serving their original faction in Federation
space, these renegade members broke from their conservative masters. A
conflict ensued where the separatist forces expedited the destruction

progressive commanders reformed as the Hyperion Intelligence Agency
and then sought out a home in Imperial space to begin building their
ruthless and effective faction, specialising in subterfuge and system
control.
