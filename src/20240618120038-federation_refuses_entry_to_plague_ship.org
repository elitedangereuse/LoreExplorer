* Federation Refuses Entry to ‘Plague Ship’

/24 May 3307/

The Alexandria megaship has been warned that it faces destruction if it attempts to travel to any Federal system. 

The Aegis-owned vessel triggered a full-scale Thargoid incursion when it arrived in the HIP 16538 system. This seemed to be a reaction to the huge quantities of Guardian artefacts currently stored within its cargo holds.  

Captain Jacob Morales, the Alexandria’s commander, broadcast this message: 

“The Federal Navy has instructed us not to resume our scheduled journey to [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] or enter any system within the Federation. They’re treating us like a plague ship! I understand their concern that more Thargoids will follow us, but we have several thousand crewmembers who need to reach safe harbour.” 

A strategy was outlined by Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], chief military liaison for Aegis: 

“We are attempting to clear the HIP 16538 system of Thargoid vessels, greatly aided by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. The megaship will then jump to a system with a minimal population, where we will offload its cargo.” 

Aegis has reiterated that the option to jettison the Alexandria’s cargo is a last resort, since the Guardian artefacts are vital to its research programme and cost billions of credits to acquire.
