* Coalition of Othime Campaign

/09 Mar 3304/

The Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid base. 

A spokesperson for the Coalition said: 

“Othime relies heavily on its refineries, but those refineries are limited to small and medium cargo vessels, which limits the amount of revenue we can generate. A new asteroid base would allow us to support large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to compete with other refineries in the sector.” 

The organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded. 

The campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
