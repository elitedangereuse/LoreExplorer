* Ulyanov Discusses [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] Outposts

/28 Nov 3304/

Exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov has commented on the abandoned [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] outposts recently discovered in the Etain system: 

“This fascinating discovery implies that the missing chapters of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] sect were not arrested or killed, but instead fled to secret outposts to avoid persecution.”  

“According to personal logs recovered from the sites, the sect’s members planned to wait in suspended animation for the coming of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]]. The logs also reveal surprising details about what motivated these individuals to devote themselves to the faith.”  

“Evidence suggests that the settlements on Etain 4a and 4c both came under attack, but whether by Thargoids or human forces is unclear. Mysteriously, no trace remains of the inhabitants.” 

“I am indebted to the explorers who discovered these sites. This information will significantly contribute to the book I am co-writing with Gethin Okonkwo about the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] religion.”
