* Alliance Festival of Culture Celebrates Finale

/06 Sep 3305/

The Alliance Festival of Culture has entered its final week with a celebration of food and drink on the planet Birmingham in the Diso system.  

Corinne Macintyre, culture correspondent for the Alliance Tribune, reported: 

“City streets are lined with stalls offering a wide range of food. Dishes range from humble, home-cooked recipes using local speciality Diso Ma Corn, to delicacies such as baked greebles. Drink connoisseurs have sampled everything from Ethgreze Tea Buds to Leestian Evil Juice, while a multi-storey cocktail bar sponsored by distillers of Lavian Brandy has attracted revellers.” 

“Despite some companies experiencing difficulty sourcing ingredients, following lower than expected harvests in some systems, this event has been enjoyed by millions of hungry visitors.” 

To mark the conclusion of the seven-week festival, Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] made this announcement: 

“I’d like to offer my sincerest thanks to everyone who helped make the Alliance Festival of Culture a grand success. We’ve enjoyed amazing artwork, heard beautiful music and experienced great theatre in recent weeks, much to our delight. I have been reminded just how diverse and colourful the Alliance’s shared cultures can be. Artists and creatives across the galaxy are invited to make the Alliance their home and further enrich this vibrant society.”
