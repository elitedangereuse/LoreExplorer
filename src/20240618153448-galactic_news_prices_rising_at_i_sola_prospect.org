* Galactic News: Prices Rising at i Sola Prospect

/17 Feb 3302/

Last month, the Imperial Inquisition launched a campaign to develop the outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1. The campaign was a resounding success, making i Sola Prospect the first planetary outpost to boast a complete range of services, including a comprehensive shipyard. But authorities in Brestla have now announced that they intend to increase the cost of services at the state-of-the-art facility â€“ a decision that is sure to disappoint some sections of the galactic community. 

"It costs a lot for manufacturers to ship such large payloads from their core systems", said a spokesperson, "and unfortunately some of these costs must be passed on to the consumer. We are therefore increasing the prices of all outfitting and shipyard services at i Sola Prospect by 20 per cent. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." 

The price increase will be implemented immediately.
