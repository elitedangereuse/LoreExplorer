* Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force Appeal

/13 Jun 3305/

Evangeline’s Elite Expeditionary Force has revealed plans to build a megaship in the Shana Bei system. 

Archangel Evangeline, commander of the faction, made the following announcement: 

“The successful construction of the megaship EFS Archangel will serve not only the Federation, but the entire galactic community. EFS Archangel will provide a hub for our military operations, allowing us to bring the fight to our enemies and defend imperilled systems. Together, we will make EFS Archangel a safe place to trade and share knowledge. Long live humanity!" 

To ensure completion of the project, the organisation has requested superconductors, computer components and insulating membranes from the galactic community. Pilots who contribute these resources to the Force at Chu City in Shana Bei will be rewarded at the conclusion of the project.  

The campaign will take place between the 13th and 19th of June 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
