* Winters Resists Hudson’s Legacy Projects

/13 Nov 3309/

President-elect [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] has vowed to defeat new legislation proposed by outgoing President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]]. 

If funded, these initiatives will establish a media standards regulator, set up a political think tank, and merge the Proactive Detection Bureau into the Federal Navy Intelligence Office. Tax rebates will also be granted to all corporations with existing government contracts. 

The Federal Times approached [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] for comment: 

“It’s obvious that these pro-Republican measures are being pushed through because of [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]]'s poor electoral performance. It would look bad for Hudson to admit that his own vice president wasn’t a popular choice of successor. So now he's giving Archer as many advantages as possible for when he becomes shadow president.” 

“We aim to block these legislative changes should they go through Congress. And I personally guarantee that once I am in office, the PDB will no longer eavesdrop on every citizen’s private communications. That’s more than just an election pledge – it’s about doing what is right.” 

The newsfeed also published a statement by [[id:167df18a-99f8-4279-bc55-a736f6af44c2][Owen McKenna]], CEO of [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]]: 

“Winters says that she plans to cut back on military spending. That makes no sense during wartime, but as president it’ll be her call. So, if you ask me, Hudson’s corporate tax rebates should be allowed to stand. Then at least companies who supply the Federal Navy might have a chance of remaining profitable.”
