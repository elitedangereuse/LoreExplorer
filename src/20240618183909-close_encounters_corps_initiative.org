* Close Encounters Corps Initiative

/11 Oct 3304/

The Close Encounters Corps has announced its intention to construct a scientific megaship in the BD-12 1172 system. The new vessel will allow research teams to map and explore the planets of the surrounding nebula. 

Admiral Anton Vern of the Close Encounters Corps issued the following statement: 

"A number of survey groups have expressed interest in mapping the nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. This new scientific vessel will act as a base from which they can research the abundance of unexplored planets throughout the nebula." 

To facilitate construction of the megaship, the Close Encounters Corps has placed an open order for muon imagers, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Crown Prospect in the Kagutsuchi system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 11th of October 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
