Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] has revealed that she recently visited Imperator[[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]], leader of the isolationist group Nova Imperium. 

The Imperial Herald published her statement: 

“For some time, I have regretted my initial dismissal of Hadrian. Had I known that Arissa intended to carry out such a brutal purge of his followers, my approach would have been different.” 

“Although he has been labelled an enemy of the Empire, I found myself unable to ignore this new member of the Duval family, and so requested a meeting in the Paresa system.” 

“Another reason to make contact was to verify his claim to be Emperor Hengist's grandson. All the genetic tests were conclusive – Hadrian is indeed my cousin by blood.” 

“We have now opened a dialogue to see if there can ever be common ground between us. Perhaps together we can heal divisions within the Empire.”
