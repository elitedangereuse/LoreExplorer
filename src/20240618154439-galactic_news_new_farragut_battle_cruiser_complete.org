* Galactic News: New Farragut Battle Cruiser Complete

/17 Mar 3302/

The Beta Hydri Corporation has announced that the Federal campaign to construct a new Farragut Battle Cruiser is now complete. According to a company spokesperson, the galactic community responded positively to the appeal, resulting in the rapid construction of the new Federal vessel. Captain G.C. Richards, who oversaw the project, released a brief statement to the media: 

"The Federation extends its gratitude to all those who supported this initiative. Your hard work has given the Federal Navy a potent new asset." 

Captain Richards went on to single out a pilot by the name of Commander Khemsa, who made the largest single contribution to the initiative. President Hudson has even extended the honour of naming the new ship to Commander Khemsa in recognition of their singular contribution. 

The new ship is expected to embark on its inaugural voyage soon.
