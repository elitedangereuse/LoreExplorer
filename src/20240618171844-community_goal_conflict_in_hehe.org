* Community Goal: Conflict in Hehe

/04 Aug 3303/

Authorities in the Hehe system have reported that conflict has erupted between Hehe Federal Interstellar and Hehe Camorra. System security forces have confirmed that the fighting began several hours ago and has escalated rapidly since then. 

The conflict is understood to be territorial in nature, with both factions eager to take control of Hehe. Both sides have issued calls for support, and have pledged to reward combat pilots who rally to their respective causes. 

A representative of system security forces commented on the development: 

“Inter-faction conflict of this sort tends to be quite focused, and we believe that the probability of civilian casualties is low. Nevertheless, we’re advising anyone living or travelling in the system to exercise caution.” 

The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 3rd of August 3303.
