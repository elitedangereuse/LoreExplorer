* 0710 Community Bar
[[id:34bddae0-0d06-4648-ad0b-cf7143f239ee][HIP 110028]]

Thanks to a community effort in October 3303 a space bar installation
was completed on the orbit of this [[id:7fec1142-ab20-47e1-b746-36edee889cc3][Earth-like]] world, at the time a
fairly unexplored planet. The bar is called "[[id:39fe691a-ac2e-4954-8f3b-9247dbd70fc9][11 Parsecs]]" and attracts
many tourists from the Core Worlds, as it offers a wide selection of
rare alcoholic beverages, otherwise available only in their respective
systems of origin. The tourist clientele is rich and
sophisticated. Sometimes a few rugged spacers can be seen amongst
them - these are the Commanders that helped build the bar. They often
return to this place to have a drink or two and chat about the good
old times, before the Thargoids came
