* Freelance Report: Distant Worlds Expedition Reaches [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]]

/29 Mar 3302/

Nearly three months ago, approximately 1,000 pilots set a course for
[[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0]], informally designated '[[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]],' on the far
side of the Milky Way.

This week, Distant Worlds Expedition coordinators announced that some members of the fleet have reached their destination. A charismatic member of the expedition – a Commander by the name of [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salomé]] – was among the first to arrive at [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]]. 

A total of 23 pre-arranged waypoints have helped to organise the fleet and facilitate social interaction, including SRV races. Unfortunately, this coordination has not completely mitigated losses: of the 1,000 commanders who set out for [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]], it is estimated that only 25% have survived the 81,500 light-year journey, and it's likely that the return journey will result in further losses.
