* Thargoid Cultists Prepare for Religious Voyages

/06 Aug 3307/

Three megaships are being populated by the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult, part of their latest effort to recruit members and find their alien deity. 

The first vessel, the Testament, will serve as a missionary ship and journey throughout the core systems, attempting to convert new followers to the Thargoid-worshipping sect. 

While the mystical cult is typically secretive in nature, Vox Galactica obtained a quote from a member named the Second Witness of the Seventieth Chapter: 

“The masses are deaf to the voice of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]]. What you see as alien monsters, we view as messengers from a very real multi-dimensional being. The Testament will help us carry the word of Its imminent arrival.” 

Two other megaships have been outfitted for long-range journeys. The Perdition and the Sacrosanct will carry many thousands of cultists on what they view as a pilgrimage to the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]]. 

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian and expert on the religion, commented: 

“This fringe creed, which has survived endless abuse and attacks, has now reached a surprising level of organisation. Most of us associate the Thargoids with death and destruction, making it all the more remarkable that these people see only divinity.”
