* 0684 Unknown Probe Code
[[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]]

On August 20th 3302 The [[id:2c8da7ca-a8b5-4ea1-bd52-e38ae83a9654][Canonn Interstellar Research]] group discovered,
recorded and translated a tight-beam transmission from an [[id:446a1bfd-b449-48b4-9e14-e4cb1fcef664][Unknown
Probe]] directed at [[id:8c469ca9-3f5e-4728-a488-1039623174fb][Merope 5c]].

[[id:112b5795-655f-4cc1-9995-b7aa39cb27c4][Research]] into the Probes has so far been hindered by their scarcity,
but with the number of Probes found increasing, transmission analysis
efforts ramped up, leading to successful decryption. The transmission
was found to contain blocks of [[id:4a2a29f4-8edd-4cf2-b347-a023dac7ab26][octal]] numbers describing planetary data
such as radius, surface temperature, gravity and atmospheric
composition.
