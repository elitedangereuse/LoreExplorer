* The Fall of Aegis

/07 Feb 3308/

Shutdown procedures for the anti-xeno organisation are continuing, despite Aegis’s warnings that Azimuth has returned.  

Conrad Sterling reported on the situation for Vox Galactica: 

“We now know that the Alexandria megaship was targeted by a hostile force that could be [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]], the 200-year-old corporation which owned the Adamastor and Hesperus. In the face of this new evidence, Aegis leaders have petitioned for it to be reinstated.” 

“Even while accounting for this new evidence, the Baumann Report has exposed a litany of organisational failures within Aegis. There is still a broad consensus among politicians that the organisation should have done more to repel the Thargoids.” 

“Many senior military figures have switched focus to Aegis’s controversial rival [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]], despite his mysterious nature. As one Imperial Navy admiral succinctly put it: ‘Salvation’s methods have proved more effective in counteracting the Thargoid threat.’” 

“The issue of military staff defections also appears to have been resolved. Alliance, Federal and Imperial fleets have opened channels of secondment, allowing naval crews to voluntarily take positions aboard [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s vessels without resigning their commissions.” 

“However, one of Aegis’s requests has been authorised. There will be a public ceremony to posthumously award medals of honour to Captain Jacob Morales and the four thousand people who lost their lives aboard the Alexandria.”
