Of all the mega-corporations to dominate civilised space, none compare
to the wealth and influence of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]].

The rise of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] began in 2339, when the organisation
launched a corporate colonisation mission -- the first of its kind -- to
the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] system. From there, the corporation went on to become the
lead supplier of fuel and technologies to both the Empire and the
Federation, catapulting it to powerhouse status. The corporation's
promise not to favour either side in the event of conflict helped to
cement its position.

As the corporation grew, fuel supply and drive manufacture remained its
core business, although judicious expansion into other markets supported
its expansion.

But the corporation's ascendance has not been without complication. In
3251 it introduced a technologically revolutionary passenger liner
called the Antares, which it hoped would usher in a new age in
interplanetary travel. Unfortunately, however, the ship disappeared
during its maiden voyage. It was speculated that a failure in the ship's
internal containment systems had destroyed the vessel, but it was not
until 3302 that wreckage from the ship was recovered and this hypothesis
proved correct.

The 'Antares Incident' cast a long shadow, stalling the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]]
Corporation's plans to develop further superfast liners. But 3278 saw a
reversal of fortune with the introduction of a new, faster drive system.
The success of this new system more than made up for the losses that
followed the Antares Incident, propelling the organisation to new
heights.

Today, the corporation has multiple divisions, many of them giant
conglomerates themselves, but its primary focus remains the manufacture
of fusion reactors, hyperdrives and hyperdrive fuels. This division
still operates under the banner of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], although
technically it is conducted by [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Hyperdrives, with the parent
corporation acting as a holding company.

The company's mining, industrial and power divisions are probably its
largest. [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Mining works closely with Sirius Industrial to produce
specialist equipment for both planetary and asteroid mining, in addition
to industrial smelters and refineries, atmospheric-processing units and
waste-processing reactors. [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Power produces generators ranging from
10-kilowatt devices to 100-gigawatt plants for industrial facilities and
atmospheric processors.

The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] maintains a large private fleet with which to
defend its interests. The majority of its ships are supplied by
Gutamaya, although a proportion are manufactured under licence in
Sirius's own shipyards.

The corporation controls dozens of star systems, and has even created a
governmental subdivision, [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Gov, dedicated to managing these
systems. Indeed, it has been observed that the people of these systems
enjoy better quality of life and greater personal security -- courtesy
of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]]'s private fleet -- than many independent systems.
