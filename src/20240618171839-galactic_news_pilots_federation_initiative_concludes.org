* Galactic News: Pilots Federation Initiative Concludes

/07 Jul 3303/

The Pilots Federation has announced that its campaign to clear the LHS 3447, Eravate and [[id:b21e7cf9-145c-4546-8305-8dc866024f3c][Asellus Primus]] systems of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of combat pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the systems. 

The purpose of the initiative was to secure the systems for inexperienced pilots, many of whom start their careers there. As the campaign drew to a close, authorities in the pertinent systems reiterated their hope that the success of the initiative would allow peacekeeping forces to maintain lasting peace. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cleve Hub in the Erevate system, Beagle 2 Landing in the [[id:b21e7cf9-145c-4546-8305-8dc866024f3c][Asellus Primus]] system or Dalton [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]] in the LHS 3447 system.
