* The Kingfisher Xeno-Peace Mission

/17 Nov 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Kingfisher megaship has requested supplies for its planned journey to greet the first rogue signal source. 

Shipments of basic medicines, fruit and vegetables are required for the Kingfisher’s crew, who will be joined by over 3,000 supporters of the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Semiconductors and Muon Imagers have also been requested to establish the mission’s communications arrays, which are being designed to initiate contact with the Thargoids. 

Congressman Dalton Chase gave a press statement regarding the initiative: 

“Now that we know the approaching anomalies are Thargoid, many are concerned that hostilities between our species will escalate. However, a brave group of volunteers see this as an opportunity to prove that diplomacy can work. An alien race has sent emissaries toward humanity’s space, and it is our duty to meet them with words rather than weapons.” 

“The first of the anomalies, which we have named Taranis, is predicted to pass through Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1. Using the high-level protocols available to Congress, I have successfully obtained a temporary access restriction that grants an exclusive permit to the Kingfisher. A range of broadcasts using multiple techniques will try to attract the Thargoids’ attention. Hopefully, the entity will slow down long enough to give some acknowledgement of these attempts.” 

The delivery initiative in the Andavandul system is being managed by Deutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar. In order to protect deliveries to Blenkinsop Hub, the faction is offering increased payouts on bounty voucher redemptions.
