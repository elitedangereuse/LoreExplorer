* 0119 Caker Coup
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]  

In 2853, the science research outpost of [[id:fdf67e2f-4b6c-40ff-b1f8-9ccc8638b82f][Nesbitt Landing]] was
founded. Initially this was to be a joint venture between the Empire
and [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]], but when a detailed study into the genetic problems on
[[id:47df3d18-6cdd-443d-baae-0e3af142a089][New California]] linked the issue with the terraforming of the planet in
2612, the Imperials withdrew from the project.

The matter remained a local issue until, in 2854, responding to
pressure from [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]], Imperial soldiers instigated martial law and
attempted to impose a genetic correction programme on the planet. This
was precented by a [[id:0ce3c70c-e3ae-4a4b-8291-2db41b5058ac][coup]] against the military garrison by a new [[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Caker]]
sect. Within days, the planet had been secured and an appreal was sent
to [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] for assistance.

A fierce battle ensued; Imperial forces from the orbital refineries
began a planetary bombardment, but the arrival of a Federal fleet
escalated the conflict. Eventually, the Imperial ships pulled back and
[[id:6b6da1a6-087f-48c2-99b6-055141a3b6a1][Admiral Kracer]] landed with his marines to cheering crowds in the
capital. Kracer retired three years later, settling in New California
and later became the colony leader.
