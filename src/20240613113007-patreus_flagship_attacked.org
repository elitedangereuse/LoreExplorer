* 0670 Patreus' Flagship Attacked
[[id:9fa174ce-7273-40ba-a0e6-1225bcda40b6][Eotienses]]

On November 4th 3302 eyewitness reports from the Eotienses system
indicate that an attack has taken place on Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]]'
flaship, the INV Imperial Freedom. The Majestic-class Interdictor was
heavily damaged in the altercation and was ignominiously forced to
withdraw from the field of combat.

an organisation known as the [[id:7b48eea2-ee5f-47f9-9e14-8f5e827766b4][Children of Raxxla]] claimed responsibility
for the attack. In a statement, the organisation said it had been
"backed into a corner" after diplomatic entreaties regarding Kahina
Loren - whom it referred to as [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salom√©]] - had gone unanswered.
