* Galactic News: Appeal for Ancient Data Concludes

/10 Nov 3302/

A spokesperson for United Meene Labour has announced that its appeal for data from the Synuefe ruins has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Felice Dock, the organisation's base of operations. 

Engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]], who is leading research into the ruins, has extended his gratitude to the many independent explorers who responded to the appeal. 

In a statement, [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] said: 

"I can't wait to start analysing the data. With luck, this will be the first step towards unlocking the ruins' secrets." 

Ram Tah went on to say he would do everything in his power to ensure the site was protected from "irresponsible agencies seeking to capitalise on the site for personal, political or military gain. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.
