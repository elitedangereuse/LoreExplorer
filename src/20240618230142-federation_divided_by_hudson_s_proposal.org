* Federation Divided by Hudson’s Proposal

/15 Feb 3308/

President Zachary Hudson’s intention to remove the limit on his term in office has caused a deep rift among congressmen and voters alike. 

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino analysed the situation in The Federal Times: 

“Ever since the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord was ratified in 2594, no president has remained in office for longer than eight years. This is why the Hudson Contravention, as Congress officially refers to it, has turned up the heat on the simmering political division within the Federation.” 

“Members of the Cabinet and other leading Republicans have argued passionately that only [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] has the experience and fortitude to guide the Federation through this eventful period in history. His supporters point to successes such as curtailing the secession crisis, ending the NMLA threat and introducing greater security via the Proactive Detection Bureau.” 

“However, others insist that repealing this amendment could pave the way from democracy to dictatorship. Two former presidents – [[id:e70b7d46-d965-4fb7-859b-e67cacd230e5][Antonia Madison]] and Jasmina Halsey – have publicly condemned the Hudson Contravention as unconstitutional and dangerous.” 

“There are expectations that Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] will move for a vote of no confidence. Political analysts suspect that after several controversial leadership decisions from Hudson last year, he would be unlikely to win over a majority in Congress.”
