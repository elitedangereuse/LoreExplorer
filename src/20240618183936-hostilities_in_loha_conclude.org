* Hostilities in Loha Conclude

/29 Nov 3304/

The conflict between two rival factions in the Loha system has now come to an end. 

Karleen Troy, freelance warzone reporter, delivered a report for the Vox Galactica news service: 

“This has been a harrowing week for the people of Loha. In that time, I’ve witnessed acts of brutality and heroism from both sides. But now that their resources are exhausted, overall control of the system has finally been established.” 

“For those pilots who took advantage of the conflict, this will have been a profitable exercise. Both factions have announced that pilots can now collect their rewards from Whitworth Station in the Loha system.”
