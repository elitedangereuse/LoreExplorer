* New Phase for Alliance-Sirius Partnership

/22 Dec 3307/

The Alliance Assembly has invited Sirius Corporation to collaborate on enhancing protection for member systems against the Thargoids. 

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported on the development for The Alliance Tribune: 

“Sirius Corporation has been a key partner in the Alliance’s expansion programme. Most notably, its subsidiary Sirius Atmospherics helped establish colonies in the Coalsack Nebula to support meta-alloy harvesting.” 

“But according to insiders, the suspension of Aegis and the increasing Thargoid presence has raised fears that Alliance systems may be vulnerable to xeno invasion. This has led to Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] suggesting a strategic defence contract with the megacorp.” 

“In response, CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] himself has travelled to the Alioth system. It’s understood that high-level discussions are taking place on ways in which the company might augment the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]]’s capabilities.” 

“Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon’s political rival, has repeated her claim that Sirius Corporation has a disturbing amount of influence over some council members. She fears that private agreements are being made behind closed doors, and has called for increased transparency.”
