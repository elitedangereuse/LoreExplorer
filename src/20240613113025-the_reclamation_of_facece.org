On July 2nd 3302, and after months of vicious fighting, the Imperial Naval Auxiliary reinstated the Facece Empire Party as the controlling power of the Facece system. / Marquis Endincite, who coordinated the effort to reclaim the system, made the following statement to the Imperial Herald: / "The Empire Party has regained the administration of Facece, and we beseech Imperial commanders everywhere to ensure its continued dominance in the system. Never again should the Empire allow its pre-eminent naval base to fall under the sway of disloyal elements."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
