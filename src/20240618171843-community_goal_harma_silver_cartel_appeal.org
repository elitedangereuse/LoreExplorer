* Community Goal: Harma Silver Cartel Appeal

/28 Jul 3303/

The Harma Silver Cartel has announced that it intends to bring back a beverage that has been lost for several hundred years: rum. 

Reports indicate that the organisation recently discovered a time capsule from the 24th century containing a recipe for the drink, as well as the log of one Captain Smolenski. Although the Cartel is keeping the recipe secret, it has placed an open order for a range of rare alcohols that will be used to create the new beverage. 

The Cartel has promised to reward those who deliver the requested commodities to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. The organisation has also promised to bring the drink to the market under the name Harma Silver Sea Rum, assuming the campaign is successful. 

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement: 

“We will create the finest rum since the days of piracy on the seas of Earth. After all, a pirate isn’t a pirate without rum!” 

But the announcement has antagonised other pirate organisations in the Harma system, many of which have threatened to blockade the Cartel’s base of operations and attack pilots delivering alcohols to Gabriel Enterprise. 

To counter this threat, the Harma Silver Cartel has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Gabriel Enterprise. 

The two-pronged initiative begins on 27th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
