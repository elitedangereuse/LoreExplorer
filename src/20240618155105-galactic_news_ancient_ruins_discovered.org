* Galactic News: Ancient Ruins Discovered

/31 Oct 3302/

Four days ago, the galaxy was stunned by news that mysterious ruins had been discovered in the [[id:bfba5e37-ad9f-4fbb-a19c-5156313c79a4][Synuefe XR-H d11-102]] system. 

The discovery was made by an independent pilot known by the callsign 'xdeath'. Once the find was made public, pilots from across the galaxy flocked to investigate the site. 

Although a formal survey of the ruins has not yet been conducted, speculation is rife that they are of non-human origin. Images of the site, which show mysterious structures and a series of complex earthworks, appear to support this hypothesis. 

The discovery of the ruins is only one of a number of remarkable finds made over the past few years. The Unknown Artefacts, Unknown Probes, the so-called organic structures and the crash site in the [[id:c32901ed-73d1-4ca6-aeb8-5bcd795d1036][Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4]] system have piqued the curiosity of the entire galactic community. But the relationship between these discoveries – if any – has yet to be determined.
