* The Fastest Pilot in the Galaxy

/19 Feb 3301/

This is Casey Murrow and today I'm talking exclusively with Commander Samwell Drakhyr, winner of this yearâ€™s big race, the St. Valentine Day Regatta. So just how did you manage to win it all Sam? 

"A bad pilot is controlled by their ship. They are surprised all the time, because their mind is in harmony with neither ship nor surroundings. A good pilot controls their ship. They are surprised only half the time, because they know the limits of their ship so well that it is becomes part of them, directed by the pilot's will without conscious effort, like a limb." 

"I strive to go beyond that. I scout my route until I own it. I make it part of me. I do my thinking in advance so when I fly on the day there is no mind, no ship, no pilot that exists as separate entities. My hands move, yet in a way it feels like they are steady, inevitable, and it is instead the universe itself that is moving." 

Excellent and inspiring advice there from Commander Drakhyr, champion of the 37th almost annual St. Valentine Day Regatta.
