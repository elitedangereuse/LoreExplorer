* Far God Campaign Concludes

/07 Sep 3304/

LHS 2541 Alliance Combine has announced that its request for Thargoid materials for the Far God sect has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community.  

Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system, and by eliminating agitators in Zavijah, thereby ensuring the safety of traders contributing to the initiative. 

Chancellor Reegan Tanner, speaking on behalf of LHS 2541 Alliance Combine, released the following statement:  

“We would like to thank those pilots who delivered Thargoid materials, thus contributing to the furtherance of religious freedom throughout the galaxy. At this point we would also like to address rumours that the Far God sect is experimenting on willing test subjects in the hopes of ascending to a higher form of life. We assert, in the strongest of terms, that this is baseless gossip.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system.
