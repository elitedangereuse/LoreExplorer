On September 2nd 3302 the Canonn Interstellar Research Group released further information about the Unknown Probe. / Shortly after planetary data was found in the probe's tight-beam transmission, a message was sent to the Canonn from a pilot by the name of Commander Wace. It read: “The headerless octal number - it is distance compared to Merope!” / In an impressive display of field mathematics, Commander Wace pin-pointed the COL 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 system as the Probe's zero point. Unfortunately, the Canonn is prevented from further investigation of the system by the permit lock of the COL 70 Sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
