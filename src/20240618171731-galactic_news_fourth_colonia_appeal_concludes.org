* Galactic News: Fourth Colonia Appeal Concludes

/06 Apr 3303/

The fourth Colonia Council migration appeal has come to an end. Hundreds of organisations took part in the campaign, delivering huge quantities of material to Jaques Station in the hope of earning a place in the Colonia Nebula. 

As the appeal drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Colonia Council released a statement: 

"This has been yet another great success for the Colonia community, and we would once again like to express our gratitude to all those who contributed. Once we have confirmed how much material has been delivered, we will contact the organisations that made the largest contribution, and start work on their new outposts."
