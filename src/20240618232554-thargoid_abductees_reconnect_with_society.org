* [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Abductees Reconnect with Society

/03 Nov 3309/

People who have been rescued from [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Titans remain in quarantine, but can soon expect family visits and access to comms networks. 

Aegis reported that bio-storage capsules are still being successfully extracted from the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] motherships, albeit at high risk to pilots. Each revived individual has been placed in medical isolation, as per guidance from Aegis specialists. 

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, who coordinates the Alliance’s involvement with Aegis, discussed the situation in a session of the Assembly: 

“All abductees are being monitored for signs of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] physical or mental influence. So far, I’m pleased to say, these test results remain negative. Therefore, those from Allied systems are now permitted to receive visitors, while remaining under strict quarantine conditions. They are also being granted direct access to comms and public media. I understand that Federal, Imperial and most independent authorities will shortly follow suit with their own citizens.” 

Director Nassim Qadir, head of medical research at Azimuth Biotech, was quoted in a formal statement from the corporation: 

“Isolating all the returnees was prudent, but they should not be treated like normal people. The [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] went to great lengths to capture living humans, and we have not yet determined the reason. It’s possible they are acting as carriers of an alien pathogen, or affected in some other way that Aegis’s inferior procedures cannot detect.” 

“We propose that Azimuth Biotech takes exclusive control of processing all those recovered from the Titans. We have the techniques, equipment and experience in researching human-xeno interactions. Only after being subjected to an intensive battery of examinations should these subjects have their civil rights and freedoms returned.”
