* Starport Attacks Continue

/26 Jan 3304/

Two further starports have fallen prey to [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] attack: Kipling Orbital in the Pleiades Sector KC-V C2-11 and Malthus Terminal in the Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41. 

As with previous [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] assaults, the attacks have caused significant damage and resulted in huge numbers of casualties. 

A member of starport personnel at Kipling Orbital offered the following: 

“It seems the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] are sweeping the region, moving slowly in the direction of the core systems. But why?” 

Authorities in the affected systems have issued requests for help, imploring independent pilots to deliver aid and evacuate civilians.
