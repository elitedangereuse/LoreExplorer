* Freelance Report: The Crab Nebula Expedition

/17 Jun 3302/

A fleet of over 400 survey and support vessels has departed from Mitterand Hollow in [[id:d40886f3-bc59-4f0d-8926-b125ee01c9bb][Epsilon Indi]]. The Crab Nebula Expedition is the largest coordinated flight of explorers since the Distant Worlds Expedition. It has attracted a wide range of pilots, from veterans to beginners taking their first trip outside the bubble.  

The goal of the Expedition is a detailed planetary and mineral survey of tens of thousands of systems outwards of [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]], focusing on the regions around many well-known nebulae. The expedition is expected to reach the Crab Nebula on the 5th of July 3302, with the survey completed and the data returned in early August. 

[[id:d512672e-8849-46f9-b39d-a53f0c5765bf][Felicity Farseer]] and [[id:887ca01b-ea5d-4fcd-a45d-de1ca598f1cd][Elvira Martuuk]] have personally refitted many of the exploration vessels. With both engineers claiming that their designs provide the best performance, this will be a major test for both.
