* Sirius and Utopia Compete to Host Galactic Summit

/21 Jan 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Rival initiatives to arrange a diplomatic conference have been launched by Sirius Corporation and the Utopia commune. 

The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have each provisionally agreed to send delegates to the first tri-superpower Galactic Summit in late February. This political gathering will also be attended by representatives from independent systems. 

All parties have specified that their participation depends upon the event being successfully organised in neutral territory, and with sufficient resources and security in place.  

Sirius Corporation and Utopia have begun to gather supplies to host the conference. Both have requested assistance from the galactic community to provide a broad range of data, which will be vital for planning security operations. Whichever organisation obtains the greatest amount of data will be deemed most suitable. 

The following data sources are of interest to both parties: anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files. 

Simguru [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] has called upon all pilots who support Utopiaâ€™s proposal to deliver the data to Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system. 

CEO Li Yong-Rui has asked all those who believe Sirius Corporation to be a more suitable host to deliver the data to Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.
