* 0223 Faulcon Delacy's Beginnings
[[id:0da8edee-c8ff-4aed-9ff9-ce8ae998bef3][Reorte]]  

One of the most famous names in the history of interstellar
exploration. The corporation began life as a much smaller
organisation. Faulcon Manspace, a military supply organisation based
on Reorte. They first rose to prominencse when they developed a new
fighter craft they christined the Viper.

In this new era of the emerging interstellar privateer, Faulcon
Manspace devoted its production to Vipers, but worked on a number of
other designs too.

[[id:6da1c424-2b8f-4612-9c68-415c9ce6aed7][Faulcon Manspace]] merged with [[id:2d15cbf6-9087-4a09-8e24-a31b6b404ad8][deLacy ShipWorks]] in 3034, one of the many
shipyards building Faulcon ships under license.

One of the first new products from the merged company was the troubled
Cobra MkII. This was an upgraded version of the now very dated Cobra
MkI, but was not especially successful and was soon withdrawn.

Despite this, the new company grew into a corporate behemoth, and went
from strength to strength, launching the Cobra MkIII to great acclaim
in 3100.
