* 0223 Faulcon Delacy's Beginnings
[[id:0da8edee-c8ff-4aed-9ff9-ce8ae998bef3][Reorte]]  

One of the most famous names in the history of interstellar
exploration. The corporation began life as a much smaller
organisation. [[id:6da1c424-2b8f-4612-9c68-415c9ce6aed7][Faulcon Manspace]], a military supply organisation based
on [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]]. They first rose to prominencse when they developed a new
fighter craft they christined the [[id:369150fa-848e-401e-9ce6-373f1453e405][Viper]].

In this new era of the emerging interstellar privateer, Faulcon
Manspace devoted its production to Vipers, but worked on a number of
other designs too.

[[id:6da1c424-2b8f-4612-9c68-415c9ce6aed7][Faulcon Manspace]] merged with [[id:2d15cbf6-9087-4a09-8e24-a31b6b404ad8][deLacy ShipWorks]] in 3034, one of the many
shipyards building Faulcon ships under license.

One of the first new products from the merged company was the troubled
[[id:01919e58-48f2-411c-b504-6b0c5af7e679][Cobra MkII]]. This was an upgraded version of the now very dated [[id:88e6f76e-58eb-4f88-b301-e94e237b18a6][Cobra MkI]],
but was not especially successful and was soon withdrawn.

Despite this, the new company grew into a corporate behemoth, and went
from strength to strength, launching the [[id:2588102a-6025-451e-bd68-22906a8a09e0][Cobra MkIII]] to great acclaim
in 3100.
