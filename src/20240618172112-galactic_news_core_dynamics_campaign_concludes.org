* Galactic News: Core Dynamics Campaign Concludes

/29 Dec 3303/

Core Dynamics has announced that its construction initiative has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering construction materials to Klimuk Ring, and by eliminating agitators in the Guaras system. The materials will be used to support a new wave of manufacture to replace ships lost in Thargoid attacks. 

A spokesperson for Core Dynamics released the following statement: 

“We are immensely grateful to the galactic community for its support. The acceleration of our production schedule has already begun, and our new ships should be rolling off the production line soon.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Klimuk Ring in the Guaras system.
