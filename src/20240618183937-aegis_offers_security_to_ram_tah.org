* Aegis Offers Security to [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]

/30 Nov 3304/

Aegis has stationed a security force in the Meene system to protect the engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]. 

An announcement was made by Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]]: 

[[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]’s research has been enormously beneficial to our understanding of the Thargoids, and resulted in developments that aid us in the conflict. We therefore have a vested interest in protecting his work.” 

“We have deployed a security force that will provide continual support while allowing [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]’s operation to remain completely independent. Hopefully this will prevent any further disruption.” 

There has been no response from the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], which recently arrested a cabal of junior officers from its private fleet for launching an incursion into Meene. [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]], the CEO of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]] has allegedly withdrawn his offer to work with [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] on Guardian-human technology.
