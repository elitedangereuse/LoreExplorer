/09 Mar 3309/

Archon Delaine has rejected Prime Minister Mahon’s warning over an alleged attempt to gain control of systems in the California Nebula. 

“Wake up, Old Man Mahon!” Delaine said in a public broadcast. “The Kumo Crew migrated into the nebula with help from some mutual friends of ours… people you now consider allies. You like to portray us as criminals lusting for power and influence, but the real crooks are much closer to home. Rather than watching us, you should try looking over your shoulder.” 

Independent journalist Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse published his observations via the Rewired network: 

“Watching two of Sirius Corporation’s business partners openly fight like this must be making Li Yong Rui cringe as much as his poker face allows. What’s that? You never heard of the most powerful megacorp in history dealing with pirates? Surely not!” 

“Delaine is clearly referring to 3307, when he somehow convinced Kavanagh Spaceframes to build him five Orbis stations. One of these, California Freeport in HIP 18390, planted the Kumo flag in the nebula and served as the base for the gang’s recent attempt to seize Allied assets there.” 

“It was never revealed how the syndicate funded the construction of the starports. Or why Sirius Corporation subsidiaries appeared in those systems around the same time. But you don’t have to hire the Wallglass Agency to find a connection there.” 

“Oh and by the way, Kavanagh Spaceframes was renamed Rackham Spaceframes following its purchase by Rackham Capital Investments last year. What’s that? The trillionaire and the pirates working together as well? Surely not!”
