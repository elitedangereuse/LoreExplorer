* Azimuth Plans Corporate Convention

/10 Jul 3309/

[[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] has announced an invitation-only event for prospective business partners and military liaisons. 

CEO [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] provided a statement to the media: 

“New opportunities have emerged for Azimuth to resume the lead in
anti-xeno operations. With Thargoid fleets rampaging through the core
systems, and Aegis’s questionable policy of providing utility modules
over increased firepower, humanity’s defence once again falls to
us. But our organisation will no longer work in solitude.”

“I have extended the hand of partnership to selected financiers,
military figures, research groups and manufacturing companies. They
are invited to convene and discuss methods of helping us to resist the
evil of the Thargoids.”

Business analyst [[id:d4e49144-20cb-468e-b3ce-f594c2b5bf13][Marlon Royce]] published this report via [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]: 

“Ostensibly, this appears to be a public relations exercise for
[[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]]. However, the company’s relative lack of support from
independent pilots in a recent Thargoid tissue sample initiative has
accelerated the company’s search for allies. Rumours among the tech
community hint that the convention precedes the announcement of a
weapon schematic redesign to whet the appetite of investors.”

“Azimuth is using private couriers to transport guests to and from the
convention, entirely at its own expense. This generous professional
courtesy also guarantees anonymity for attendees, making it difficult
to determine who is on Rademaker’s guest list. Given nerves over
Operation Wych Hunt disruption, this seems a wise choice.”

“We do know that [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] and [[id:dc43c6e8-41ca-4962-ac24-6a0adfbe3518][Space Lanes Cargo]] are sending
representatives. [[id:e2aa0fa0-b034-4cd4-a3fd-4cbb7a2ce273][Aanya Gupta]], CEO of [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]],
also agreed to meet with the rival [[id:4e827915-3759-4040-97d0-346eac70fb5e][xeno-researcher]]. But the rest are
avoiding being publicly associated with [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]], which faced
enormous criticism for its role in the Battle of [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] and the
Thargoids’ subsequent retaliation.”
