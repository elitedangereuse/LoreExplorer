variant of the synthetic psychoactive drug based on a closely guarded
secret recipe. While active, it causes the user to lock their teeth
together and rapidly exhale, a reaction that led to its street name,
Fesh. This variant was created from a stolen recipe for Wolf 1301 Fesh
and is the closest Fesh variant in terms of quality to the
original. Banned in most jurisdictions.
