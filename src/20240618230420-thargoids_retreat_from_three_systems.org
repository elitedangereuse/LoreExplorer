* Thargoids Retreat from Three Systems

/29 Sep 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The conflicts in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems have ended with the withdrawal of Thargoid vessels. 

All three systems reported the simultaneous arrival of Thargoid forces on the 12th of September, following an expansion of their presence from HIP 22460. Unlike many previous incursions, however, no starports came under direct attack. 

Large numbers of independent pilots volunteered to defend the systems’ populations. Commanders BL1P, EmulatedPenguin and Klemyr, in particular, distinguished themselves in battle against the Thargoids, setting an example among many skilled pilots and AX squadrons that took part. 

The Federal Navy also sent several Farragut-class battle cruisers, each outfitted with specialist AX weaponry, to directly engage the Thargoids. These have now been redeployed, with Fleet Admiral [[id:b185e009-c014-443d-b73b-63b625ebfec6][Tayo Maikori]] claiming: “The overwhelming firepower of the Federation’s capital ships proved more than a match for our alien foe.” 

However, other sources claimed that the Thargoid fleets were not completely spent and instead made a tactical withdrawal. Several witnesses, interviewed by Vox Galactica field reporters, claim to have observed large numbers of undamaged Thargoid vessels departing into hyperspace. 

The formally organised defence operations have already concluded, but contributing pilots can still collect their rewards from Bennington's Rest in the 42 n Persei system, Samuda Terminal in the Chun Pindit system, and Riemann Colony in the Tekkeitjal system.
