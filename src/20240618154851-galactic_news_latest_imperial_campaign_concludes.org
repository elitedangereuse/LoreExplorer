* Galactic News: Latest Imperial Campaign Concludes

/28 Jul 3302/

Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage system, has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by delivering thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The organisation is now in a position to proceed with its campaign to construct three new Majestic-class Interdictors.
