[[id:77a7a843-4242-4da8-a764-c1525e6ceefe][Ackwada]]

The official discovery of this system and its habitable planet is
nowadays sccredited to [[id:4cf8f542-dfcf-4d54-88ea-2f136e760a4a][Augustus Brenquith]], although the Rockforth
Corporation claim the land deeds and development rights to the
system. Thirty nine years after the Corporation declared the system
its own; an ancient message capsule (a common way for sending messages
at the time) was recovered from outside the orbit of Jupiter in the
Sol syste,.

The discovery aroused considerable interest amongst archeologists on
Earth at the time while the capsule was in transit to the New Delhi
University there was heated debate as to whether the artefact should
be opened or not. When the capsule was studied, the seal was seen to
be broken, so the matter was resolved. Inside the capsule was a
message crystal with the log of the second five years of Augustus
Brenquith's solitary search for new worlds, his 'glittering lagacy',
included in the list of planetary systems that he had stumbled upon
was that of [[id:77a7a843-4242-4da8-a764-c1525e6ceefe][Ackwada]].
