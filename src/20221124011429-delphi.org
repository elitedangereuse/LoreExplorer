Delphi, originally designated [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55]] until
December 11, 3304, is an [[id:e0a6f2e0-36a9-4c35-b837-4ac3c6fc67a9][independent]] system near the [[id:7e99a467-6e3d-418e-8b10-72cf3660efa6][Pleiades Nebula]]
in the Inner Orion Spur. It was once the primary base of operations
for the Aegis Research division of [[id:a6b33331-c1bb-44cf-9717-f72eb0f63c99][Aegis]], a multinational initiative
founded in 3303 by scientists from the Federation, Empire, and
Alliance to study and develop countermeasures against the
Thargoids. Aegis Research's headquarters was the [[id:83cc5ab9-e42c-4049-b6ed-081927b0b286][starport]] Donar's Oak.

Since the onset of the [[id:9a246121-0c2e-4f21-9877-ee333d6b0d6c][Second Thargoid War]], Delphi has been a hotbed
of Thargoid activity; the wreckage of various [[id:594f1645-06bb-4327-b737-cb0e87cc6c73][Bulk Cruiser Megaships]]
lies strewn across the system, and The Oracle notably suffered an
attack on December 14, 3303. The Sentinel, a Military [[id:2e6601b2-93e0-4748-8182-938fbb3454ad][Installation]],
was completed on June 28, 3304 to help Delphi better defend itself
against external military incursions.

On May 24, 3307, it was reported that The Oracle, one of several
starports recently attacked by the Thargoids over the collection of
Guardian artefacts that had been amassed aboard the [[id:4d4f19a9-5100-4307-ac1b-f40ae90e806c][Alexandria]], had at
one point lost its alignment thrusters and nearly plummeted to the
surface of Delpi 5 a, which would have killed the thousands of people
aboard. A similar problem was also experienced at other damaged
starports. Fortunately, station engineers resolved the cascading
systems failure that had endangered The Oracle, and all of the
affected starports were restored to stable orbits. Fearing this could
be a new Thargoid tactic, station staff across the galaxy rushed to
address the design vulnerability before it could be exploited
again.[1]
