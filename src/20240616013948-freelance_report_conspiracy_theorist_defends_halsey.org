* Freelance Report: Conspiracy Theorist Defends Halsey

/09 May 3302/

Notorious conspiracy theorist [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]], speaking from the
[[id:6db801f4-9e17-46a2-8412-827e3064c370][Groombridge 34]] system, has issued a statement of support for former
Federal president [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]]:

"They're calling Halsey crazy, but she may just be a modern-day Joan
of Arc â€“ a conduit chosen by the [[id:bf186b14-e66d-4298-99b5-600f43d763c8][Architects of Creation]] to speak to
mankind. The powers-that-be want to silence her by locking her away. I
demand that I and a small group of scientists be granted an audience
with President Halsey so we can find out the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]]."

Bentonio recently made headlines after issuing a plea for cartographic
data to prove that the 29th of February was an 'aberrant day'
heralding the imminent collapse of the universe. What Mr Bentonio did
with that data, and whether it helped to prove or disprove his
theories, has not been released to the public.
