* Thargoid Conflict Discussed at the Galactic Summit

/09 Mar 3307/

Potential solutions to the threat posed by the Thargoid race are being debated at the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system. 

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling reported for Vox Galactica: 

“As always, the topic of the Thargoids brings division. The Alliance delegation has portrayed the aliens as a universal danger, while the Empire and Federation took a more balanced view.” 

“Professor Alba Tesreau’s plea to increase support for Aegis was well received, but many delegates argued that further anti-xeno breakthroughs were needed to justify additional funding. To this end, Aegis will undertake new research into the Guardians, hoping to discover a technological advantage from that ancient species.” 

“Prime Minister Mahon’s proposal for strategic cooperation against the Thargoids – known as the Sirius Treaty – is now being examined in detail. Supporters view it as a logical progression from the recently agreed Cornelius-Lasky Convention.” 

“There was minor uproar when [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] agreed to be a signatory. Coupled with similar commitments from the Marlinist Colonies and other independents, this has brought pressure upon the Empire and Federation to follow suit.” 

“If ratified, the Sirius Treaty could be the crowning achievement of the conference. However, putting it into practice will require a huge influx of resources. Decisions are expected before the end of this week.”
