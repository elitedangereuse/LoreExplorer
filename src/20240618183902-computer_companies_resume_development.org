* Computer Companies Resume Development

/28 Sep 3304/

Rival companies [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] and [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] have resumed development of their new personal computers. 

Harlow Nassry, technology journalist at [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]], has been following events: 

“After the mysterious fire that destroyed [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]]’s factory and the equally mysterious scandal that scared off [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]’s investors, it seemed like neither company would complete its new designs.” 

“But successful requests for public support have turned that around. [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]] and [[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]], the heads of Herculean and [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] respectively, both received enough materials to produce functional prototypes for the [[id:9d064da0-7be3-4c7b-99ad-0edd1585d4ca][Rackham Ultratech Expo]] on Wednesday the 3rd of October.” 

“This expo is crucial for both companies. Rackham Capital Investments and other corporate sponsors will be paying close attention, and Zachary Rackham himself will be present, eager to get his hands on the latest gadgets.” 

“Both the customisable Duradrive and the wearable Torc have captured the public imagination, but the prototypes’ performance is key. The amount of commodities each company received might be the deciding factor in their commercial success.”
