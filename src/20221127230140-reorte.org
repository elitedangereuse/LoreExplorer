* 0122 Reorte Reclaimed                                 :beacon:EliteHistory:
After three weeks of fighting in the [[id:74ee28a5-5fb5-4dbe-ace0-179d66a409be][Lave Cluster]], the [[id:1edf2869-2f9f-41c4-874c-e5971e385b75][Alliance Elite
Diplomatic Corps]] (AEDC) managed to reclaim Reorte from a pirate
insurgency. Early in April 3301, a local pirate group had tried to
rename the cluster the "New Caribbean", but undercover AEDC agents
worked with local groups to retake control of [[id:aeb2ca41-e6ea-499c-a58e-7bc4427df58b][Davies High]].
