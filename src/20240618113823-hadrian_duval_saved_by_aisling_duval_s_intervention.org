* Hadrian Duval Saved by [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]’s Intervention

/02 Nov 3306/

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] has provided lifesaving aid to Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, who was severely wounded by [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] terrorists. 

The INV Achenar's Courage, transported her to the Paresa system where she offered protection against further assassination attempts.  

Hadrian Duval was transferred to the Majestic-class Interdictor’s medical bay, surrounded by both his Praetorian Guard and Imperial troops. He received advanced treatment including Vitadyne nanomeds, and is no longer in critical condition. 

This unorthodox intervention has drawn both criticism and praise from senators and public alike. Nova Imperium is outlawed for sedition due to its isolationist policies, and its leader is not recognised by the Imperial Family. However, a non-aggression pact was agreed between Aisling and Hadrian in 3305. 

A defiant [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] told The Imperial Herald: 

“I recently lost one member of my family to these extremists. I am not about to lose another. Regardless of politics, Hadrian is my cousin, and there are precious few Duvals left alive.” 

Nova Imperium’s head of security, Praetor Leo Magnus, commented: 

“I am confident that our Imperator would have survived, but we do appreciate Her Highness’s assistance. It remains a mystery how the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] could come so close to succeeding, but my investigations continue.”
