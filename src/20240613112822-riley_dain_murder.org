* 0120 Riley Dain Murder
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

In 3184, the election of Federation President [[id:691ec616-5efd-4f3c-bb2a-11db8b3901f9][Loric Trander]] saw a
renewal of hostilities over Alioth. This time, conflict was instigated
by corporate rivalry in the system's vast gas mining sector. After the
discovery of a murdered official named [[id:fa8094c2-7d96-448e-b4e2-a675e0214ef1][Riley Dain]] who was
investigating the abuse of permitted quotas, the situation quickly
escalated. Trander authorised a force off privateers. In response
[[id:8dc482e7-e978-4e6e-8a63-600e61cd715f][Hesketh Duval]] sent in the [[id:c7f194da-b6b0-4ba2-9d18-951da3a8bf7b][Imperial XV fleet]].

The conflict avoided the settlement of New California, owing to the
previous treaty, but the settlers there found themselves all but cut
off until a further ceasefire was established in 3198. Neither side
achieved anything but line the pockets of the industries who fuelled
and powered their fleets. It also served to stir further resentment
amongst the settlers. At this time, the [[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Caker]] insurrection became more
organised and received substantial financial support from unknown
sources.
