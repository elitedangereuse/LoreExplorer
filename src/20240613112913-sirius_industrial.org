Sirius Industrial makes a broad range of bespoke heavy industrial
installations for smelting, refining, processing and
manufacturing. There are largely automated and easily assembled on
site, using local materials for key elements of the construction where
possible. All are centred around large [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] power reactors - often
multiple 100GW units are used in a single plant.
