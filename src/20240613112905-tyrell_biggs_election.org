* 0193 Tyrell Biggs' Election
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]

The election of [[id:51cb3ba1-6a48-478b-a5db-f002c889c477][Tyrell Biggs]] from [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] to the office of President in
3008, saw another change in approach. Biggs had been a Congressman for
Mars for a long time, and made extensive use of his diplomatic
connections throughout his tenure. During his election, he talked a
great deal about the use of diplomacy rather than force.

In 3008 during a lull in the fighting in Alioth, Federal diplomats
secretly approached the Imperial court with a proposition that Achenar
and its subsidiary systems join the Federation as full members.

This had been attempted before, and had been met with Imperial
derision. The proposition included clauses and amendments that would
have allowed the Imperial system to qualify for membership despite the
differences between Federal and Imperial law on several
matters. However, the leak of the documents by Federal [[id:de12e7c6-dc67-403d-bdd5-aadb52313312][spies]] to other
Imperial systems caused widespread unrest, which might have been
Biggs' intention all along. For the next decade, this cooled
Imperial/Federal realtions and caused distrust on both sides.
