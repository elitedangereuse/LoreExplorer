* Building a New Ship - BD+03 2338

/23 Feb 3301/

Despite [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]]'s strong words during yesterday's press conference, President Halsey has refused the Admiral's request to send additional forces for the attack on Polahukuna. 

In response, the Federal Navy, in conjunction with Core Dynamics, has declared their intention to commission the creation of a new capitol ship. The new ship will be built in the recently recaptured shipyards of BD+03 2338, and the Admiral's personal contingent will remain in the locale in order to protect the construction of the new vessel.
