* Week in Review

/19 Aug 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

Campaigner [[id:5fdbd5d4-1f5f-4984-8876-4bee1d590dd7][Jarl Toredo]] has disclosed that he and Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] have been conducting a secret romantic relationship, despite her betrothal to Federal Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]]. Toredo claims that the princess accepted Rochester’s proposal only as a means to advance her political plans. Princess Duval has refuted Toredo’s statement. 

Dr [[id:2bf69df4-bf62-4877-87eb-5158254f5fcb][Alfred Ulyanov]], a leading exotheologian and an authority on the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult, has been apprehended as a suspected Thargoid sympathiser. The Federal Intelligence Agency said that Dr Ulyanov’s involvement with the Far God cult made him a valid person of interest. 

Meanwhile, [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]] has highlighted two new personal computer designs currently in development – the Torc from [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], and the Duradrive from [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]. Both companies plan to reveal prototypes of their designs at a technology expo in October. 

A mining robot that went out of control in the Beta Hydri system has been located and disabled. MacArthur Mining Ltd, which manufactures the robot, said that an inspection of the robot’s remains confirmed suspicions that it had been placed in the incorrect standby mode, verifying that the malfunction was the result of human error. 

In other news, billionaire [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] has been confirmed as the winner of a lottery prize of one billion credits. Rackham was quick to announce that he would donate his winnings to charity, although [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]] pointed out that the win coincided with a bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to Rackham’s company. 

Finally, a spokesperson for Aegis Research has announced that its rescue operation in the Pleiades has been enthusiastically assisted by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the operation by delivering stranded survivors and commodities to Donar's Oak. 

And those are the main stories this week.
