* A New Dawn for Humanity?

/07 Nov 3310/

With the Thargoid invasion force seemingly on the edge of defeat,
political analysts have presented several arguments for what follows.

The potential balance of power across the core systems will be heavily
influenced by the ambitions of its primary players – perhaps crucially
in the Federation, claims [[id:f09c38ea-4dbd-4285-a74c-90ebfaee1100][Jean-Daniel Moulin]]:

“[[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][President Winters]] has finally taken up residence in the [[id:08d6421e-9b07-4a01-8df1-44f9dd51de59][White House]],
ready to face a multitude of challenges. A depressed war economy, mass
citizen displacement and a series of late-term policies implemented by
the outgoing [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] will keep her schedule full for
months. [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jeremy Archer]] stands opposite her in [[id:614fd344-ec09-483c-a28e-0289590946c4][Congress]], ready to pounce
on any signs of weakness and eager to fully emerge from the long
shadow of [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Hudson]] as the true leader of the [[id:5f587ce0-8fb6-4535-aadf-e2f11154e6f6][Republican party]].”

On the Imperial front, [[id:745efc38-c548-40c0-81d2-82973c604d37][Cassia Carvalho]] of the [[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][Imperial Herald]] has
provided a summary of those most likely to benefit post-invasion:

“Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa]] remains the figurehead of Imperial authority, and the
successful navigation of military, migrant and domestic challenges has
only enhanced her popularity. Likewise for Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]],
whose tactical leadership during the Thargoid war reinforced his power
as Admiral of the Fleet. [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Princess Aisling]] enjoys glowing praise from
[[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] figures as part of the Imperial delegation to the [[id:191fb0ed-5a88-4a49-a98d-e25794c5b36b][anti-xeno
initiative]], particularly her focus on humanitarian operations. And
Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] seems poised to assume the position of
Chancellor in the near future. What comes next for the continued glory
of the Empire?”

In the Alliance, [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Prime Minister Mahon]] faces his strongest opposition
for some time in the Alliance, according to [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] of the
[[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][Alliance Tribune]]:

“There have been some accusations towards the [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Prime Minister]] of a lack
of decisive leadership during the Thargoid invasion. His reliance on a
military pact with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] to enhance the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence
Force]]’s AX capabilities awoke key dissenters to Mahon's otherwise
popular rule – most notably from Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]], whose
anti-corporate stance and strong devotion to the Alliance’s founding
ideals have won her plenty of support.”

Various newsfeeds discussed other figures: [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]’s
continued influence over many aspects of the corporate landscape gives
CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] considerable power. [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]], Simguru of the
[[id:058a658d-e1ce-4364-a92b-b9607495c73f][Utopia]], leads a far smaller but vital community of devotees convinced
of their guide’s future-tech vision.

[[id:b4892958-b513-46dc-b74e-26887b53f678][Yuri Grom]] remains a prominent independent fleet commander – viewed as
a principled liberator to some, and a ruthless dictator to
others. Finally, the Pirate King [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]]’s recent targeted
attacks on [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Emperor Arissa]] and [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Shadow President Archer]] suggests he sees
an opportunity to expand his criminal influence in the early
post-Invasion era.
