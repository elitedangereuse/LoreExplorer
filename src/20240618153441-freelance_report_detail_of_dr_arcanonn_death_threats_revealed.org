* Freelance Report: Detail of [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] Death Threats Revealed

/05 Feb 3302/

Nelson De Rosa, chief of security for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has released a statement to the media: 

[[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] has been receiving threats from crackpots for months, but this time the threat was more credible: that if he visited Professor Palin in [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] he would be 'terminated'. A meeting between the two scientists had indeed been planned, but was not common knowledge." 

"We've now determined that Socha Korbemile, the doctor's research assistant, had been leaking sensitive information to an unknown source for some time. We are now probing possible links to Varati-based groups that have previously obstructed our research, and to the intruders who infiltrated Christian Dock in November last year." 

"We are also looking for Dr Huros, whose militant views on alien life have previously brought him into conflict with [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]]. I want to eliminate him from our investigation as soon as possible, so I would appreciate any information on his whereabouts." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
