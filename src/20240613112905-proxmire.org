* 0194 'Proxmire'
[[id:51a92498-ef1b-4fc3-9ad7-9e49fb947353][Cemiess]]

In 3022, [[id:9492a08d-0edc-46db-969f-dc8670665346][Raul Santorini]] became Governor of [[id:da11b7b5-2c5a-4f17-9cd4-ce28a2f34dbd][Tau Ceti]] and through his
Corporate connections, controlled the system's congressional
seat. Santorini, nicknamed 'Proxmire' due to an obscure historical
reference, was one of the very few Federal politicians to achieve
significant interstellar status. He achieved substantial popularity
during his early tenure as Governor by winning a significant tax
rebate for the system from Congress, but also championed deep cuts in
the [[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal Navy]] and throughout government, remaining as governor for
an astonishing 76 years up until his assassination in 3098.
