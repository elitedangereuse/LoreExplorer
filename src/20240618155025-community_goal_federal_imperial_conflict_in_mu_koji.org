* Community Goal: Federal-Imperial Conflict in [[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]]

/08 Sep 3302/

Security operatives in [[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]] have reported that the Empire and Federation have launched rival military operations in the system. 

Both superpowers have fleets stationed in [[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]], and both have launched attacks against these convoys with the aim of securing valuable enemy intelligence.  

The Xuangu Crimson Major Network has been authorised to coordinate the Imperial operation, while rival organisation the [[id:b134728d-ea83-43c0-af4d-c212b8a0dd91][Mu Koji]] Resistance is directing the Federal campaign. Both factions have asked independent combat pilots for support, promising to reward those who come to their aid. 

The rival operations are scheduled to run for one week from the 8th of September 3302.
