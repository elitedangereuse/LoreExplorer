*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition has succeeded in forcing [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] to withdraw from the Reorte system. 

Despite the megacorp’s strategic defence pact with the Alliance, [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]]’s controlling faction claimed the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] megaship Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] was an illegal intruder. This resulted in open conflict, which has ended with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]]ration’s defeat. 

Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition, transmitted this message: 

“With the support of many brave pilots, we have prevented [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] from sinking its claws into the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system. I hope our victory will convince the Alliance’s leaders to think twice about their deal with the devil.” 

Captain Delfina Dominguez has confirmed that [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] has started to withdraw from [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]]. The megaship Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] will leave Reorte and jump to the Leesti system pending further discussions with Allied leaders. 

Sources have confirmed that permits to the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] and [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] systems have been allocated to independent pilots depending on the faction they supported during the conflict. 

The Assembly has held emergency meetings to debate this turn of events. Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system, delivered a warning to Prime Minister Mahon: 

“You have invited [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] to provide military aid against the Thargoids, but without seeking the approval of those we are pledged to protect. That is not the way of the Alliance, no matter how grave the threat.”
