* Hudson Takes Tour of Brightlight Facilities in [[id:f2073346-7947-49de-9834-590324ffba84][Hors]]

/07 Apr 3301/

Shadow President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Hudson]], accompanied by several of [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]]’s
closest aides, received a warm greeting when he visited the [[id:f2073346-7947-49de-9834-590324ffba84][Hors]]
system earlier today. The group met with [[id:81d18607-11d9-4c7e-aed2-a8c07f7485fa][Duke Sanders]] to discuss the
possibility of extending the remit of Brightlight Training’s Federal
contracts.

Representing the gold standard in private training centres,
Brightlight offers a variety of educational services to corporations
throughout the Federation. With the recent failures in communication
between the Commander-in-Chief and her advisors in the Federal Navy,
it appears that [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]] has decided it is long past time for
the Navy to update the way its officers are trained.

Sources within the [[id:53a50eef-50cc-46c9-983b-548c67ddf358][Brightlight Training Corporation]] are said to be
very happy with the way the meeting went. No new contracts have been
agreed between the two parties, but all reports indicate that
Brightlight has begun ramping up its operations in preparation for an
imminent services deployment.
