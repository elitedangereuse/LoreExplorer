* Alliance Strives to Retain [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]]

/18 Mar 3308/

The megaship Trobairitz has arrived in the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system to support the efforts of the Reorte Pro-Alliance League. 

In recent weeks, the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system has forced the expulsion of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation and refused to accept the strategic defence pact. Since then, there have been proposals from its controlling faction to renounce Allied membership and declare independence. But this has galvanised others to campaign for Reorte to remain in the Alliance. 

Louisa Leblanc, chief administrator of the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Pro-Alliance League, gave a statement to The Alliance Tribune: 

“The proposed partnership with [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation Is restricted to increasing defences against the Thargoids. We do not believe this will be disruptive enough to justify losing all the myriad benefits of membership in the Alliance.” 

“The [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Pro-Alliance League is pleased to be supported by the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] Independents faction. A megaship, the Trobairitz, has been supplied to us and will serve as the centre of our campaign for Reorte to remain an Allied system.” 

Sirius Corporation has officially stated that this situation is an internal matter for the Alliance. Sources within the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] Independents suggest that [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation delegates has been briefed on the situation.
