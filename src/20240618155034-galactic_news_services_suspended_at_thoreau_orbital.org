* Galactic News: Services Suspended at Thoreau Orbital

/22 Sep 3302/

Personnel at Thoreau Orbital in the Obotrima system have been forced to suspend various services â€“ a direct result of an Imperial campaign to destabilise the starport by flooding it with explosives. 

As a major manufacturing centre for autonomous defence drones, more commonly known as skimmers, the station was considered a priority target by the Empire. 

A member of startport personnel, who chose to remain anonymous, said: 

"The Federal Navy knew this attack was coming, but they did nothing. The independent pilots who delivered skimmer components did a great job, but without military support, how could they hope to foil the Empire's plan? Now Thoreau Orbital is in dire shape. Who knows how long it'll be before things are back to normal."
