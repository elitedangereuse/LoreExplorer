* Presidential Campaigns Target Federal Voters

/22 May 3309/

Jerome Archer, [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] and [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] are lobbying for public support as the Federation prepares to elect a new president in August. 

Political correspondent [[id:e660f840-caed-45ef-985e-f75170cf9ca8][Sofia Trevino]] covered the race for [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“With [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]]’s eight-year term approaching its end, citizens must decide who will be the president of the Federation by the year’s end. The electoral machines for all three candidates are in full swing, with campaign slogans appearing at all Federal starports.” 

“The Republican Party has pinned its hopes on current Vice President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]], who hopes to reassure Hudson loyalists with his similar leadership style and focus on interstellar security. Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]], head of the Liberal Party, is promising a more humanitarian approach to government policy. And the wild card is independent candidate [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]], whose wealth and notoriety afford him a fighting chance against the political heavyweights.” 

“Congress has confirmed that, with many government procedures impacted by the Thargoid war, election day has been delayed until later in the year. President Hudson is expected to remain in office for the interim period before the victor's official inauguration.” 

Vox Galactica reporter Patricia Chen analysed the media coverage: 

“Typically, Federal newsfeeds focus more on character than policies. The Federal Free Press obtained in-depth interviews with Winters and [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]], while [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] Today published souvenir editions celebrating Hudson’s presidency as a ‘golden age’. On the fringes are those such as [[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE-caster]] [[id:f3e0128c-f8fd-4b90-a2c0-0ae5a5e487d0][Sura Oyekan]], who promotes voting for Rackham as a way to revolutionise society.” 

“What is not typical is that this election is being held during wartime. The ongoing Thargoid conflict has cast a shadow over voters’ optimism for the future. Some are even wondering if this might be the last president they ever elect, should the alien invasion of the core systems prove unstoppable.”
