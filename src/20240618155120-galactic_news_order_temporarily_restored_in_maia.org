* Galactic News: Order Temporarily Restored in Maia

/17 Nov 3302/

The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has announced that its operation to weaken Maia's criminal network has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's appeal for support, taking to their ships to eliminate the agitators operating in the system. 

The victory may give the Pleiades Resource Enterprise the time it needs to recover its strength, and prepare for the next phase in its fight against the Ant Hill Mob. 

Pilots who contributed to the operation can collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital.
