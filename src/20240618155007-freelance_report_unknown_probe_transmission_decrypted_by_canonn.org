* Freelance Report: Unknown Probe Transmission Decrypted by Canonn

/20 Aug 3302/

The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has discovered, recorded and translated a tight-beam transmission from an Unknown Probe directed at [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] 5c. 

Research into the Probes has so far been hindered by their scarcity, but with the increasing number of Probes being found, transmission analysis efforts have ramped up, leading to successful decryption. The transmission was found to contain blocks of octal numbers describing planetary data such as radius, surface temperature, gravity and atmospheric composition. 

The nature of the 'receiver' on [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] 5c is now under investigation.
