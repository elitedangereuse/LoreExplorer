* Festive Imperial Campaigns End

/27 Dec 3304/

Initiatives to supply Imperial senator [[id:667b1421-4f11-4d0b-a701-154251e79522][Simone Leatrix]]’s festivities have reached a conclusion. 

Mass deliveries of food and jewels took place in the [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]] system. 

As the campaigns drew to a close, Senator Leatrix made this statement: 

“My gratitude goes to those who helped make this celebration possible. I hope the sight of my glittering mountaintop retreat serves as an inspiration in these times of civil disquiet.” 

Traders who supported the initiative can now collect their rewards from Mackenzie Relay in the [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]] system.
