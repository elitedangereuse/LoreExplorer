[[id:0da8edee-c8ff-4aed-9ff9-ce8ae998bef3][Reorte]]

After three weeks of fighting in the [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] Cluster, the Alliance Elite
Diplomatic Corps (AEDC) managed to reclaim [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] from a pirate
insurgency. Early in April 3301, a local pirate group had tried to
rename the cluster "New Caribbean", but undercover AEDC agents worked
with local groups to retake control of Davies High.
