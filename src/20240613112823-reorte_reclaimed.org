* 0122 Reorte Reclaimed
[[id:0da8edee-c8ff-4aed-9ff9-ce8ae998bef3][Reorte]]

After three weeks of fighting in the Lave Cluster, the Alliance Elite
Diplomatic Corps (AEDC) managed to reclaim Reorte from a pirate
insurgency. Early in April 3301, a local pirate group had tried to
rename the cluster "New Caribbean", but undercover AEDC agents worked
with local groups to retake control of Davies High.
