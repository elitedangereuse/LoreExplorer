* Galactic News: Peacock Patrons of Law Appeal Concludes

/16 Feb 3303/

A spokesperson for the Peacock Patrons of Law has announced that their appeal for robotics, ion distributors and emergency power cells has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Phillips Dock, the organisation's base of operations. 

The Peacock Patrons of Law have extended their gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Phillips Dock in the Peacock system.
