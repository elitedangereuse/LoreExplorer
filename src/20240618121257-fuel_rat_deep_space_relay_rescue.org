Fuel Rat Deep Space Relay Rescue 
 
The [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] received a distress call from Cmdr [[id:94da553f-7bd1-47c6-86d6-04325d367d15][Neospike]] as he
returned from [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]] when a broken fuel scoop left him
stranded over 3,600 light years from civilization. The Reboot/Repair
sequence failed to fix the fuel scoop.

Several commanders responded to the distress call, including [[id:7a203bd3-fb88-4152-b39b-36fce7a943a9][Domaq]],
[[id:85cdabdd-7a6e-4f90-a2b1-fe434fe3a786][Paul_Kavinsky]], [[id:f0a7a516-4d16-4e97-8bc0-f39d6844b92b][Rusticolus]], [[id:869ee4e0-8347-4300-ba60-73dbf5d092eb][Cpt_Shinobi]], [[id:06fffd5d-ab7b-4ea3-8270-cb078ba10782][Surly_badger]], and [[id:8c6e19e1-9523-4321-a333-41cacd7a47ee][Anuranium]].

Cmdr. Domaq quickly arrived on scene and provided an initial
refuelling to ensure the ship could remain powered while the other
ships moved into position.

A relay operation involving several ships and roughly 540 limpet
drones then proceeded. Speed was a priority due to the damage
Cmdr. Neospikeâ€™s ship had undergone leaving all of his systems at less
than 5%.

As of this reporting the Fuel Rat initiative has rescued over 190
stranded pilots.
