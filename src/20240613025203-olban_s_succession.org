* 0138 Olban's Succession
"In 2943, at the age of one hundred and fourteen, [[id:bd16de0c-b03f-4478-8921-934e7d589628][Trasken Duval III]]
died. His son [[id:164e5782-9d44-45d3-9bc7-f769de096303][Olban Hensard Duval]] succeeded him.

Olban's first action on the interstellar political stage marked a
different approach to his father. Imperial involvement in the disputes
in the Liaedin system, beginning in 2945, were subtle rather then
heavy-handed."
