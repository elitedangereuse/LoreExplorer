* Death of a Duval

/17 Sep 3306/

Imperial news sources have confirmed that Prince Harold Duval was assassinated by [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] terrorists while travelling incognito to the Cemiess system. 

Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] broadcast this address: 

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Prince Harold. A state funeral at the Hall of Martyrs is being arranged and there will be a period of mourning, as is customary for esteemed members of the Imperial Family. There will be opportunities for all citizens to honour Harold’s memory in an appropriate manner.” 

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]], Harold’s daughter, appeared uncharacteristically distressed when she gave a brief statement to the media: 

“It’s a huge loss to us all that… I’m sorry… I can’t believe this has happened. He can’t be gone! I used to have some sympathy for the Marlinists, but now they… they took him from us. They took my daddy.” 

The [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] also attacked starports in the Cemiess, Gabjaujis, LHS 4031 and Rabh systems.  

The Empire is now on heightened alert, and the Senate has approved new counter-terrorism initiatives proposed by Senator Denton Patreus.
