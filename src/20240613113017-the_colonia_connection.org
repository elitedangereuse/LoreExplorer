* 0681 The Colonia Connection
[[id:2de1afc0-4c9d-4e31-bc15-ba9961087ddd][Latugara]]

On September 15th 3302 [[id:da124470-044d-4d54-b5c1-53b7f4db1d43][Latugara PLC]]. an independent organization based
in the Latugara system, announced plans to construct a series of
outposts between the core of human-inhabited space and the rapidly
expanding [[id:c4711f62-d6d2-4a42-bfe1-c794c528663f][Colonia Nebula Community]].

In a statement, the organization's spokesperson said:

“Given the relatively remote nature of the Colonia community, there's
a clear need for a series of resupply outposts to support ships
travelling to and from the Colony. These new bases will bridge the gap
between the burgeoning Colonia community and the core systems.”
