Brookes Memorial Series – Beacon 2/5

The year is 3301. Star maps are drawn. Planets recorded. A galaxy of
endless possibility brought within reach. For the first time,
thousands of new pilots would strap themselves into a Commander’s
chair and fire up their engines. Millions more would follow, drawn
into a shifting spacescape of intrigue, conflict, and discovery.

Michael’s joy in helping bring this experience to so many was inherent
in the colour of the text. Emperors, presidents, heroes and villains
acquired depth and character. Alliances, federations and empires alike
grew inspired by his imagination, added textures and shades to an epic
saga. Michael’s contributions would guide others through the years, as
a foundation to maintain the epic saga he helped develop.
