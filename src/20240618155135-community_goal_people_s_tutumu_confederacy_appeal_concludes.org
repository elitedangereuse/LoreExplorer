* Community Goal: People's Tutumu Confederacy Appeal Concludes

/22 Dec 3302/

The People's Tutumu Confederacy has released a statement announcing the successful conclusion of its seasonal appeal. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, delivering huge quantities of goods to North Ring in the Tutumu system. 

In addition to offering generous premiums for the requested items, the People's Tutumu Confederacy also organised a special prize draw. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from North Ring in the Tutumu system.
