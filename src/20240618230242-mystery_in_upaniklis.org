* Mystery in [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]]

/20 May 3308/

A [[id:eb7f4d60-9116-4d68-a0c2-13ac1e74d72e][dredger clan]] is continuing to examine the [[id:a2db0282-aff7-4235-adf9-0aa79b018623][abandoned]] [[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][generation ship]]
[[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] in the [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system.

The [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] was placed in orbit around [[id:240cb7c7-e94f-46b8-bbda-021a0d0ea538][Upaniklis B 3]] in 3305 when its
inhabitants migrated to the nearby outpost [[id:76792c5b-c253-4b13-bb89-c29a266f2d39][Forester’s Choice]]. Over the
past week there have been reports of smaller craft travelling between
the [[id:c790ca5d-65c5-4e8e-a278-7fbd11a5f092][Artificers Clan]] dredger and the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]], but the nomadic tribe
has not responded to attempts to communicate.

Commander [[id:f5a998c2-26d4-4318-8f34-d85846b71d92][Javi Alvarado]], a regular visitor to the system, submitted
his observations to [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“I was convinced that these scavengers were breaking down the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]]
into scrap to feed to their dredger. Or maybe taking over the whole
ship to use as a new home. But I haven’t seen any signs of structural
damage yet, and it doesn’t look like the Artificers have accessed its
habitation areas either. So what are they up to?”

“Things are a little weird in Forester’s Choice right now. It doesn’t
seem anywhere near as busy, and many concourse vendors have closed
down. There’s almost a kind of religious hush. For centuries their
entire existence relied upon the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]], and its presence nearby was
reassuring. I think seeing outsiders interfere with it has affected
them deeply.”

The [[id:46ff5046-45e9-402d-93a3-96f9c1e508a3][Federal Diplomatic Corp]] published an official reminder that
Forester’s Choice has partner status with the Federation, adding: “As
a micro-society that evolved in isolation, the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]]n people are
legally protected against cultural contamination. We will continue to
monitor the Artificer Clan’s activity in the [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system.”
