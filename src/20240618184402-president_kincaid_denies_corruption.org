* President Kincaid Denies Corruption

/10 May 3305/

President Gibson Kincaid has refuted allegations of illegal campaign funding and is refusing to cooperate with the official inquiry. 

He gave this statement to The Alliance Tribune: 

“The claims are nothing more than an attempt to besmirch my reputation. Councillor Elijah Beck has fabricated this wild mudlark chase as revenge for his loss to me in the presidential vote last year.” 

“If the Assembly wants to entertain conspiracies, they could review the assassination of Fazia Silva, the third presidential candidate. It’s interesting that Beck’s own campaign gained a lot of support after Silva was murdered.” 

The [[id:e9439fe0-8637-4330-b5fd-b4f1643cf472][Bank of Zaonce]] has also declined the inquiry’s requests for information. A spokesperson insisted that all campaign funds it handles adhere to strict financial guidelines. They added that Beck’s evidence was deemed insufficient until a verified source could be provided.
