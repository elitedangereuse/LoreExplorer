Commander Schlack reports that on 6th September 3302, AEDC returned
this system to the control of Independent Leesti for Equality from a
year long domination of the system by the ruthless [[id:cce380e3-abc6-44f5-a266-e61bc17c1206][Justice Party]]
dictatorship. Their nefarious acts funded by the sales of [[id:41fa0a3d-4f14-44c1-b314-78882dcc37b3][Leestian
Evil Juice]] were put to an end.
