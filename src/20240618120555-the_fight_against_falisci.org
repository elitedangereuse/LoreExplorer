* The Fight Against [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]]

/27 Feb 3301/

There’s war brewing in the Empire, as despite a stern warning issued in their direction by Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]], the pirates of [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] continue to plunder innocent traders as they pass through on the way to ply their wares in Dongzi and [[id:36dc081e-5308-4677-978e-cd9eee894d1b][Ngaiawang]]. 

Things could soon change however, as reports are coming in that warships belonging to the Citizens of Tradition, a group well known for their support of Senator Patreus, have been spotted amassing on the borders of [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]]. 

When pressed for comment, Commander Shole of the Citizens of Tradition had this to say: 

“We’ve got our orders. No traders are going under on our watch. If those [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] scumbags so much as think about crossing this border, they’re going to wish they hadn’t.” 

Imperial Commanders willing to join the fight to defend imperial space should seek out the Citizens of Tradition aboard Dornier Terminal in [[id:36dc081e-5308-4677-978e-cd9eee894d1b][Ngaiawang]].
