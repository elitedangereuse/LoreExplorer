The Science of a Safer Society  
 
Thousands of Pegasi sector civilians were forced to evacuate their homes last week, following a series of brutal raids carried out in the name of Archon Delaine. 

Some resilient residents have attempted to reach out to [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and Empire homeworlds for assistance, but so far, their pleas for help have gone unanswered. This leaves the question on everyone’s lips: who will stop the Kumo Crew? 

Local business magnate, Pranav Antal, believes that his Utopians may well be able to provide an answer. 

“Their greed, their jealousy… these are the things that drive the Kumo to try to own, control and destroy everything they see.” 

“This desire for base things has led the crew down a dark path, one which has caused much pain for the people of Pegasi. We at Utopia understand their sorrow, their troubles, and we want to help.” 

“Agents of Utopia are seeking to open a new commune in Hip 116213. Once approved, our engineers will begin the dangerous process of establishing an enlightened defence against the uncivilised horde.”
