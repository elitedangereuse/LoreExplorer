* Aegis Forms Partnership with Ram Tah

/17 Apr 3305/

Aegis has entered into a partnership with the engineer Ram Tah to manufacture Guardian-related technology. 

Senior Engineer Lilith Galloway made the following statement on behalf of Aegis: 

“We believe that Ram Tah’s accomplishments, while impressive, represent only a fraction of what can be accomplished. We have therefore entered into an agreement that will allow Aegis to bring its considerable resources to bear in the manufacture of Guardian-related technology, both now and in the future.” 

Galloway confirmed that technology brokers would remain licensed distributors of the Trident, Javelin and Lance XG fighters. 

Ram Tah also gave a short statement to the media: 

“To me, Aegis represents what can be achieved when humanity pulls together, and I am delighted to be entering into this partnership.”
