* Azimuth Claim Expensive Success

/10 Nov 3308/

The recent [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] initiative to expand its operation assets has been described as a ‘partial success’. 

A primary goal of obtaining sufficient resources to establish a new anti-xeno megaship has been met, Azimuth CEO [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] announced. The megaship is expected to be operational within the next few weeks. 

Opponents of the weapons research corporation, seeking to disrupt the campaign, mobilised forces to engage Azimuth security vessels. While unable to prevent sufficient deliveries from reaching the Musashi, it is thought these pilots inflicted significant losses on the Azimuth fleet. 

“We are delighted with the support shown to [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] by independent pilots, and look to the future with optimism,” said Rademaker. “We will soon deploy a new AX megaship to lead our mobile operations. Setbacks inflicted by anarchic opponents of progress have delayed our plans to establish planetary research bases, however. This persistent antagonism will have to be resolved separately.” 

Along with credit rewards, qualifying pilots that contributed to the delivery campaign will receive the Mbooni permit shortly, granting access to Azimuth’s selection of AX weaponry. Rademaker confirmed that the Glorious Prospect megaship will now sell this permit from the T-Tauri system permanently. 

Pilots who fought for [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] will also receive overcharged Guardian plasma chargers in storage at the Musashi, providing they reaches the contribution threshold. Those who fought against Azimuth will receive rapid-fire multi-cannons with phasing sequence from Wandrama Purple Council soon, collectable from MacLean City.
