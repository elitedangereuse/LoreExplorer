* 0196 The Coming of Kum Byar
[[id:6935cefb-7739-4ac2-91a0-de4a984feae1][Arexack]]

In 3126, the Federal media's attention turned to the Arexack
system. [[id:1c6a2f27-09a7-4229-9f2d-5743474647f9][Zack Blackbeam]], the interstellar celebrity, socialite and
playboy staged a holoprojected light show in the system, called 'The
Coming of [[id:d4d70ceb-ba90-4c61-8bc1-3228411a3760][Kum Byar]]'. Tens of millions of Federal citizens watched as
the naive monks of the hermit like settlements were taken in by the
spectacle and led to believe they would be prevented from 'ascending
to the Highest Level of Paradise', owing to the 'displeasing shave' of
their leader His Magnificence the Right Holy [[id:9c8fb7e5-8955-4d19-8e9a-78c0b2a1f06e][Ssord Rettu III]]. The
comic farce quickly became serious when Rettu's acolytes [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassinated]]
him live on interstellar television and the system descended into a
violent, religious, civil war.
