* Thargoid War Bulletin: Second Titan Defeated

/18 Mar 3310/

Titan Leigong in the HIP 8887 system has been eliminated, following the same tactical approach used against Taranis.  

Vox Galactica’s [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] reported: 

“Two of the eight Thargoid Titans have now been put out of action. Leigong suffered the same fate as Taranis, with its core being targeted by a sustained bombardment.” 

“Aegis is overjoyed at these results. Both Professor Palin and [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] are being praised for their development of the Guardian nanite torpedo, which is crucial to these attacks. And word is spreading that the Thargoid war machine has suffered a critical defeat, one that may change the entire conflict. Can these victories be repeated a further six times?”
