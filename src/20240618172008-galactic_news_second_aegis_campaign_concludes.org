* Galactic News: Second Aegis Campaign Concludes

/06 Oct 3303/

A spokesperson for Aegis has announced that its appeal for Thargoid-related materials has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver material to Chelbin Service Station, which will be used to develop new anti-Thargoid technologies. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Aden Tanner released the following statement: 

“Those who supported this initiative have my gratitude. With each new discovery, humanity becomes stronger. But we still have a long way to go.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Chelbin Service Station in the Wolf 397 system.
