* 0683 Commander Salomé Hijacked In Cemiess
[[id:51a92498-ef1b-4fc3-9ad7-9e49fb947353][Cemiess]]  

On August 23rd 3302 articles published by the Imperial Citizen may
have inspired an act of violence in the Cemiess system over the
weekend. Commander Nodus Curious of the [[id:11216b9a-43a6-4242-9355-1c6227e48db8][Chapterhouse of Inquisition]]
reported a transmission from Commander [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salomé]] of the [[id:7b48eea2-ee5f-47f9-9e14-8f5e827766b4][Children of Raxxla]],
indicating that her ship had been attacked by unknown forces.

The Imperial Citizen had suggested that Commander Salomé is in fact
Senator Kahina Tijani Loren of the Prism system. The publication also
implied that she had engineered the events that led to her family's
death in order to position herself as heiress of the Loren family
dynasty.
