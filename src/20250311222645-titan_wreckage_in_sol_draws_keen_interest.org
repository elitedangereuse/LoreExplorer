* Titan Wreckage In Sol Draws Keen Interest

/29 Jan 3311/

The wreckage of [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] far above Earth has attracted thousands of ships over the past several weeks.

As extensively reported in December, a huge effort from the Federal
Navy, the [[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots’ Federation]] and other independent pilots brought down
the last remaining Thargoid Titan after it assaulted the Sol
system. Titan Cocijo’s destruction was confirmed on December
18th 3310.

An excerpt from an article by [[id:13e6a0fe-199c-403a-b589-d7570fdaedac][Jason Nygaard]] of the [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][Federal Times]] offered the following:

“Thousands of ships have descended on the carcass of Titan Cocijo now
that the caustic cloud left in the mothership’s wake has dissipated to
less hazardous levels. Some seek to claim a trophy of this military
victory, while others seek to gain knowledge of Thargoid
technology. Others still have been seen posing for selfies, using
external camera modules to take the perfect snapshot for [[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE]]
channels.”

“Federal authorities had sought to limit the number of visitors to the
site, citing military security and safety concerns. But with other
Titan wreckages similarly popular, adventurous pilots have mostly
ignored these protocols and there seems to be little appetite to
enforce them.”

A memorial beacon to remember those lost during the [[id:9a246121-0c2e-4f21-9877-ee333d6b0d6c][Second Thargoid
War]] and the [[id:b0eb6430-5359-4c32-8593-48a8d07f6d72][Battle of Sol]] has been deployed in the system.
