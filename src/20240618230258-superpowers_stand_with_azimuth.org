* Superpowers Stand with Azimuth

/22 Jun 3308/

The Alliance, Empire and Federation will continue collaborating with [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] and [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] on anti-xeno operations. 

Political journalist Conrad Sterling reviewed the latest developments for Vox Galactica: 

“We now know the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]]: Azimuth not only survived, but was responsible for many controversial activities. It contributed to the [[id:0ffe3814-d246-41f3-8f82-4bb9ca062dea][mycoid]] virus’s development, coordinated with [[id:42b6a882-f396-4017-87de-9080d6291940][Black Flight]] and oversaw Project Seraph. Now, this notorious organisation enjoys the trust of all three superpowers to eliminate the Thargoid threat.” 

“Vocal members of the Assembly, Congress and Senate have called for everyone at [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] – formerly Taurus Mining Ventures – to be arrested as criminals. Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] has demanded justice for the crew of the Alexandria, which was sabotaged by Azimuth to obtain its cargo of Guardian artefacts.” 

“But Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders have all deferred to their militaries to determine a course of action until the current war’s end. Their perspective can be summed up by Admiral Maxton Price’s comment: ‘Without [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s superweapon, we will be locked in conflict with the Thargoids forever.’” 

“Many still claim that the INRA outpost at DG Canum Venaticorum was faked by Aegis loyalists. Others noted that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] did not confirm that he is Caleb Wycherley, and is potentially a far younger man building upon his predecessor’s research.” 

“The reality is that the momentum of [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s campaign is now too strong to be diverted. As is often the case during wartime, legality and morality have been set aside to focus on achieving victory. Azimuth has done more than just survive: it has triumphed.”
