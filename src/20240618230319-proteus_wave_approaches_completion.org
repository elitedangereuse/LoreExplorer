* Proteus Wave Approaches Completion

/21 Jul 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

New Federal and Imperial capital ships have arrived in HIP 22460 as Azimuth Biotech’s operation nears its conclusion. 

The following message was provided to all newsfeeds for public broadcast: 

“This is Salvation. The Proteus Wave’s core mechanism will be fully constructed one week from today. We will then begin integration with the surface site on HIP 22460 10b, using designs of mine which are unique to the superweapon’s operation.” 

“As anticipated, the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] presence in the HIP 22460 system has escalated considerably. Providing the sufficient majority of their fleet is within range of the Proteus Wave, the casualties will be devastating enough to drive the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] out of the core systems forever.” 

“I urge all superpower-affiliated and independent ships to hold the line. Only through determination and sacrifice will we finish our crucial work.” 

In HIP 22460, the Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have each deployed additional capital ships as the conflict has grown in scale and ferocity. These huge vessels are directing large-scale firepower against the Thargoids. 

Independent pilots are also being incentivised to destroy the alien vessels, with opportunities to obtain Salvation’s pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannons. [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] combat bonds can be redeemed at the Musashi in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system. 

Azimuth Biotech’s campaign for Guardian artefacts, which form the most vital components of the Proteus Wave, is now in its final phase. Deliveries can be made to the Bright Sentinel megaship in HIP 22460 until Tuesday the 26th of July.
