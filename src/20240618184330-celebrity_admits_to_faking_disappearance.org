* Celebrity Admits to Faking Disappearance

/02 Feb 3305/

The actor Consuela Knight, who recently vanished from her private yacht along with its crew, has been located at a luxury retreat. 

An anonymous reporter told independent newsfeed The Sovereign: 

“Consuela Knight was spotted alive and well at the Skyglow Havens on the [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] Archipelago, where she had been living under a false identity.” 

“When challenged, Ms Knight admitted that her disappearance was in fact an elaborate hoax. Fearing that her career was fading, she arranged her ‘mysterious’ disappearance to enhance her fame, paying her crew enormous sums to follow suit.” 

“Ms Knight has now fled [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] and is presumably living in seclusion elsewhere.” 

Many of Knight’s fans have disputed this account, claiming that such elaborate deception is out of character for the actor. Authorities have accepted the explanation, however, and the investigation has been officially closed.
