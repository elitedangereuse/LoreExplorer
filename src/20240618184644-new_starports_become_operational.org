* New Starports Become Operational

/01 Oct 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders* 

New starports constructed in ten systems causing increased commodity demand. 

Several refinery outposts have now been upgraded to starports, following an initiative to improve access to large ships for refuelling fleet carriers. 

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd has completed construction of the following Orbis starports: 

Harper Plant in the Fjorgyn system 

Iqbal Hub in the HR 4979 system 

Stephenson Dock in the Wolf 294 system 

McQuarrie Landing in the Lambda-2 Tucanae system 

Hartsfield Plant in the Potriti system 

The following Coriolis starports have been constructed by Steel Castle Inc: 

Rorschach Hub in the LHS 4058 system 

Chargaff Installation in the Chakpa system 

Nagata Vision in the Gally Bese system 

Reilly Plant in the Eta Cephei system 

Trevithick Vision in the Ninabin system 

As a result of the community drives to build these starports, there have been fluctuations on the trading market. The availability of several commodities has been reduced, resulting in increased prices and profit margins. The items affected include: 

Bauxite 

Building fabricators 

Gallite 

Power generators 

Rutile 

Thermal cooling units
