Herschel and Oberon reached the system then designated L-453
in 2412. [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] has been a Dictatorship from before the fall of the
Galactic Cooperative. In 3174, Dr. [[id:0b41fd3c-7d4e-4f61-b375-c96b99990d01][Hans Walden]] came to power.

Walden established an authoritarian Dictatorship. The previous
economic hardship brought about by the fall of the Galactic
Cooperative were still remembered. Under Walden there was stability,

Walden's rule was very long, and rumoured to involve genetic
manipulation as he greatly extended his own life, with his eventual
death at the hands of an [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassin]] triggering a revolution.
