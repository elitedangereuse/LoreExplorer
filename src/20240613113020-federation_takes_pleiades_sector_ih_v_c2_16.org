[[id:5339ace6-60ea-4cd9-915c-d75216e03b25][Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16]]

On August 18th 3302 the [[id:268dd81e-54f9-447a-9a47-11b2f7242e81][Pleiades Resource Enterprise]] confirmed that
the Federation took control of the [[id:5fcd46ca-b9bc-4135-8596-79ac2f8883f5][Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16]] system,
having ousted the incumbent [[id:c09feece-7689-4caa-bb83-dbde4757f6b0][Imperial Inquisition]]. In a statement, a
spokesperson for the organization thanked the many Federal pilots who
took part in the operation.

"This victory brings with it the promise of a brighter tomorrow - a
brighter tomorrow for the people of IH-V C2-16, who are now free from
the dehumanising influence of the Empire, and a brighter tomorrow for
the Federation, which has gained a valuable strategic asset."
