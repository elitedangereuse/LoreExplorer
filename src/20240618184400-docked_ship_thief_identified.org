* Docked Ship Thief Identified

/03 May 3305/

The individual responsible for stealing a docked Diamondback Explorer in the [[id:12db1b22-8d5c-482f-a91b-00021258a388][Vega]] system has been identified. 

Fort Dixon Security Chief, Misaki Sanders, told the media: 

“We have determined that Commander Bjorn Lennox’s vessel was stolen by a starship technician, who evidently acted alone without backup.” 

“The technician, Gan Romero, has worked at Fort Dixon as a member of the hanger service teams for the past eleven years. He has a stable home life on the station with a wife and three children, with no criminal record.” 

“Although Romero’s job gave him access to landing pads, it does not explain his ability to bypass ship security protocols or launch without authorisation. We have yet to determine his motive or destination.” 

“The scope of our investigation is widening and we hope to know more soon.”
