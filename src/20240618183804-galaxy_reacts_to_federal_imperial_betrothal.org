* Galaxy Reacts to Federal-Imperial Betrothal

/28 Jun 3304/

There has been a range of reactions to news that Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] and Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester are to be married. 

A congratulatory message was sent from the Imperial Palace, but there has been no personal comment from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. News agencies on Capitol have reported rumours that the proposed marriage was not discussed with the Imperial family, and that the Emperor did not consent to the Princess’s engagement. 

Senator Zemina Torval offered a more definite statement of disapproval: 

“This is an attention-seeking move from the princess, and a dangerous one. It is beyond her remit to impact Imperial policy in this manner. Allowing her to harbour romantic fantasies is one thing, but the Empire cannot countenance such a reckless political manoeuvre.” 

Senator Caspian Leopold, who until recently was rumoured to be courting Aisling Duval, was more supportive: 

“I can assure you that many senators, patrons and citizens are delighted by the news. I’ve been privileged to witness Princess Aisling in Ambassador Rochester’s company, and they make a charming and affectionate couple. I wish them both all the happiness in the galaxy.” 

There was no response from President Zachary Hudson, suggesting that the engagement was as unexpected to the Federation as to the Empire. But a statement was made by Congressman Isolde Rochester, the mother of Jordan Rochester: 

“I support my son’s relationship with Her Imperial Highness, and I consider this a positive step for all parties. The potential benefits of stronger ties between the Empire and the Federation are incalculable, particularly in the areas of trade and defence. Many of us in Congress hope that this happy event spearheads a new era of cooperation.” 

Reactions from independent systems have ranged from joy to outrage. The only official response from the Alliance came from a spokesperson for the office of Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, who said: 

“The Alliance offers cordial congratulations to the couple, although it remains to be seen if their intentions become a reality.”
