* Thargoid War Bulletin: The Last Mothership

/25 Oct 3310/

[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:22305812-c2e5-4d3a-9c1b-587a59d71f10][Raijin]] in the [[id:1f1fbdd0-0713-4d2d-9fe3-ae06c9066378][Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3]] system has been destroyed, leaving only [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] still operational. 

[[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], [[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][anti-xeno]] strategist for [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]], provided a brief statement: 

“My heart still soars to hear that another [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] has been taken
down. Until very recently, these colossal constructs were seen as
indestructible. [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] was even drawing up long-term strategies based
around them being permanently present in human space. The [[id:27942f92-70db-4108-9e2c-8200214355ed][Guardian
nanite torpedo]], and the hard work of so many pilots, has made that
academic.”

“[[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][Anti-xeno]] pilots are already travelling to the systems surrounding
[[id:32ec7520-f039-43f6-b66b-ed6f57ec9b89][Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18]], to repeat the process one last time on
[[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Titan Cocijo]]. With such a concentrated effort, it is not expected to
last long. However, I must repeat my earlier call for caution and
preparedness. We cannot tell how the Thargoids will respond to the
loss of their last [[id:71587a46-e5ac-4956-a7f0-7160cb032198][mothership]], and we may face unknown [[id:32267587-a5db-456f-8a09-439ed0309638][weaponry]] or
tactics.”
