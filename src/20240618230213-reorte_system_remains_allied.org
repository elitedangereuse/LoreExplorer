* [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] System Remains Allied

/31 Mar 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Pro-Alliance League’s success over the Reorte Mining Coalition means the system will stay in the Alliance. 

A greater quantity of advanced medicines, skimmer components and building fabricators were delivered to the Trobairitz megaship than to the opposing faction. As a result, [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] will remain an Allied system. 

Pilots who contributed to the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Pro-Alliance League’s initiative can now collect their rewards at the Trobairitz, along with the additional pre-engineered heat sink modules provided by [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. 

Chief Administrator Louisa Leblanc proclaimed: 

“I am deeply grateful to all those who helped convince our people that [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]]’s future is more secure with the Alliance. We look forward to working alongside [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] on increasing defences against the Thargoids.” 

The [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition’s CEO Fergus Cassidy expressed his regret that their campaign to renounce membership of the Alliance failed to gather the necessary support. He thanked those who supported them, and confirmed that credit rewards for contributing pilots are now available at Davies High starport.
