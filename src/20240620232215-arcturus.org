Early life had just started to emerge on Discovery when the human
settlers arrived in 2304. This has now been replaced by an [[id:7fec1142-ab20-47e1-b746-36edee889cc3][Earth-like]]
ecosystem, adapted to live under the red light. Locals are generally
confident their star will remain a red giant forever.

The [[id:7b522fdc-1a41-4e6e-a153-5917cf1fab1c][501st Joint Arcturus Wing]] is a faction that wants to bring peace
to the Arcturus system and neighbouring systems. The 501st believe
that you should never attack the innocent, and frown down on pirates
and terrorists. They also believe that the only way to truly bring
peace is to enlighten the people. The people of the 501st have a
certain loyalty to their leaders, five dictators. Only one being
known, the rest hiding in the shadows. The only one known to the
public is [[id:0b19d539-a8c5-4800-aa08-c032948b659e][Victor Lexx Crowe]]. Oddly, though it is a dictatorship the
people of the 501st have many freedoms. The only notable thing they
outlawed being [[id:11c82a20-33a7-444f-977c-0ea2f666c25b][slavery]].
