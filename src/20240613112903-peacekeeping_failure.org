* 0190 Peacekeeping Failure
[[id:686a1ef0-80ad-48c0-b2b5-f2da43b333f1][Phekda]]

In 2876, after a period of economic instability and civil war between
its corporate colonists, the [[id:686a1ef0-80ad-48c0-b2b5-f2da43b333f1][Phekda]] system had descended into
chaos. The Federation under President [[id:510632ce-ce95-4274-92c3-d8982b5f37f2][Jeremy Tann]] launced an offensive
to take contril of it. For a period of twenty years, a military
governor was imposed and attempts were made to repatriate the system
under a new colonial charter, but when new elections drove Tann from
office at the end of his term and rebel insurrections began to take
their toll and later in 2897, the entire effort was abadoned.
