* Federal State of Emergency: Winters Declared Acting President

/26 May 3301/

At 15:00 hours universal galactic time on 26th May 3301, Secretary of State [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] assumed the role of Acting President of [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] in the wake of the disappearance of Spaceflight One. 

Speaking in an emergency broadcast to the nation, Acting President Winters had this to say: 

“It is with deep regret and some trepidation that I must come before you today to announce that contact with the President’s ship, Spaceflight One, has been lost.” 

“Two days ago, Navy Command received word that the President would be taking an unscheduled detour to Azaleach. Her reasons as to why remain classified.” 

“12 hours ago, following entry into hyperspace, Spaceflight One went dark. All attempts by the President’s security team to trace the vessel have met with failure.” 

“Squadrons have been scrambled in an attempt to find President Halsey and Vice President Naylor, and I have faith that the Navy will do everything they can to bring them home.”  

“That said, in order to maintain a clear chain of command during this time of crisis, I will be assuming the role of Acting President of [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] effective immediately. I hope I have your support, and I hope it will only have to be a temporary measure.”
