President’s Bodyguard Found Murdered 
 
The Federal Security Services today revealed that a member of the Presidential Protection Detail has been found dead in her home. 

“Agent Susan Monroe was killed in the early hours of this morning and there is evidence that her residence had been searched. At this time we do not know why, or if anything was taken. Her death was caused by several stab wounds to the chest and neck.” 

When asked whether there were any suspects in the case, the spokeswoman responded: 

“We don’t have a suspect at this stage and the investigation is progressing. We do want to speak with Elaine Boyd, who was romantically involved with Agent Monroe, and have identified her as a person of interest in the case. We urge her to contact us to help us with our investigation. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Elaine Boyd then they should inform us or their local law enforcement agency.” 

Elaine Boyd is a reporter with the Federal Times, which refused to comment when asked about the reporter.
