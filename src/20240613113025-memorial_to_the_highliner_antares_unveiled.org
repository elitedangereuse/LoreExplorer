* 0691 Memorial to the Highliner Antares Unveiled
[[id:56a590bf-081a-4483-b38f-0c6e3b30cd75][Luyten 205-128]]

On July 1st 3302 the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] unveiled a memorial to those
who lost their lives aboard the [[id:f6b3276c-304e-40ab-8dba-6ecfca7d6c5d][Highliner Antares]], which was [[id:c65c6053-6022-44e2-a1c7-ada136ecad65][destroyed]]
in 3251 during its maiden voyage. Using debris retrieved from the
ship, capricious talent [[id:161b988d-e56b-446e-93d2-e1ac17098a1f][Delvin Hoorgan]] has created a striking tribute
to the souls lost on the ships inaugural flight.

The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and
has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow
light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the
sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a
crescendo of brilliance before subsiding.

Delvin Hoorgan waived his usual commission to participate in the
project. When he unveiled the memorial, he stated he was proud to have
been involved in remembering the event.
