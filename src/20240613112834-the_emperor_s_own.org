* 0140 The Emperor's Own
[[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]]

The Emperor's willingness to use force was proven when in 2959, an
Imperial strike force invaded the Laedla system and overwhelmed [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the
Federation]] garrison on Mansfield on 'Lighting Thursday'. This was the
first recorded deployment of 'The Emperor's Own', an elite military
corps.
