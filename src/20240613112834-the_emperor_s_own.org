* 0140 The Emperor's Own
[[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]]

The Emperor's willingness to use force was proven when in 2959, an
Imperial strike force invaded the Laedla system and overwhelmed the
Federation garrison on Mansfield on 'Lighting Thursday'. This was the
first recorded deployment of 'The Emperor's Own', an elite military
corps.
