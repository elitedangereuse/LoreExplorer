* Kokoller Mining Initiative Concludes

/06 Jul 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A mining campaign organised by Kokoller Limited has drawn to a close, with the organisers declaring it a success. 

The Federal corporation requested deliveries of bertrandite, coltan and praseodymium to supply the Kokoller system’s refinery base, ostensibly to manufacture supplies for the Federal Navy’s anti-xeno war efforts.  

Spokesperson Paul Dyson provided a message to participants: 

“It is genuinely a pleasure to see so many pilots respond to our call for raw materials. Harvesting those asteroid belts is no easy task, but the performance has been remarkable. I can promise all those involved in the campaign that the profits raised from refining and distributing these resources will go to a very worthy cause. Those credits are in good hands.” 

Kokoller Limited has confirmed that all contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Utley Hub in the Kokoller system.
