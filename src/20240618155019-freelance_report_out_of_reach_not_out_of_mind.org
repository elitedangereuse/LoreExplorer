* Freelance Report: Out of Reach, Not Out of Mind

/02 Sep 3302/

Following recent reports of a possible alien wreck in the Pleiades, the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released further information about the Unknown Probe. 

Shortly after planetary data was found in the Probe's tight-beam transmission, a message was sent to the Canonn from a pilot by the name of Commander [[id:aeca0c9b-da0e-4290-881f-1ed0dd67c211][Wace]]. It read: "The headerless octal number - it is distance compared to Merope!" 

A list of data followed, obtained by monitoring the Unknown Probe in different systems. The octal number was shown to steadily decrease as Commander [[id:aeca0c9b-da0e-4290-881f-1ed0dd67c211][Wace]] neared the permit-locked Col 70 Sector. 

In an impressive display of field mathematics, Commander [[id:aeca0c9b-da0e-4290-881f-1ed0dd67c211][Wace]] pin-pointed the Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 system as the Probe's 'zero point'. Unfortunately, the Canonn is prevented from further investigation of the system by the permit lock of the Col 70 Sector.
