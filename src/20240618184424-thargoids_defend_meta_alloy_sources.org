* [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] Defend Meta-Alloy Sources

/25 Jul 3305/

The [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] have emerged in the Witch Head Nebula, just hours after human expansion efforts in the region began. Numerous attacks in the area indicate that [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] craft are aggressively defending the region’s barnacle sites. 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] of Aegis Research said in an update: 

“Representative factions of the Alliance, Empire and Federation have entered the Witch Head Nebula to begin colonisation efforts. A number of megaships and Ocellus starports arrived in the area on schedule, only to be met with hostile [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessels soon afterwards.” 

This development, coupled with increased [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] activity in the Pleiades Nebula, suggests that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] are intent on driving humanity out of regions containing barnacle sites. Tesreau was quick to repeat that securing access to a source of meta-alloys is of great importance to humanity. 

“All three superpowers are urgently requesting help to repel [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] forces from the Witch Head Nebula,” said Tesreau. “Without the galactic community’s support, these pioneer factions will be forced to retreat, and vital supplies of meta-alloys will be lost.”
