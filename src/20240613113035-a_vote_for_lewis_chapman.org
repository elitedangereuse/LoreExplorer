* 0702 A Vote for Lewis Chapman...
[[id:9cf1f79e-2474-4252-a9fd-c4420e942dc7][LP 339-7]]

It took just over a year for [[id:d20f91af-3196-4258-ad57-64c7c61e5ed9][Starship Enterprises]] to rise up and
become the most powerful corporation in LP 339-7. It was a long and
difficult journey. But during this time SE Corp had instigated several
successful ventures that benefited the system. The Galaxy Tours
sightseeing company was bringing in droves of new tourists into 339
while SE Corps private security sector was working hard to quell the
vital trading lanes. Whitson had begun a humanitarian aid program to
help supply local factions experiencing famine. It was ventures like
these that eventually won the hearts and minds of the people of 339
and so when [[id:246ac86d-4a96-4fdc-907d-d8a84b142e70][Dr. Chapman]] announced his desire to run in the local
elections, it attracted unprecedented media coverage. A clever
campaigning team aboard a requisitioned Beluga Liner set forth to get
those votes into the SE ballot boxes and after four tiring days,
Starship Enterprises took the system, and So-Yeon as their
prize. Dr. Chapman quickly moved his agricultural trading framework
over to So-Yeon so that it could take over the mantle of main trading
post while Whitson orbital focused on science, exploration and
tourism.
