It took just over a year for Starship Enterprises to rise up and become the most powerful corporation in LP 339-7. It was a long and difficult journey. But during this time SE Corp had instigated several successful ventures that benefited the system. The Galaxy Tours sightseeing company was bringing in droves of new tourists into 339 while SE Corps private security sector was working hard to quell the vital trading lanes. Whitson had begun a humanitarian aid program to help supply local factions experiencing famine. It was ventures like these that eventually won the hearts and minds of the people of 339 and so when Dr. Chapman announced his desire to run in the local elections, it attracted unprecedented media coverage. A clever campaigning team aboard a requisitioned Beluga Liner set forth to get those votes into the SE ballot boxes and after four tiring days, Starship Enterprises took the system, and So-Yeon as their prize. Dr. Chapman quickly moved his agricultural trading framework over to So-Yeon so that it could take over the mantle of main trading post while Whitson orbital focused on science, exploration and tourism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
