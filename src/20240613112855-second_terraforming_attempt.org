* 0176 Second Terraforming Attempt
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]

In 2291, the second attempt to terraform [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] was eventually
successful. The techniques employed were crude by later standards and
the project had taken nearly a hundred years, but finally, humans
could walk on the surface and breathe without the need for oxygen
suits or respirators.
