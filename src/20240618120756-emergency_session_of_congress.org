* Emergency Session of Congress

/28 May 3301/

Shadow President Hudson today called an Emergency Session of Congress to address concerns surrounding Starship One’s disappearance. 

During the meeting, the Shadow President openly mocked the idea that Starship One’s disappearance could have been caused by simple engine failure. 

“Jasmina and I weren’t close – heck, we hated each other, and that’s the truth of it. But the idea, the very notion, that our best and brightest out there on Starship One would have let that bird fly with a busted engine... No way. Those guys are military. We need to be looking for who did it. We need to nail them NOW. The assassin is busy covering their tracks while we speak. This dithering inaction and woolly thinking is typical of this administration. Let’s face it Halsey had enough enemies like those onionhead guys, numerous frontier systems she has annoyed, and the elephant in the room – the Empire.” 

Acting President Winters took a more levelled approach. 

“I appreciate the sheer gamut of emotions my esteemed colleague must be feeling, but at times like these, level heads must prevail. We have found no evidence of foul play as yet.  Our engineers are sifting through copious amounts of data and so far it does look like a very unusual catastrophic failure rather than sabotage.”
