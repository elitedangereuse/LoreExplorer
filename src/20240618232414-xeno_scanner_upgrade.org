* Xeno Scanner Upgrade

/27 Jan 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

An improved xeno scanner has been released to assist combat vessels engaged in anti-xeno operations. 

Following increased calls from AX pilots that the existing xeno scanner’s limited range was a hindrance, Professor Palin’s team at [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] Laboratory delivered a redesign to manufacturers that extends the scanner’s upper range to two kilometres.  

Industrial complexes have worked overtime to distribute the latest model of xeno scanner. It is now available from military, high-tech and industrial planetary bases, as well as rescue megaships.
