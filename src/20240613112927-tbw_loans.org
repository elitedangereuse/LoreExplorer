In 3300, [[id:e23bc9b2-02ae-4efe-af70-378973602cdf][TBW Investments]] provides loans and saving oppurtunities for
individuals and businesses. It specialises in clients that prefer
their assets to remain 'off the grid'. The rates of return are good
and the vaults remain secure. They also specialise in the storage of
high value items, in private, individual strongboxes, stored in deep
underground vaults. Many suspect much of these contents are illegal,
ans simply 'cooling off' - though of course the bank would strongly
contest that.

TBW also trade in precious stones, both on behalf of clients, and
running private markets around human space, but particularly withtin
the Federation. They are well known as the best gemstone traders in
human space.

TBW maintain their own security fleet. These are mostly fast, and
well-equipped, using Fer de Lance craft mostly as comfortable
executive transports, carrying small cargoes very securely with
perhaps one or two clients only.
