#+begin_quote
The Alioth system is notable as the home of the
Alliance, one of the galaxy's three superpowers.
The system was the focus of conflict between the
Federation and the Empire in the 3200s due to
its tremendous mineral wealth, but the expulsion
of Federal and Imperial forces by Alioth's
indigenous population led to the creation of the
Alliance in 3230. The [[id:b2b2d9ee-9c33-4a0b-b3ce-82cfa362577e][permit]] for this system can
be obtained from the Alioth Independents.
