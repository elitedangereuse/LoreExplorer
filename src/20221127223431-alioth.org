* Description
Alioth, also known as Epsilon Ursae Majoris, is the capital system of
[[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]]. It is located in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion
Spur. Access to Alioth is restricted, and the permit can only be
obtained by becoming Allied with the [[id:d17b2062-68b1-43ea-8852-ab04b591c6ba][Alioth Independents]] minor faction
in any system where it has a presence.

* 0113 Alliance Assembly                                :beacon:EliteHistory:
The Alliance Assembly is the central body for the Alliance as a
whole. While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the
21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. In
main it functions as a means for establishing common policies and
treaties rather than laws. / It also acts as an arbitration body
between member states and depending on Assembly votes can enforce
sanctions or corrective measures. However the politics of the member
states often makes this a tricky process.

* 0114 Alliance Defence Force                           :beacon:EliteHistory:
Barring the small Alliance Defence Force for defending key components
of the Alliance bureaucracy there is no central Alliance Navy to
compare with the other major powers. Instead a headquarters
organisation exists staffed by the Council of Admirals and their
support staff. / The Alliance Defence Force is essentially a small
rapid deployment force made up of ships from the member navies, and is
maintained under the command of the Council of Admirals to respond to
any crisis - humanitarian and military. / In an emergency additional
forces would be provided by member navies if the Council of Admirals
makes an emergency appeal to the Assembly.

* 0115 Alioth History                                   :beacon:EliteHistory:
After the war between Achenar and the Federation concluded in 2380,
the Federation looked to find new resources elsewhere. In 2398, the
first of a new wave of colonial missions was sent to the outermost
sectors in the opposite direction to the Empire and Lave. / Alioth was
colonised in 2452. Survey data and reports had already indicated the
rich resources of the system before settlement, but the resources
proved richer than expected. / The first colonial settlement in the
system was known as 'Fruitcake', the name given owing to the loamy
consistency of the planetary surface and its propensity for small
mineral deposits.

* 0116 Alliance Council Members                         :beacon:EliteHistory:
Each Alliance Member State has a number of Council Members within the
Alliance Assembly, based on the size of their respective
populations. Some only have one. The Prime Minister is elected by the
Members, and it is his or her job to corral them into some sort of
consensus; generally a slow process. There is much less tradition than
in the other powers, and processes within the Alliance Assembly are
still subject to change - generally when arguments break out, as they
frequently do. In practice the Alliance is largely run by Civil
Servants - salaried officials that look after day to day running of
the Alliance, generally not getting involved in the political
struggles. / The Alliance Defence Force is run by the six member
Council of Admirals, independently from the Council of Members, but
reporting to it after the event, to facilitate rapid
decision-making. Each of the Admirals is from a key contributing Navy.

* 0117 Everichon Hijack                                 :beacon:EliteHistory:
In 2559, the tourist liner Everichon, full of Imperial nobles, was
hijacked by a [[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Caker]] group who planned to crash it into one of the gas
giants. The attempt was thwarted by Imperial commandoes. The holo-vid
broadcast and subsequent fictional dramatisation 'Rebel Madness', went
some way to diverting popular opinion from the insurrection.

* 0118 Tom Quaterson Death                              :beacon:EliteHistory:
Having smuggled weapons into the system, the tension between the
Cakers and the authorities was always going to spill over
eventually. In 2617, the death of [[id:63533857-27f5-474b-9885-ade924f8877a][Tom Quaterson]], a munitions worker
who had been convicted of selling food coupons to the poor, was the
spark that lit the flame of revolt. Workers on the gas platforms
seized control of the facilities and planetside, the general populace
stormed the Governor's residence. / [[id:3f4b114b-adf2-4150-8408-d86406848f0d][Quentin Deviseses]] wasn't just a
revolutionary. He had a long term strategy for the system and as soon
as the planet was secure, used every means he could to get the word
out that Alioth would become a free trade port. / The resource
implication of Alioth's independence was too much for either the
Empire or the Federation to take.

* 0119 Caker Coup                                       :beacon:EliteHistory:
In 2853, the science research outpost of [[id:fdf67e2f-4b6c-40ff-b1f8-9ccc8638b82f][Nesbitt Landing]] was
founded. Initially this was to be a joint venture between the [[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Empire]]
and [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]], but when a detailed study into the genetic problems on
[[id:47df3d18-6cdd-443d-baae-0e3af142a089][New California]] linked the issue with the terraforming of the planet in
2612, the Imperials withdrew from the project. / The matter remained a
local issue until, in 2854, responding to pressure from [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]],
Imperial soldiers instigated martial law and attempted to impose a
genetic correction programme on the planet. This was precented by a
[[id:0ce3c70c-e3ae-4a4b-8291-2db41b5058ac][coup]] against the military garrison by a new Caker sect. Within days,
the planet had been secured and an appreal was sent to the Federation
for assistance. / A fierce battle ensued; Imperial forces from the
orbital refineries began a planetary bombardment, but the arrival of a
Federal fleet escalated the conflict. Eventually, the Imperial ships
pulled back and [[id:6b6da1a6-087f-48c2-99b6-055141a3b6a1][Admiral Kracer]] landed with his marines to cheering
crowds in the capital. Kracer retired three years later, settling in
New California and later became the colony leader.

* 0120 Riley Dain Murder                                :beacon:EliteHistory:
In 3184, the election of Federation President [[id:691ec616-5efd-4f3c-bb2a-11db8b3901f9][Loric Trander]] saw a
renewal of hostilities over Alioth. This time, conflict was instigated
by corporate rivalry in the system's vast gas mining sector. After the
discovery of a murdered official named [[id:fa8094c2-7d96-448e-b4e2-a675e0214ef1][Riley Dain]] who was
investigating the abuse of permitted quotas, the situation quickly
escalated. Trander authorised a force off privateers. In response
[[id:8dc482e7-e978-4e6e-8a63-600e61cd715f][Hesketh Duval]] sent in the [[id:c7f194da-b6b0-4ba2-9d18-951da3a8bf7b][Imperial XV fleet]]. / The conflict avoided
the settlement of New California, owing to the previous treaty, but
the settlers there found themselves all but cut off until a further
ceasefire was established in 3198. Neither side achieved anything but
line the pockets of the industries who fuelled and powered their
fleets. It also served to stir further resentment amongst the
settlers. At this time, the [[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Caker]] insurrection became more organised
and received substantial financial support from unknown sources.

* 0121 Mic Turner History                               :beacon:EliteHistory:
Born in 3205, [[id:c46f5348-be85-4d06-bf04-12a9b812d0ad][Mic Turner]] grew up in [[id:cc0edb9e-01ea-4de0-85c3-74bb5b5196df][Jones Colony]] in the [[id:bb5887ea-0ed7-4410-9a7e-814107ea29eb][Essafa]]
system. After graduating with honours from the civilian Pilots school,
he moved to [[id:47df3d18-6cdd-443d-baae-0e3af142a089][New California]] in [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]], just before the rebellion
started. / In 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying New
California attempted to raise their prices again, the citizens
revolted, taking over the ships berthed in the space station and
riding out to the gas mining station to assault the corporate
workers. Federal and Imperial forces arrived within days, but fighters
from Alioth and several neighbouring independent systems joined forces
to repel them. / Turner's [[id:6a2dc1b0-f13c-4595-b844-8f79d5253a61][pilot]] skills saw him amongst the first to
fly out to the orbital platforms and he won a great deal of respect
from his peers for his efforts. It was here he met [[id:932c4921-da8d-4652-ab70-a19bdd49a8a3][Meredith Argent]], a
scientist who led one of the Caker cells on the gas platforms and was
direct descendant of [[id:c921a096-a8b0-4ebd-acce-c69bbd5ae4e8][Walter Argent]], a wealthy industrial from [[id:37a0d8e6-0c42-4e05-8d92-a4b75b89308b][Ayethi]]
in the the 27th century. Argent and Turner were to become partners for
life.

* 0135 Battlegroup's Disappearance                      :beacon:EliteHistory:
In 2924, a further conflict started up in the Alioth system, initiated
by a squabble over its hydrocarbon resources. [[id:a4742b9a-2519-400a-9e11-50710be11771][The Durn and Resner
Corporation]] applied for [[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Imperial]] assistance to enforce its claim over
a large swathe of the system's mining rights. A small force of
Imperial cruisers and their support ships arrived in the system and
rapidly deployed to enforce these claims. They vastly outnumbered the
mustered Federal units, and forced them out of the entire system
within a year. But then, without warning in 2925, the Imperial battle
group disappeared. Federal vessels returned and [[id:32d2f6e7-6a55-41ca-aa2c-8c3396eb0509][Hassoni-Kruger]]
appropriated the system's mining rights. Within months all assets of
the Durn and Resner Corporation were seized by the Emperor. The reason
for these strange events has never been discovered. Federal
intelligence sources were later to accuse the [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duvals]] of instigating a
[[id:4d2ace21-1658-4733-a922-e2fa97dfd3cd][cloning programme]] to breed specialised infantry units.
