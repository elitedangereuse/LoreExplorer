The Alioth system is notable as the home of the
[[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][Alliance]], one of the galaxy's three superpowers.
The system was the focus of conflict between the
[[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]] and the [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][Empire]] in the 3200s due to
its tremendous mineral wealth, but the expulsion
of Federal and Imperial forces by Alioth's
indigenous population led to the creation of the
Alliance in 3230. The [[id:b2b2d9ee-9c33-4a0b-b3ce-82cfa362577e][permit]] for this system can
be obtained from the Alioth Independents.
