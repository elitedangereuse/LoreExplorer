* Xenological Samples Delivered to Colonia

/14 Jan 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] has rewarded pilots who delivered
living matter extracted from space-dwelling organisms.

Many shipments of seed pod tissue samples arrived at [[id:935880a2-d4fb-4d27-ad48-0f95112ee0fe][Jaques Station]],
from where they will be transported to the Holloway Biology Centre on
[[id:d64c384b-5e85-44ef-ae31-a11e9577ce5f][Colonia 7 G]]. These will be used to replenish stocks used in the
facility’s experimentation programme.

Dr [[id:d5ca99a6-ded7-43fb-bc1e-83a622b49c50][Roy Casimir]], chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude: 

“These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the
incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway
we’re making many breakthroughs in the field of [[id:1e91dc52-399f-45a7-b139-1da18062f160][xenobiology]], some with
intriguing commercial possibilities.”

The [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] now plans to establish experimental
habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:

[[id:b50e4d30-4e47-4d98-93b5-284ac4914930][Eol Prou PC-K c9-154]]  

Pilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their
rewards from Jacques Station in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] system.
