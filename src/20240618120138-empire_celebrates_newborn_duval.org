* Empire Celebrates Newborn Duval

/02 Dec 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A new chapter in the Duval family’s history has begun with the birth of Hadrian Augustus Duval’s son. 

The announcement was made by The Imperial Herald: 

“Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Duval, has delivered a baby boy at an undisclosed secure location while under senatorial protection.” 

“The child has been named Hector Mordanticus Duval. This is in honour of Hadrian’s late father Hector Jansen, who was Emperor Hengist’s illegitimate son, as well as Imperator Kaeso Mordanticus, who played a major role in both Hadrian and Astrid’s lives.” 

“Despite Hadrian not being an official member of the Imperial Family, many citizens are jubilant at the arrival of a new Duval. The Imperial Palace, Princess Aisling Duval and Chancellor Anders Blaine have all sent messages of congratulation.” 

Praetor Leo Magnus, who was Hadrian Duval’s head of security, has resigned his temporary commission from ACT to assume leadership of Nova Paresa. The faction has organised an initiative to gather rare commodities for its former leader to celebrate the historic occasion. 

Pilots are asked to deliver Chateau De Aegaeon, HR 7221 Wheat, Indi Bourbon and Yaso Kondi Leaf to Dyson City in the Paresa system. All shipments will be subject to security scanning before being redirected to a suitable location.
