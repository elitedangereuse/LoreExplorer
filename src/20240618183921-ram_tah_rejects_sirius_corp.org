* [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] Rejects [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp

/02 Nov 3304/

The engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] has rejected an offer from the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation to support the manufacture of Guardian-human technology. 

In a public statement, he said: 

“These technologies, developed using principles discovered by the Guardians, are too important to become corporate products. I have no doubt that [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] would aim for maximum profits, rather than using the knowledge to aid humanity.” 

“Using tech brokers to distribute the designs allows them to be widely available, and thanks to the generosity of Aegis, the tech brokers’ costs have been reduced, making Guardian-human fighters and systems more affordable.” 

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation, has stated that his offer remains open, and that he hopes [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] will have a change of heart.
