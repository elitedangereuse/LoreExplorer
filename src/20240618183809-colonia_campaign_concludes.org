* Colonia Campaign Concludes

/06 Jul 3304/

The campaign to supply a scientific project in Colonia has now concluded and construction of a resource management centre has begun. Hundreds of independent pilots made the journey to deliver commodities to Tir Technology Services in the Tir system. 

Professor Alexei de la Vega, in charge of the research project, made this statement: 

“With the construction of a research centre we will be able to monitor population spikes and manage resource allocation throughout the region.” 

Pilots who contributed to the project can now collect their rewards from Bolden’s Enterprise in the Tir system.
