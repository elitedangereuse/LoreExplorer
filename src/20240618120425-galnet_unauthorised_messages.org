* GalNet: Unauthorised Messages

/21 Dec 3307/

*Pilotsâ€™ Federation ALERT* 

The editorial team at GalNet would like to apologise for the recent articles originating from an unofficial source. 

On the 17th, 18th and 19th of December, our publication network transmitted text messages of unknown origin. These articles were not officially commissioned or approved, and should not have been available via GalNet channels. 

GalNet formally apologises to all Commanders for this unprecedented disruption to our regular service.  

As yet we have no explanation as to how these illicit transmissions were inserted into our regular feeds. Our technical teams are currently investigating, and we are confident that this situation will not reoccur.
