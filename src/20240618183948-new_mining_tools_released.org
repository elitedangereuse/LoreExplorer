* New Mining Tools Released

/20 Dec 3304/

A range of new asteroid-mining equipment is expected to trigger an increase in the availability of ores and minerals. 

A spokesperson for the Industrial Mining Guild discussed the new tools at an industry symposium: 

“Using mining lasers to remove surface deposits from asteroids can be difficult. The new abrasion blaster fires projectiles that break them free more easily.” 

“For deeper deposits, sub-surface displacement missiles can penetrate the rock and then be detonated remotely, releasing larger chunks of material.” 

“Finally, there is now a way to access valuable resources deep within certain rare bodies. Seismic charges, when carefully positioned, can crack an asteroid open and free the minerals at its core.” 

“Combined with upgrades to existing tools, such as scanners and prospector limpets, we are confident that these new tools will result in a surge in private mining activity.”
