* Conflict in Geras Ends

/08 Nov 3304/

Authorities in the Geras system have confirmed that the conflict between Geras First and Ndozins State Inc has come to an end. 

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but in the end there could be only one victor. 

Independent journalist Donal Varden offered an analysis: 

“After a week of furious fighting, the Geras system is now eerily quiet. Ultimately only one side could be victorious, but this uneasy peace has come at a great and dreadful cost.” 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Yurchikhin Port in the Geras system.
