[[id:d75a6c3f-5c3a-418b-b639-5e14b487f568][The Federal Intelligence Agency]] is a secretive organisation that looks
after Federal interests outside the Federation. It runs both espionage
and counter-espionage operations, and provides covert support for
Federal diplomats abroad, providing intelligence relating to foreign
operations in addition to protection. It has also been pro-active on
many occassions. It has been implicated in destabilising foreign
governments, and helping those w√≠th which the Federal Government is
sympathetic or when their causes are aligned. Its operations have gone
as far as providing arms and training directly to rebels,
assassinations, rigged elections, all done in a clandestine and
deniable way.

The FIA also follows up on major interstellar crimes within the
Federation, where the crome crosses outside Federal space. It is a
secretive organisation (paralleling the Imperial [[id:01980efc-1b06-4f55-bf18-fa6c7e56f1eb][IISS]]) specialising in
corruption and high level crime, and is considered not very
accountable.
