* Thargoid Titan Wreckage ‘Could Accelerate Multiple Scientific Fields’

/16 Oct 3310/

[[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] scientists have recently held a public forum to discuss ongoing research into the wreckage left behind by Thargoid [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titans]]. 

The [[id:d67165b5-38fc-44ff-a364-2da2b88c50f9][Xenological Science Symposium]] on [[id:7529938f-7163-48a0-a499-c264def34710][Procyon B 7]] discussed topics
including technological advances made since the start of the [[id:9a246121-0c2e-4f21-9877-ee333d6b0d6c][Second
Thargoid War]], their potential application to non-military industries,
and hypothetical future-tech in the event of victory against the
Thargoid invasion force.

Keynote speaker Professor [[id:3af8bb5f-63d0-4a98-b172-dcbcb70b5a4f][Shamus Madigan]], part of the Federal
delegation to the [[id:9fb9205b-86d2-4326-85db-8f907b2243eb][Aegis Initiative]], chose to discuss the Thargoid
[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] wreckage and potential advancements from the components thus far
recovered from them.

“Obviously, we’ve seen huge strides in human aerospace technology with
the [[id:bb129165-335b-4dc9-9cf0-ee6640728a92][SCO]] frame shift drive. [[id:6ebf2d4f-85a9-4251-82c9-406c9c06b5a1][Achilles Aerospace]] has delivered a
marvellous device which greatly amplifies the travel speeds of small
spacecraft within a star system.”

“But the reality is that the scientific community is exploring further
applications of this xeno material. For example, the [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titans]] design has
mastered thermodynamic efficiency. The exchange of energy to power
while distributing heat away from core components is so effective it
has essentially redrawn the map of our understanding.”

“If we can harness this efficiency into large-scale manufacturing,
say, it’ll offer so many opportunities. Industrial installations could
work harder and faster without compromising safety. Raw resources
processed into finished products at higher rates could reduce consumer
costs and increase accessibility.”

“It’s quite an exciting time for research, industry and corporations
of all sizes.”
