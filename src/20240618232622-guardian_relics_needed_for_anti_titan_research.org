* Guardian Relics Needed for Anti-Titan Research

/18 Jan 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] requires urgent deliveries of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics to the Meene system. 

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, made an announcement to launch the initiative: 

“Since the arrival of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Titans, we have developed several new modules to bypass their defences. But these motherships remain a constant presence in our space, continuing to unleash never-ending swarms of Thargoid vessels.” 

“A recent theory presented by [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] has the potential to change this situation. Although details of his research remain classified for the moment, the theory is derived from the Thargoids’ inherent vulnerability to the technologies of their ancient enemy, the Guardians. Having witnessed Ram Tah’s laboratory tests only yesterday, I was hugely encouraged that his work could lead to the end of this devastating war.” 

“Aegis is doing everything it can to support this crucial initiative. We therefore request deliveries of Guardian relics, as well as the Unclassified relics that are created when these crystalline objects are inserted into an ancient [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] surface site. Quantities of both objects are needed to rapidly refine Ram Tah’s theory and develop prototypes. [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] has promised to reveal more details to the public should these prototypes succeed.” 

Aegis has asked that Guardian relics and Unclassified relics be delivered to Felice Dock in the Meene system, the site of Ram Tah’s workshop.
