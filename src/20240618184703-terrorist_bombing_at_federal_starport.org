* Terrorist Bombing at Federal Starport

/19 Nov 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Multiple explosions have struck Kepler Orbital in the Atropos system, causing huge damage and loss of life. 

Witnesses have observed signs of corrosion damage to the starport. This is characteristic of an explosive designed by the engineer Liz Ryder that deploys Thargoid caustic enzymes, and which was used in the bombings of Imperial starports in September. 

The NMLA has claimed responsibility for the attack. Its propaganda channels praised “the nine martyrs”, a reference to the terrorist suspects recently arrested by the Federal Security Service. There were also warnings of “further reprisals if the Federation impedes our cause”. 

The FSS has since confirmed that the captive NMLA members were being held in secure facilities at Kepler Orbital, which have been completely destroyed by the blasts. It is assumed that they were specifically targeted to prevent the prisoners revealing information about the paramilitary group under interrogation. 

Federal authorities are urgently requesting support from the galactic community, to assist with repair efforts and to rescue survivors still trapped at the damaged station.
