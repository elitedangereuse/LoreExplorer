* Thargoid Presence Persists in Multiple Systems

/21 Dec 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head nebulas continue to see an influx of Thargoid vessels. 

Freelance war correspondent [[id:9aac4d99-35c1-4f2e-91c1-b84cb73d54f8][Ernesto Rios]] reported for Vox Galactica: 

“Over the last few months, Thargoid ships have appeared in over two dozen populated systems including Shenve, Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5 and Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6.  All are in the vicinity of nebulas, which seem to be favoured by the Thargoids.” 

“In some systems, organised task forces of independent pilots have successfully hunted and destroyed the invaders. But in others, their efforts are undone by Thargoid reinforcements continually dropping out of hyperspace.” 

“There have been public demands to know why more superweapons have yet to be deployed. However, [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] has not responded to this. Some of his supporters believe that it takes time to stockpile the weapons’ resources, while others maintain that Salvation is focused on a masterplan to permanently eliminate the Thargoid threat.” 

“Until then, individual Commanders and anti-xeno squadrons remain fighting on the front line against the escalating Thargoid incursion.”
