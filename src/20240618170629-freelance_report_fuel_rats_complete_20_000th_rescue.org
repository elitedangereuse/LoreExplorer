* Freelance Report: Fuel Rats Complete 20,000th Rescue

/12 Jan 3303/

On the 7th of January 3303, the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] successfully completed their
20,000th rescue since their foundation in June 3301. The milestone was
reached during a busy weekend that saw the group complete a total of
230 rescues. Sources at Fuel Rats headquarters in the [[id:57a55cb2-8b28-4d81-88ed-80647ac33abf][Fuelum]] system
linked the spike in cases to curiosity surrounding reported sightings
of non-human spacecraft.

The [[id:78dc1804-9537-4e52-bba1-ca98efd86229][Fuel Rats Mischief]], an auxiliary wing of the Fuel Rats, revealed
that the 20,000th rescue took place in the [[id:7206bdfc-fe18-4783-8f16-e7860a2ce79e][Alrai Sector]], with
Commanders [[id:c979c111-67b3-4e54-88a8-f9739c0d4359][Esxste]], [[id:c56c76aa-f79d-43ca-a6ad-c8d0c6ba0901][FightingCookie]] and [[id:94ff588f-22e9-47bb-80b3-a11d4eed4546][Hillbillypolenta]] flying out to
rescue the stranded pilot. The group also paid tribute to Commander
[[id:e686de13-7ea0-4f75-b577-a7b67abe689d][Termite Altair]], who has completed an unprecedented 750 successful
rescues.

When asked about reports of [[id:860ffa72-12a1-44d6-bca5-d7c2cdc29a44][alien]] ships, a [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] spokesperson said
the group would remain true to its policy of neutrality and give fuel
to non-human vessels if requested.
