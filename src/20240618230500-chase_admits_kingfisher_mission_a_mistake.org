* Chase Admits Kingfisher Mission ‘A Mistake’

/06 Dec 3308/

Congressman Dalton Chase has made a public statement regretting his involvement with the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Advocacy Project. 

Chase became a member of Congress after an electoral campaign focusing on inter-species diplomatic relations. He was a key organiser and fundraiser for the Kingfisher megaship, which attempted to open communications with the Taranis entity but was subsequently destroyed with no survivors. 

In a press statement delivered from Olympus Village on Mars, Congressman Chase announced: 

“The tragic fate that befell the Kingfisher has affected me deeply. I now recognise that sourcing the means for those activists to intercept Taranis was, however well intentioned, a mistake. Such an endeavour should not have been attempted by inexperienced citizens, no matter their courage and tenacity.” 

“In honour of those brave people, I pledge to focus on proposals to introduce xeno-diplomacy as Federal policy. Rather than civilians needing to risk their lives, we should be bringing such operations to the Federal Navy at a congressional level.” 

Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has petitioned Congress to launch an investigation into Chase’s involvement with the xeno-peace movement. She described his role in the loss of over 3,000 lives as “beyond reckless”. 

Although the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Advocacy Project has faltered following the Kingfisher incident, some of its core members were recently involved in organising anti-authoritarian rallies. According to former spokesperson Timothy Culver:  

“The superpowers’ involvement in the massacre at HIP 22460, when they supported Salvation’s attempted xenocide, makes them responsible for the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] launching this counterstrike. We need to bring our leaders to account.”
