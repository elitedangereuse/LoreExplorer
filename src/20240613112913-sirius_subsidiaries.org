The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] has a great many subsidiaries, but its main
business centres around fusion reactors of all sorts - it makes and
sells hyperdrive fuels, hyperdrives, power plants large and small,
luxury surface transports, waste processing reactors, atmospheric
processing units, industrial facilities for smelting, refining, and a
wide range of mining equipment. It has cemented its position by using
standardised parts for its power plants - whether it is at the heart
of an industrial smelter, a luxury highliner or a surface city.

The Sirius Corporation now runs several dozen systems. These have a
stricht legal system, their own penal code (based on Federal law), and
their own law enforcement. They even have their own navy.
