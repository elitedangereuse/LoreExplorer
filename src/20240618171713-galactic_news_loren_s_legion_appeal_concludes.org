* Galactic News: Loren's Legion Appeal Concludes

/09 Mar 3303/

Ambassador [[id:47e03b47-2225-41ca-b331-af350e58572c][Cuthrick Delaney]], steward of the [[id:8da12af2-6006-4e7e-a45e-7bf8b2c299c8][Prism]] system, has
announced that the [[id:29fe7e20-3e8d-4285-aab4-52ce5ed11366][Loren's Legion]] appeal for tantalum has been
enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of
independent pilots responded to the appeal, resulting in a massive
influx of deliveries to [[id:8cff554e-5262-454f-8d3a-cfb2ea188b1d][Hiram's Anchorage]], the organisation's base of
operations.

In a statement, Delaney said:

"Loren's Legion would like to extend its gratitude to all the
Commanders who rallied to our call. Our immediate economic issues have
been addressed, thanks to your efforts."

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their
rewards from Hiram's Anchorage in the [[id:8da12af2-6006-4e7e-a45e-7bf8b2c299c8][Prism]] system.
