* Scriveners Clan Abandons the Hesperus

/09 Jul 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The dredger belonging to the Scriveners Clan has left the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, where the Hesperus megaship is located. 

The 200-year-old ‘ghost ship’, once owned by [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]], was discovered in April when the nomadic clan began salvaging it for materials and data. 

[[id:0367ce6a-a18b-4bca-a6d1-da93c2dd200f][Erik Gunnarson]] of the Wallglass Investigations Agency speculated: 

“When the Scriveners laid claim to the Hesperus, I expected only a cloud of fragments would remain. But their salvage operation has been prematurely abandoned, after stripping the megaship’s innards and leaving behind a mostly intact hull.” 

“Why have they done this? Perhaps because this particular dredger clan avoids outsiders. Public interest in the Hesperus inspired thousands of curious travellers to see it for themselves, potentially drawing more scrutiny than the secretive tribe could bear.” 

“Alternatively, the Scriveners detected richer pickings elsewhere – either fresh resources for the dredger to consume or new information for their ‘Knowledge Core’. In theory they could still be tracked down as their vessel’s hyperdrive has a similar range to modern-day fleet carriers.” 

“We know very little about the Scriveners, and even less about other clans. However, with the recent appearance of the [[id:327af983-8859-4d4d-9906-78d535ad621a][Blue Viper Club]] dredger at Kumo City, I’m hopeful more may be revealed about these roaming societies.”
