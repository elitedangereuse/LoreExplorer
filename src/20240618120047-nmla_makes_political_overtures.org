* NMLA Makes Political Overtures

/22 Jun 3307/

The Marlinism Reformation Party, which now represents the Neo-Marlinist fringe, has suggested a peace deal between the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] and the Empire. 

Minister Aaron Whyte explained the proposal during a session of the Marlinist Parliament: 

“Via anonymous intermediaries, we have received assurances that the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is keen to take advantage of our representation. I see this as a hugely positive step that will prevent further conflict.” 

“In essence, the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] is offering reparations for the unfortunate casualties of its anti-authority activities within the Empire. In return, it requests a permanent presence in the Imperial Senate as a means of continuing political dialogue.” 

Many other parliamentarians considered the proposal to be highly controversial. Minister Octavia Volkov declared: 

“Providing the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] with a political wing, pretending they are reasonable people, suggesting they could pay off the families of everyone they’ve murdered… Whyte, you are an insult not just to Marlinism but to all humanity!” 

First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for unity, insisting that the Marlinist Colonies must stand together to ensure their survival. However, she has officially requested that the Marlinism Reformation Party reverses its stance on negotiating with the NMLA.
