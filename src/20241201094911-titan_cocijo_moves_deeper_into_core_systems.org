* Titan Cocijo Moves Deeper into Core Systems

/28 Nov 3310/

The last remaining [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Thargoid Titan]], [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]], has unexpectedly left the [[id:32ec7520-f039-43f6-b66b-ed6f57ec9b89][Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18]] system. 

Reports from human [[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][AX]] forces fighting through surrounding systems to
expose the [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] say it has reverted to the [[id:4e6e17cb-3578-4347-a83f-2df27c50ff14][transient signal source]]
detected prior to the Titan’s arrival on the edges of human
space. Travelling at phenomenal speeds, [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] appears to be heading
further into the core systems.

A general alert has been raised in all populated systems. [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]],
special military advisor to [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]], gave the following statement via
all newsfeeds:

“[[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] sensors have confirmed that [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] is on a path deep into human
territory. Rather than seek to escape from the war, the final [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]]
intends to bring the fight to our heartlands.”

“Precautionary evacuation efforts have begun in [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]], based on our
earliest predictions of [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]’s trajectory. But all civilians must be
prepared to evacuate their homes at short notice. Our first priority
is to minimise casualties wherever it arrives – we saw the devastating
effect of a [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] beachhead in the first days of the invasion and must
do our best to avoid any repeat of this.”

Thargoid controlled systems appear to be completely empty, amid fears
that the remaining Thargoid fleet has set a course in pursuit of the
[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]]. AX defensive forces are scrambling to prepare for [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]’s
arrival, though Allied, Federal and Imperial fleet admirals have all
stated that a plan exists for this very scenario.

[[id:182c575c-e759-4f7e-ad38-cf8424926490][Rescue megaships]] are awaiting orders but are expected to move from
their current locations to aid in the predicted evacuation efforts.
