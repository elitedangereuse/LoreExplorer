Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] Issues Statement 
 
In the early hours of this morning, agents of the Imperial Guard and IISS arrested several members of Chancellor Anders Blaine's staff. He later released a statement: 

"It deeply pains me that members of my staff have brought such shame to my name and office. I regret to admit that Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]'s accusations are true, and that members of my staff have been instrumental, albeit without my knowledge, in conducting a campaign of slander against the Princess. 

"I take full responsibility for the actions of those in my employ, and offer my full and unconditional apologies to Princess Aisling." 

It is difficult to predict how this development will affect the succession vote. On the one hand, the Chancellor's link to Emperor's Dawn will inevitably damage his standing, despite his apparent ignorance of the connection. On the other, his contrition may go some way toward salvaging his reputation.
