* Pilots Form Vanguard Against [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Attacks

/18 Feb 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Commanders are resisting [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] incursions in the Dan, HIP 12314 and Nauni systems. 

Although Aegis support vessels have been repurposed to offer support in all three systems, the organisation remains officially disbanded. It has fallen to individual pilots to defend the populations from swarms of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessels. 

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy all intend to replace Aegis with their own anti-xeno taskforces, but these have yet to materialise. This was remarked upon by independent journalist Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse: 

“We’ve got the Alliance trying to sell its own people to Sirius Corporation, the Empire somehow misplacing its own Emperor, and the Federation being torn to pieces by its crazy president… who’s got time to worry about Thargoids? I’ll tell you who: the civilians in the systems they’re invading! Our so-called leaders are praying that Salvation will step in and save the day, but he could be an alien himself for all we know!” 

Commodore Morag Halloran, who serves as Salvation’s military coordinator, was approached by Vox Galactica to comment on his strategy for combating the latest [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] activity: 

“Salvation is currently focused on further development of the anti-xeno superweapon. At present this is the most efficient use of his time and resources, rather than small-scale engagement. Rest assured that, before long, we shall take the fight to the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] once more.”
