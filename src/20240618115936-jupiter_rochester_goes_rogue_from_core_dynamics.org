* [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] Goes Rogue from [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]]

/09 Feb 3307/

Several departments loyal to the [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] CEO have seceded to
form an independent corporate republic called [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]].

During the recent trial of Fleet [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]], [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]]
was named as the paymaster behind the sabotage of [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]]. This
hastened long-term plans to abscond from [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] along with many
ships and personnel.

In the permit-locked [[id:e1b0c446-0ced-475c-9031-a57e5e3c414f][HIP 54530]] system, the [[id:e1b0c446-0ced-475c-9031-a57e5e3c414f][HIP 54530]] Gold Universal
Group has been renamed as [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]]. It is assumed to have long
been infiltrated by [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Rochester]]’s loyalists.

Using the new self-appointed title of Supreme Executive Rochester, he
broadcast this statement across all Federal media channels:

“For many years, I helped [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] become one of the galaxy’s
strongest companies, but petty laws and bureaucracy restricted me at
every turn. I have always felt that people should not be ruled by
politicians, but by those holding true economic power – the
corporations.”

“It will be a long time before I can act on my commercial plans, but I
will prove that corporate rule is the most beneficial system of
governance for the Federation.”

[[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] is the eldest son of Shadow Vice President [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde
Rochester]], and a key member of the influential [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochester family]]. As
yet there have been no public statements from his mother or siblings.
