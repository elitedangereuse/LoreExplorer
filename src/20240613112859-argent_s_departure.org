* 0182 Argent's Departure
[[id:37a0d8e6-0c42-4e05-8d92-a4b75b89308b][Ayethi]]  

One notable power struggle in the Ayethi system was between the
Federal military and the Argent family, resulting in [[id:c921a096-a8b0-4ebd-acce-c69bbd5ae4e8][Walter Argent]]
leaving the system with as much of the family wealth as he could, and
re-settling his family in [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]].

[[id:fcf3d94e-5acb-473a-a89a-fed30e6e9d05][The Birthright Wars]] were often cited as a primary reason for former
member systems susequently leaving the Federation, and, much later,
the formation of the Independent Alliance.
