* System Colonisation Equipment Reaches Public Market

/26 Feb 3311/

[[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]]’s much-anticipated [[id:971c624f-bca8-4e23-b5bb-a57351cb1838][system colonisation module]] and
claim management process is now available.

While colonisation technology has existed for over a millennium, a
formal claim and colony establishment process for individuals,
communities and minor factions has not previously been
available. Analysts consider this a moment of historical significance,
as viable colony targets will not be dictated by large corporations or
superpower governments.

CEO [[id:0a249cc4-6f5d-4467-bf34-d6419b838581][Madelyn Teague]] shared her enthusiasm at a gala event in [[id:33b581d0-b31c-4177-9e70-9b478ad70e34][Minerva]],
covered by [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“The sheer potential of this process is staggering. I’m delighted that
the move towards widespread, community-led expansion was so eagerly
endorsed by all three superpowers. System colonisation contacts will
be available on starports to facilitate the initial work on a claimed
system.”

“This is an exciting time, and I can't wait to see how the next few
months unfold. Particularly when the latest additions to Brewer
Corporation’s Trailblazer fleet are finished next week. That
initiative is still ongoing at Starlace Station, by the way!”

Those looking to begin a new colony are advised to purchase and
prepare a suitable transport vessel, as considerable resources are
needed to establish a new port in a claimed system.
