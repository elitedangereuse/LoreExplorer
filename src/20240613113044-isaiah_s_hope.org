[[id:68f0a3c5-6a04-4c58-b203-367faee850cc][GCRV 4981]]

He loved to mine and to explore, sadly now that is a closed door.

We will see him well up in the stars, him leaving has caused some
scars.

We hope and we pray that one day there's a way, to see him again no
sadness, no grey.

As thoughts of him help us to cope, welcome CMDR to Isaiah's hope.
