The [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]] crisis had far reaching consequences for the [[id:f87b6e4e-09d8-4bea-a4cf-e1a44c468297][Federal
Council]]. [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]]'s leadership had been unquestioned, but the mother
planet was already undergoing a difficult period with the climate and
[[id:d9bd4ed4-2be0-4b30-a32d-83f85c925daa][radiation]] problems on Earth not improving, and yet [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] appearing ever
more verdant and a more confortable place to live, there was a general
exodus of the rich and influential. The prospect of [[id:1f37cad9-f017-4253-ae21-915fee1285a2][war]] with Achenar
required a strong hand. In time, the Federal Congress moved from
Washington on Earth, to [[id:bb96c46f-09d5-4e50-ac48-026557d18621][Olympus Village]] on Mars, and this helped ease
friction with other Federation members - as there was a consultation
period where other systems were considered.

Nevertheless, the next sixty years saw several fledgling colonies opt
out of their colonial charter obligations once they arrived on their
chosen world and accept the rulership of the [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duvals]]. The Emperor
played the politics skillfully. The massive natural resources being
offered and exported from Achenar countered the benefits of then
superior Federal technology, whilst the Duval emphasis on subjugating
[[id:860ffa72-12a1-44d6-bca5-d7c2cdc29a44][Alien]] ecology to the needs of the colonies, made them a popular
benefactor for struggling settlements.
