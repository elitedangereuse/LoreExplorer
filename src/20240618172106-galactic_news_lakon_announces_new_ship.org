* Galactic News: Lakon Announces New Ship

/17 Dec 3303/

The Alliance has commissioned Lakon Spaceways to produce a new ship in response to the recent Thargoid attacks in the Pleiades. The vessel, which has been named the Type-10 Defender, represents a comprehensive revision of the Type–9 Heavy. 

Lakon issued the following statement: 

“The Type-10 boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout. We envisage it being particularly effective in combat situations.” 

The development is significant in that it represents the first overtly military response from the Alliance to the rising Thargoid threat. 

Lakon has committed to an aggressive production schedule that should see the Type-10 reaching retailers next week.
