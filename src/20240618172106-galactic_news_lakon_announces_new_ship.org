* Galactic News: Lakon Announces New Ship

/17 Dec 3303/

The Alliance has commissioned Lakon Spaceways to produce a new ship in response to the recent [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] attacks in the Pleiades. The vessel, which has been named the Type-10 Defender, represents a comprehensive revision of the Type–9 Heavy. 

Lakon issued the following statement: 

“The Type-10 boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout. We envisage it being particularly effective in combat situations.” 

The development is significant in that it represents the first overtly military response from [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] to the rising [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] threat. 

Lakon has committed to an aggressive production schedule that should see the Type-10 reaching retailers next week.
