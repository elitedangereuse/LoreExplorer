* Galactic News: Imperial Ships to Enter Merope

/13 Jul 3302/

Following a recent statement from Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] in which the seasoned politician criticised the deployment of Federal battlecruisers in the Merope system, Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] has entered the debate. At a hastily organised press conference on Capitol, Admiral Patreus addressed the Federal intervention: 

"Like Senator Torval, I believe that the Federal presence in Merope represents an attempt to lay claim to the system's non-human structures. This will not stand. An Imperial deputation will therefore be mobilised and despatched to the Merope system. I will take personal command of the fleet, which will depart within the month." 

Patreus did not clarify whether the Imperial ships would engage the Federal fleet, or simply establish a counter-blockade. But one thing is for sure: this development can only serve to heighten tensions between [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and the Empire.
