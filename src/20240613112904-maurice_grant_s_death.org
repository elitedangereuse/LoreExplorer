* 0191 Maurice Grant's Death
[[id:d7fab9bb-976b-4012-a181-af389e9a2396][Ross 128]]

In 2905, the Federation answered a plea to restore order in
Ross 128. [[id:7770fe09-573e-41f0-a05c-e3cb38b682f6][Maurice Grant]], the would-be leader of the colony there, had
been [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassinated]] in 2903. A Federal task force took charge of the
colony and the rest of the system, then enforced a new colonial
charter on its citizens, re-classifying it as a penal and correction
facility.
