* Thargoid War Update: February 3309

/23 Feb 3309/

An overview of recent developments regarding the Thargoid conflict, as reported by [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] on the Vox Galactica newsfeed.  

“Over the last month, Thargoid fleets have continued expanding outwards from the eight Maelstroms. The front lines of the war are relentlessly encroaching deeper into the core systems, leaving desolation and death in their wake.” 

“A dedicated resistance force won a few precious victories, with 61 systems fully liberated from Thargoid control. But compared to the 634 systems that have been overrun, it would be optimistic to suggest the aliens’ advance is being significantly impeded at this stage.”  

“Fierce fighting has also broken out in the California and Witch Head Nebulas. It’s been speculated that the Thargoids seek to secure the barnacle sites seeded in those regions millennia ago… a reminder that this species may view all of our space as its original territory.” 

“Despite these grim developments, practical support arrived in the form of [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]]’s experimental weapons stabilisers and Professor Palin’s improved xeno scanner. Both were welcomed by independent pilots, increasing their chances of triumphing over the powerful Thargoid vessels.” 

“Of course, the biggest news is the resurrection of Aegis. Key figures in the Alliance, Empire and Federation managed to re-establish the anti-xeno agency that was once abandoned in favour of [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]. Already there are promises of technological breakthroughs, including the ability for ships to better withstand the caustic hell inside the Maelstroms.” 

“As our best and brightest work together in earnest, time will tell if they can prevent this war from overwhelming us all. This is [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”
