* Ram Tah Campaign Concludes

/16 Feb 3304/

Ram Tah has announced that the galactic community has responded positively to his appeal for Guardian artefacts, resulting in a large number of deliveries to Felice Dock. The engineer will now subject the artefacts to extensive analysis. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Ram Tah issued the following statement: 

“My heartfelt thanks go to all those who supported this initiative. I’ve already started work and I should have something to share with you soon.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.
