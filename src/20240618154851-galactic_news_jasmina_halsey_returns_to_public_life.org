* Galactic News: [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] Returns to Public Life

/29 Jul 3302/

At a recent charity event, former Federal president [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] made her first public appearance since she was discharged from a secure psychiatric facility on Mars two weeks ago. The woman seen at the event differed dramatically from the frail individual seen leaving the Clearwater Clinic. Some commented that she appeared even more confident than when she was in office. 

After the event, reporters asked President Halsey what she has planned for the future. 

"I know that many of you have been perplexed by my recent statements, but having reflected on my experiences, I have accepted that what I saw might not have been literally real. I do believe, however, that the message contained in those experiences is valid, and that I have a duty to share that message." 

"As a species we have learned nothing from our history. We plundered the Earth for its treasures, treating it with callous indifference, and now we stumble blindly into space in pursuit of wealth and glory. And all the while we are heedless of the damage we cause." 

"We remain a violent species, unable to cooperate, and we are therefore deprived of the prosperity that true peace would bring." 

Halsey further surprised reporters by stating that she had recently met with Alliance Prime Minster Edmund Mahon, and that she would soon be relocating to a system within Alliance space.
