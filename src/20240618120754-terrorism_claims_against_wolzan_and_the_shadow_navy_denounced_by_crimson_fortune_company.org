* Terrorism Claims Against Wolzan and the Shadow Navy Denounced by Crimson Fortune Company

/25 May 3301/

Ellie Blossum, The CEO of the Crimson Fortune Company, has today issued a statement regarding the recent unrest in [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]]. 

"As many of you know, the Federation’s influence in [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]] has come under attack in recent months, despite many years of peace between the Blossum and the Faveol families.” 

“We believe that this destabilisation effort was a deliberate act of malice, intended to encourage certain unruly members of the Faveol family to attempt to expand beyond the borders of [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]], as evidenced by the recent attack on Volungu.” 

“The Crimson Fortune Company would like to thank Commander Wolzan and the Shadow Navy for their efforts to keep the [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]] system in a fair balance of power. We would also like to thank the many Federal pilots who came to our aid during the blockade of Liaedin last weekend. Without your diligence, we are certain that enemies of the Federation would even now be using Liaedin as a staging area for their illegal expansionist agenda.”
