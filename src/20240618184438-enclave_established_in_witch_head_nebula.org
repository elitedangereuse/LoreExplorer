* Enclave Established in Witch Head Nebula

/31 Jul 3305/

Recent reports from the Witch Head Nebula indicate that the Thargoid forces in the region have been defeated. The initial call to arms from Aegis Research was met with an overwhelming response from independent pilots, who were able to push back Thargoid incursions from the new human colonies.  

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, said: 

“Humanity has achieved a decisive victory in the Witch Head Nebula. Significant numbers of Thargoid vessels were destroyed in the conflict, even as many independent pilots were lost. But the sacrifice of these brave souls was not in vain, for the enemy has been forced to withdraw.” 

“While the threat of occasional incursions from Thargoid craft remains, our colonial assets have been firmly established in the region.” 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] of Aegis Research looked to the future: 

“The Alliance, Empire and Federation have declared that the Witch Head Nebula is now an official enclave of humanity – a region that their joint efforts have enabled them to share equally.” 

“But the damage inflicted on our new starports must be repaired before we can harvest the barnacle sites in the area. Independent pilots have already given so much, and for that I am humbled and thankful. And yet, we must ask for one last favour: to support the repair of these starports.”
