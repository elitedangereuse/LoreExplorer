* 0163 Church of Kum-Byar
[[id:6935cefb-7739-4ac2-91a0-de4a984feae1][Arexack]]

The Church of [[id:d4d70ceb-ba90-4c61-8bc1-3228411a3760][Kum-Byar]] is a zealot faith in the [[id:6935cefb-7739-4ac2-91a0-de4a984feae1][Arexack]] system. A
civil war between two sects of the church raged for more than one
hundred years before an uneasy truce was called in 2361. The religious
values of the church are austerity and the removal of all body hair.
