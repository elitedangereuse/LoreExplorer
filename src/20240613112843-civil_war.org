* 0153 Civil War
[[id:35ef7825-95ca-418d-9cc2-9e7934b351c9][Tiliala]]

In 3251, civil war broke out in Tiliala. The Dictator and leader of
the [[id:20e3598d-8ae1-4a9a-a393-c97f0771796b][Valhallan Democratic Peace Party]], [[id:20664a03-893b-40d4-b9a6-790503708121][Augustus Checkin]], under threat
from the [[id:afe3edc3-ba12-465e-b39b-eef37d37a5a3][Valhallan Liberation Front]]. 'Friends' of the ruling party put
out a contract on the leader of the [[id:09c3bc7b-96af-42e7-9a8e-385209fd1638][Valhallan Liberation Army]] (the
armed wing of the VLF), [[id:79832d10-b5db-4944-a808-e5b2f11c2cb7][Dentara Rast]].

Over the next few months, the conflict gradually petered out, moving
towards a diplomatic solution until other members of the VLA were
assassinated. In response, [[id:79832d10-b5db-4944-a808-e5b2f11c2cb7][Dentara Rast]] took to the holo-vid channels
and swore revenge.

The chance discovery of [[id:d10c0435-4bc8-42ac-bea6-228d2f02604c][Tantalum]] (a rare and valuable metal) on the
planet drew Imperial interest to the situation. A covert force of
Imperial ships were detected by local police, who appealed for Federal
assistance and a battlegroup was despatched.
