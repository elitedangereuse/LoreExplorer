* The War for [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]]

/07 Mar 3301/

[[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Senator Patreus]] and the [[id:b3659f96-e6dd-4c6e-b860-f3be6b6bcef1][Citizens of Tradition]] have been successful in
their crusade against the [[id:187aedfb-f0ae-4d10-983c-c34d1122c842][Falisci Purple Gang]]. [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] has fallen to
Imperial forces and is currently in the process of being assimilated
into Imperial society.

All outstanding payments due to Imperial veterans of the [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] war
are now available for collection from [[id:da427714-a287-496d-a288-be79c5dbc360][Dornier Terminal]] in
[[id:36dc081e-5308-4677-978e-cd9eee894d1b][Ngaiawang]]. To celebrate Senator Patreus’s victory, [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Senator Torval]] is
offering a 10% discount on all Imperial slaves purchased from Dornier
Terminal until next weekend.

However, the war for control of [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] may not quite be over
yet. Reports have started to come in from the region that a civil war
is currently brewing between the Citizens of Tradition and the Federal
[[id:321ff0fa-0018-4a42-b219-9fb8dbcdf234][Social [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] Partnership Party]]. If the Social Falisci Partnership
Party is successful in its attempt to disrupt the Citizens of
Tradition’s hold over Phillips Landing, the Federation may be able to
gain control over [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]].
