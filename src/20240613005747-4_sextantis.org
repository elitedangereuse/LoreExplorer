Note: As per FDEV support on (referenced on [[https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/][page 57]], thanks CMDR
LeinhartKUF!), this system is deliberately unattainable. It is
possible to see the permit, but ranking up to allied with the 4
Sextantis faction that gives it makes the permit mission
disappear. Again this is not a bug, but FDEV's way of locking this
system for a future content release.
