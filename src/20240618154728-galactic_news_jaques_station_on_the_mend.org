* Galactic News: [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station on the Mend

/07 Jul 3302/

Only a week after an independent mission was launched to bring aid to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station, personnel at the starport have reported that limited repairs have been completed. A member of the station's technical team confirmed that meta-alloys had been used to partially restore the starport's commodities market, and went on to say: 

"We're hugely grateful to all the pilots who have so selflessly made the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. But we feel bad about not being able to reimburse those who schlepped out here, so we're trying to secure funds for a proper campaign to repair the starport. More details will follow soon." 

Meanwhile, reports have surfaced of an increasing number of independent pilots and civilian delegations departing for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, indicating a strong impulse to establish permanent bases in the region.
