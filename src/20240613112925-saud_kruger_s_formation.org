* 0226 Saud Kruger's Formation
[[id:4ee2a5f7-7b84-4261-aeb9-ebcddc41ad7c][Bedaho]]

The [[id:49b21fdc-6a96-42b3-a496-123e8106f102][Saud Kruger]] Corporation is relatively new on the corporate stage,
but built on much earlier foundations. It was a small, specialist
yacht manufacturer that had been very successful as a family business
in a small niche. [[id:39e42b99-ece9-4a2f-a859-858f2887e5f4][Stanislav Kruger]] took over the family firm from this
father in 3270.

A luxury ship manufacturer, and interstellar tourism business, the
[[id:1b328227-3a16-47d3-af61-df3592c4ddf5][Astrogator Corporation]] prided itself on delivering the most stylish of
holiday experiences. It claims the legendary explorer [[id:4cf8f542-dfcf-4d54-88ea-2f136e760a4a][Augustus Brenquith]] as its long dead patron and bought up all image rights to
the man's legacy several hundred years ago.

The Corporation was based in Bedaho, but maintains office facilities
in 80% of all colonised systems and through its contractual support
program, helps local tourist attractions develop their portfolio for
the discerning interstellar explorer.
