* Community Goal: Emperor's Dawn 'Shadow' Cells Discovered

/21 Jan 3302/

When the Federal Navy destroyed the Emperor's Dawn base in the Kausalya system in December, many believed the organisation had finally been defeated. The Federal offensive, which was supported by a large deputation from the Federal Navy Auxiliary, was swift and merciless, and resulted in the total destruction of the insurgent outpost. But a statement from the office of Imperial Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] indicates that, against all odds, Emperor's Dawn has endured. 

"The Imperial Internal Security Service has discovered that Emperor's Dawn has 'shadow' cells in the Dakshmandi, Ipilyaqa and Ch'i Lin systems â€“ secret outposts that were apparently designed to protect the organisation's leadership in the event of a military defeat. It is of course vital to the continued security of [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] and its people that these outposts be neutralised as swiftly as possible. If it is not, Emperor's Dawn could re-emerge to threaten the galaxy once again." 

Senator Patreus went on to issue a call to arms: 

"Swiftly neutralising these outposts depends on the support of the galactic community, and to this end I have authorised the payment of privateer bonds to any pilots who help with the offensive against Emperor's Dawn. Let us destroy these vile dissidents once and for all."
