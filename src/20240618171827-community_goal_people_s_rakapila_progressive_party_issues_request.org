* Community Goal: People’s Rakapila Progressive Party Issues Request

/30 Jun 3303/

Following a population spike in Rakapila, the People’s Rakapila Progressive Party has issued a request for commodities in order to stimulate the system’s economy. 

The organisation has placed an open order for domestic appliances, consumer technology and clothing, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering material to Stone Enterprise can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 29th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
