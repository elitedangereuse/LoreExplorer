* Galactic News: Exploration Data Appeals Conclude

/01 Dec 3302/

A spokesperson for The Children of Raxxla has announced that its appeal for exploration data has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community, which delivered large quantities of astronomical data to Sereborv Terminal over the past two weeks. A competing initiative from [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] proved less popular with the galactic community. 

In a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked those who had contributed to the initiative, and continued to say: 

"We know there are secrets buried in this data. We only hope we can unlock them in time." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Sereborv Terminal in the HR 6421 system.
