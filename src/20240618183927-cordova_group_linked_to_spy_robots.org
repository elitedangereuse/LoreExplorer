* Cordova Group Linked to Spy Robots

/15 Nov 3304/

The Federal Times has revealed a connection between the Cordova Group and the spy robots scandal. 

Chief Editor Lena Ravenhill wrote: 

“Ramesh Thorne’s recent appeal elicited a response from an anonymous whistle-blower – a robotics engineer employed by the Achilles Corporation who helped design the robots at the heart of these events.” 

“The engineer has attested that she was blackmailed by Kingsley Cordova, owner of the Mars Tribune, into installing surveillance programs on robots belonging to well-known people in the Sol system. The accumulated data was relayed to the Cordova Group, which published it in The Mars Tribune.” 

A spokesperson for the Achilles Corporation said: 

“The engineer has provided us with a ‘kill switch’ that remotely deletes the spy program she designed. This coreware update has now been transmitted to all PA912 model robots. We can therefore assure our customers that there is no longer any risk of their private information being misused.”
