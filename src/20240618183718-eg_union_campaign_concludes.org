* EG Union Campaign Concludes

/30 Mar 3304/

The EG Union has announced that its campaign to build a shipyard in CPC 20 6743 has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lyakhov Dock, and by eliminating agitators in Ross 720 and surrounding systems, thereby ensuring the safety of traders. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system.
