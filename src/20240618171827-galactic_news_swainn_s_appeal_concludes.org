Celebrated chef and bromatologist Dr Cordelius Swainn has announced that his appeal for rare goods has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] Station. 

Dr Swainn is said to be delighted with the variety of items delivered, and boasted that his forthcoming culinary event would be even more spectacular than planned.
