* Galactic News: Secret Billionaires’ Campaign Concludes

/13 Oct 3303/

The Secret Billionaires have announced that their campaign to clear the I Carinae system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Commander Ranger-One, a member of the Secret Billionaires, issued the following statement: 

“We would like to thank the galactic community for cleaning up our system. The people of I Carinae can now look forward to a period of peace and stability.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Somerset Station in the I Carinae system.
