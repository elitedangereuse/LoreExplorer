* 0668 Construction Convoy Assembled
[[id:bb8ac014-a3ac-4564-9c3a-7aaff6536d59][Zearla]]

On 18th November 3302 a large convoy of heavy construction ships and
associated support vessels was assembled by [[id:d83dcf95-2757-4708-8988-d48f2b345932][Wreaken Construction]] in
the [[id:bb8ac014-a3ac-4564-9c3a-7aaff6536d59][Zearla]] system.

Some commentators believed this was directly linked to Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton
Patreus]]'s recent comments concerning the [[id:75d80d23-d9c1-4a3a-81b7-2ddb22539fa1][London Treaty]].
