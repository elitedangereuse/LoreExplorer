Work on a new Ocellus starport began in the Kaushpoos system of the Pleiades Nebula on 28'th October 3301. Within a day, pirates began congregating in Kaushpoos, preying on traders and contractors travelling to and from the system. A request for aid was sent out and the pirates were repelled in short order. Later the starport was named Obsidian Orbital via public vote. / On 19th December it was reported that the new station had been affected ny technical issues plagueing the galaxy, but personnel were determined to keep it running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
