* Federation Battles Independents in the Azaladshu System

/01 Jul 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Conflict has erupted between the Azaladshu Free and Neche Inc factions, as multiple Federal systems declare independence. 

This was sparked by Azaladshu Free withdrawing from the Federation, which transformed Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 into independent systems. The faction strenuously opposes government monitoring of Federal citizens’ private communications. 

Three other Federal factions are on the verge of declaring independence: Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour. All are closely monitoring the situation in Azaladshu and considering their next move. 

Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, made this statement: 

“We refuse to accept the Federation’s draconian surveillance laws. I call upon all supporters of independence to help us fight for our sovereignty!” 

The declaration brought a swift reaction from President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]]: 

“As Azaladshu Free has violated the Federal Accord, I have no option but to order Neche Inc to engage with these criminals. Thanks to advance intelligence on the secession, we were able to establish the megaship Fortress Liberty in the system to help retake it for the Federation.” 

In Congress, Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] faced criticism for allowing the secession to occur within her sphere of influence. She reiterated that she does not support rebellion, but does consider the Proactive Detection Bureau to be unconstitutional.
