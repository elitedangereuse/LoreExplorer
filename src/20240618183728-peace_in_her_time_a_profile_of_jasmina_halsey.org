* Peace in Her Time: A Profile of Jasmina Halsey

/20 Apr 3304/

Independent journalist Chukwuma Grant has published an article on peace activist and former Federal President Jasmina Halsey. Grant has described the report as a wide-ranging analysis that addresses “the political impact of a politician renouncing politics”. 

Key extracts from the article are reprinted below: 

“Some believe that [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] always intended to defect from [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and join the Alliance, where she currently acts as an advisor to Prime Minister Edmund Mahon. Others assert that after years of inhumane politics, her conscience broke through – that she sought meaning by helping others and striving for concord between the powers.” 

“But it was Starship One’s destruction that transformed Halsey – something that she herself could not possibly have planned. Her subsequent ‘visions’ made her politically toxic, at least as far as [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] was concerned, allowing her to simply walk away from presidential life. In that escape pod, she escaped from more than an exploding ship – she escaped her previous self.” 

“Critics argue that Halsey’s extraordinary claims of encountering super-intelligent beings and seeing paradise are meaningless without evidence. And yet, in a cosmos containing [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] and Guardians, can they be easily dismissed? Or are her outlandish claims designed to cultivate a following among the disenfranchised and make her into a messianic figure?” 

“If Halsey is walking a deliberate path, it remains an unstable one. Many in [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] have questioned why their leader is taking advice from a former psychiatric patient, let alone an ex-Federal President. Whether she is a visionary, a lunatic or a brilliant political manipulator remains to be seen.”
