* Galactic News: Imperial Initiative Succeeds

/28 Apr 3303/

The [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] Expeditionary Fleet has announced that the Imperial campaign to amass material for a new outpost in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering construction materials to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system. 

As the campaign drew to a close, Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] released a brief statement, thanking those who supported the initiative. It is expected that work on the new outpost will begin imminently. 

Pilots who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system.
