* Galactic News: Curious Developments in Tionisla

/05 Aug 3302/

For the first time in over a hundred years, a new ship has been added to the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard. Established in the 3100s, the mausoleum was originally a resting place for the rich and famous, but in the economic slump that befell the Old Worlds during that period, the graveyard fell into disuse. 

With many of its relics vandalised or looted, it came as something of a surprise when the Tionisla government received a request to inter a recently deceased Commander. 

Despite the unusual circumstances, the government of Tionisla processed the application with surprising swiftness, prompting speculation that the individual may have been some kind of celebrity. 

Just before the vessel was moved to its final resting place, an onboard beacon briefly activated, transmitting a repeating sequence of curious characters. This continued for a few minutes until a power failure silenced it. The message read "OTSEAFOTSEAF". The significance of the transmission, if any, is unclear. 

"I wouldn't worry about it," said Grace Mayweather of the Tionisla government. "We see this sort of thing all the time. It's just a last bit of mischief from the recently deceased. Tricks, codes â€“ sometimes even traps for the unwary. People go mad trying to work these things out, but they never mean anything." 

The identity of the Commander in question is not known, but the ship was identified as an antique Cobra Mk III with the unusual hull registry of 'Cor meum et animam'.
