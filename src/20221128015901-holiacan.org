* 0125 Holiacan History                                 :beacon:EliteHistory:
Relatively late to joining the original [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][Alliance]] group in 3244,
Holiacan was not contested by [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]] forces as the systems assets
were relatively small. The bloodless revolution is a complete contrast
to its partner and robotic manufacturing rival [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]], whose [[id:469157dc-db54-4770-937b-1fb3ded39ff7][industry]]
in this area had been expanded into the system in 3229.

Since this time, robotics manufacturing and output within the Holiacan
has increased. Several other prominent political figures in Alliance
politics have emerged from this system, most notably [[id:a1bb9563-3e6b-44b1-a230-b281fc635cb3][Lucinda Kallis]],
who wields considerable influence amongst the system group.
