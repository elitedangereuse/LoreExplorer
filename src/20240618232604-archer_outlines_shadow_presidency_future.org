* Archer Outlines Shadow Presidency Future

/04 Dec 3309/

Vice President Jerome Archer has discussed the recent Federal presidential election and other topics during an interview with The Federal Times. 

On the victory of President-elect Felicia Winters: 

“Winters fought a clean campaign based on issues, as I did, so one cannot fault her for that. But I think the harsh realities of governance will quickly overwhelm her liberal idealism. Hudson, whatever his critics may think of him, was never afraid to take decisive action. We’ll see if Winters can do the same.” 

On Archer’s electoral policies: 

“I maintain that a security-first approach is the correct one, given the many threats facing the Federation. The [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] are not the only enemy of our people. Dismantling the Proactive Detection Bureau, as Winters has threatened to do, will be an act of self-sabotage for our entire society.” 

On his relationship with outgoing President Zachary Hudson: 

“It’s been an honour to support President Hudson, from whom I have learned a great deal about the political arena. Both of us are genuine patriots with similar viewpoints. I know he will continue to serve [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] in his own way.” 

On his future political career: 

“As shadow president, it will be my duty to not only scrutinise Winters’s administration, but also restore electoral faith in the Republican Party. I’m confident that the citizens will be fully on board with our policies by the next election, if not sooner.” 

In response to this interview, an editorial in the Federal Free Press said: 

“Jerome Archer’s priority now is to gather Hudson loyalists under his banner, and position himself as a worthy successor. But this tactic of talking about all subjects except his own lack of responsibility for the election loss will not fool voters. Once the PDB is gone, and we see the improvements wrought by a Liberal Party administration, Archer faces a considerable challenge to avoid becoming a footnote in the Federation’s history.”
