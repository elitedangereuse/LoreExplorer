* Galactic News: [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] Releases Statement

/25 Nov 3302/

Earlier this month, engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] announced a research programme designed to uncover the secrets of the Synuefe ruins. The engineer asked pilots to deliver data from the site to his laboratory in the hope that he would be able to decipher it. 

But Ran Tah's silence has prompted some to speculate that the engineer might not be up to the task of decoding the data, and that his attempt was nothing more than the naive dream of a backwater mechanic. 

When approached with these criticisms, [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] said: 

"These things take time. I believe I have made a breakthrough, but I will not be pressured into offering untested claims. As soon as I have results, the galaxy will know."
