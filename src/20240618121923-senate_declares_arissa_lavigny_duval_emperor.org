* Senate Declares [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] Emperor

/06 Oct 3301/

Standing on the steps of the Senate building, Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] announced the Senate's decision on the succession. In a historic selection, and as a result of a clear majority vote, [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] will be the next ruler of the Empire. She will be the first female leader of the Empire since Marlin Duval founded the original colony on Achenar in the 23rd Century, although she will carry the title 'Emperor' rather than 'Empress'. Such an appointment would have been impossible prior to the reign of [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] due to an ancient decree that all Imperial rulers be male, but a ruling passed by the late Emperor early in his reign did away with this generations-old tradition. 

The news has been almost universally celebrated, and even Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] offered her support for the appointment. The celebrations are likely to continue until the coronation ceremony in a week's time. 

Not everyone agrees with the Senate's decision, however. In a statement, Emperor's Dawn declared the selection of [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] "a desecration of the traditions of the Empire". The organisation has vowed not to allow the ceremony to happen.
