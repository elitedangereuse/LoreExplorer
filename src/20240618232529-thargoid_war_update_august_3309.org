* Thargoid War Update: August 3309

/29 Aug 3309/

[[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]’s [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] reviews developments in the ongoing war
against the Thargoids.

“There have been some impressive territorial gains against the
Thargoids in recent weeks. The number of systems controlled by the
[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titans]]’ invasion fleets has tumbled, allowing many millions of people
to return to their homes. This is largely thanks to coordinated action
by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons.”

“However, I take no pleasure in reporting that the ‘unsubstantiated
rumours’ I discussed last month are true. The Thargoids’ increased
interest in capturing escape pods has been verified, with the
appearance of a new vessel designed for this very task. Scythe-class
hunters are now launching attacks en masse, using a combination of
unique hull-breaching munitions and recovery drones to abduct living
people.”

“It’s believed that the [[id:0c83348f-ca8a-4bb2-97ff-c497b9a010f0][Scythes]] were responsible for the disappearance
of thousands aboard the Dedicant. There’s a horrific irony that most
of these abductees were members of the Order of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]], finally
getting their wish to be saved by their ‘angels’. From the logs found
aboard the megaship, adrift in the [[id:53a2feaa-72e3-40b0-ac54-624f2e33e305][HIP 19600]] system, there was nothing
holy about the experience.”

“It’s fair to say that these latest revelations are further proof of
the fluid nature of the war. They prove that the Thargoids are still
adapting their tactics to the current challenge humans provide. What
purposes they may have for human specimens remains unknown. But the
psychological impact of that mystery – not knowing what they’re doing
with the people they capture – will weaken the morale of many
anti-xeno fighters.”

“Another discovery this month was a planetary site in the [[id:800924c4-1b40-46e2-a929-3da627d6caef][Wregoe BU-Y
b2-0]] system. This contained both Guardian ruins and crashed Thargoid
vessels, and is only the second of its kind ever recorded. More
intriguingly, Thargoids active in the region are not attacking human
ships on sight.”

“Several pilots told me that this is still normal Thargoid behaviour
near some of our populated nebula colonies. But xeno-peace activists
feel that this discovery presents an opportunity. The [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway
Bioscience Institute]] is already planning an independent research
expedition to the area. We’ll be watching what happens there very
closely.”

“This is [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] for Vox Galactica. Now more than ever, stay
safe out there.”
