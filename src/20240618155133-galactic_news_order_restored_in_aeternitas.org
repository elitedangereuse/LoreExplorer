* Galactic News: Order Restored in Aeternitas

/15 Dec 3302/

Aeternitas Industries has announced that its campaign to clear the Aeternitas system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in Aeternitas have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at Houtman City.
