* 0167 First Interstellar Colony
[[id:da11b7b5-2c5a-4f17-9cd4-ce28a2f34dbd][Tau Ceti]]  

Tau Ceti was the first colony established outside of [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]. Tau Ceti 3
(now called [[id:ee59bbe7-79e2-49ae-a2bc-c25554526ea3][Taylor Colony]]) had long been determined viable for
habitation with life already present (due to free oxygen detected in
the atmosphere absorption spectra) - though observation and probe data
confirmed this. By 2159, the settlement was largely self-sufficient
and able to elect a civilian administrator.
