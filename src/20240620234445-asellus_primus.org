#+begin_quote
Rich, low population high tech economy (independent corporate state).

An independent corporate-run binary system, with a central white F7V
star and, further out, a captured planet-less M3V red dwarf. The
capture event millions of years earlier doubtless stripped Asellus
Primus B of any planets that might have formed with it. Asellus Primus
is known for its [[id:4c51911b-6266-4575-abcb-96a18b3800b7][high tech]] manufacturing. Also known as 23 Theta Bootis.
