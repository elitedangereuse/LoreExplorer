* Arissa Accepts Marlinists’ Independence

/12 Apr 3308/

Following a referendum by the Marlinist Colonies, Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] has formally recognised their autonomous status. 

Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate reported on his latest meeting with the Emperor: 

“Her Majesty was clearly uncomfortable with the democratic way in which the ex-Imperial citizens in the colonies now govern themselves. But she gracefully acknowledged that the Marlinist population had declined her invitation to become an Imperial protectorate, and would thus remain independent.” 

“However, there was a proviso to Emperor Arissa’s acceptance of the decision. She insisted that the Marlinist Colonies must work with the Empire’s intelligence agencies to prevent any resurgence of the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] or similar terrorist groups.” 

It has since been agreed that Imperial Intelligence and the Marlinist Constabulary would collaborate on identifying Neo-Marlinist extremists. Colonel Saskia Landau and Major Milo Castile, both former co-leaders of ACT, have agreed to work together once again. 

In recognition of the minority who voted to rejoin the Empire, dedicated customs and immigration channels for registered Marlinist citizens will soon be established.
