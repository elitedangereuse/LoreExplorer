In July 3305, Palin was forced to abandon his research centre when the
[[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] entered the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system en mass. Together with his team,
Palin was evacuated to the Arque system, where he wasted no time in
establishing a new base of operations at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E.ยน
