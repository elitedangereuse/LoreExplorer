* 0118 Tom Quaterson Death
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

Having smuggled weapons into the system, the tension between the
[[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Cakers]] and the authorities was always going to spill over
eventually. In 2617, the death of [[id:63533857-27f5-474b-9885-ade924f8877a][Tom Quaterson]], a munitions worker
who had been convicted of selling food coupons to the poor, was the
spark that lit the flame of revolt. Workers on the gas platforms
seized control of the facilities and planetside, the general populace
stormed the Governor's residence.

[[id:3f4b114b-adf2-4150-8408-d86406848f0d][Quentin Deviseses]] wasn't just a revolutionary. He had a long term
strategy for the system and as soon as the planet was secure, used
every means he could to get the word out that [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] would become a
free trade port.

The resource implication of [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]'s independence was too much for
either the Empire or the Federation to take.
