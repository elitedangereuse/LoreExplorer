* Community Goal: [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]' Big Jump

/05 May 3302/

Equipped with a cluster of drive engines, [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station is noted for
being the galaxy's only travelling starport. Owned and operated by a
cyborg known as '[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]', the [[id:d5cc8c3e-9887-4c30-9a1d-08008ab36675][Orbis]] station has been roaming the
galaxy for over 40 years, and in that time it has become something of
a cultural icon. Now, after more than four decades of travel, [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]
is about to embark on his most ambitious expedition yet â€“ a
long-distance jump from [[id:ab3ea80d-bf90-482c-bcf1-63f1d2f1b21f][Gliese 1269]] to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]].

In a statement, [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] explained the thinking behind the venture. 

"Well, I've been wandering the galaxy for over forty years now, and
the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] is that after a while, travel starts to lose its
allure. You've got to remember, I've been alive for several
centuries. The things that used to excite you just sort of...lose
their spark. I thought a long-distance leap might rekindle my
enthusiasm."

Naturally, moving a starport such a considerable distance requires a
significant amount of fuel, which is why [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] has turned to
celebrated search-and-rescue organisation the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] for help. The
Fuel Rats, in turn, have issued an appeal to their many members and
supporters to contribute fuel to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]'s operation. The [[id:78dc1804-9537-4e52-bba1-ca98efd86229][Fuel Rats
Mischief]], which is coordinating the operation, has promised to
generously reward those who support the operation.

The campaign begins on the 5th of May 3302 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.
