* Thargoid War Update: May 3309

/29 May 3309/

Vox Galactica’s [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] reports on the discovery of the Titans, and new Thargoid craft both in space and on occupied worlds. 

“The true scale of the challenge facing humanity became evident this month, when we finally learned what was within the Maelstroms. It has long been theorised that the Thargoids have ‘motherships’ of some kind. But few were prepared for the shocking reality of the Titans, squatting at the centre of the corrosive clouds like bloated spiders in their webs. I can’t be the only one whose guts knotted with fear when I first saw those floating monstrosities.” 

“The Maelstroms also revealed a new type of Thargoid vessel, the aggressive Glaive-class hunter. Resembling multi-bladed throwing knives, these quickly drew blood as they hurled viciously into our midst. There are reports of Glaives sighted within systems that have fallen to the Thargoid invasion fleets, interdicting any ship that crosses their path.” 

“Further surprises were to come within those systems, when ground troops became stalked by heavily armed drones. The Revenants, as they have been named, seem to be actively defending abandoned settlements from human intruders. Again, this contributes to the impression that the Thargoids desire a permanent presence on our worlds.” 

“On a positive note, Aegis’s forthcoming pulse wave xeno scanner should prove instrumental in gathering data about the Titans. A well-received public address by Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] cemented the significance of Aegis in the war, despite [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]]’s CEO [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] somewhat predictably criticising it as ‘self-congratulatory hot air’.” 

“With such technological breakthroughs and fierce resistance on the front line, there’s a long way to go before the Thargoids can lay claim to the core systems. This is [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade Sanderlyn]] for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”
