/30 Jul 3305/

Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] has established a permanent base of operations in the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system. 

Aegis Research confirmed the news with a statement from Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]]: 

“Having fled the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system, Professor Palin and his staff have installed their equipment at the planetary port Abel Laboratory on [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] 4 E.” 

“All of the engineering services previously offered by Professor Palin are now available at his new location. His study of meta-alloys and other Thargoid-related materials has also resumed.” 

“The megaship Carson’s Spring, which facilitated an emergency evacuation of the Palin Research Centre, has left the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system to resume other duties.”
