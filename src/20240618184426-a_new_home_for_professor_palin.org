* A New Home for Professor Palin

/30 Jul 3305/

Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] has established a permanent base of operations in the Arque system. 

Aegis Research confirmed the news with a statement from Professor Alba Tesreau: 

“Having fled the Maia system, Professor Palin and his staff have installed their equipment at the planetary port Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E.” 

“All of the engineering services previously offered by Professor Palin are now available at his new location. His study of meta-alloys and other Thargoid-related materials has also resumed.” 

“The megaship Carson’s Spring, which facilitated an emergency evacuation of the Palin Research Centre, has left the Arque system to resume other duties.”
