On June 17th 3302 a fleet of over 4,000 survey and support vessels
departed from Mitterand Hollow in Epsilon Indi. The Crab Nebula
Expedition was the largest coordinated flight of explorers since the
Distant Worlds Expedition. It attracted a wide range of pilots, from
veterans to beginners taking their first trip outside the
