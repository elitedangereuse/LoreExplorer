* 0698 Former Federal President Found
[[id:442e6f9a-19d8-48e2-9fb6-a6cb88b22c45][Azaleach]]

On February 26th 3302 Federal President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] made a
surprising announcement: one of the escape pods taken to [[id:25f2fe11-0dd5-4769-8166-6807d1e577a7][Leoniceno
Orbital]] contains former Federal President [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]].

"When we started searching for the remains of [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]] it was with
the aim of discovering what happened to the ship. I never imagined we
would find survivors, and certainly not that one of them would be
Jasmina Halsey."
