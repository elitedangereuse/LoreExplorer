* Alliance Admiral Detained

/13 Jul 3304/

A member of the Alliance Council of Admirals has been arrested by the taskforce investigating terrorist organisation the League of Reparation. 

Admiral [[id:c51f8115-13d1-4d47-a88a-a126cd66d194][George Varma]] was confronted by Captain [[id:cdaa5220-8f79-47dc-b160-a5d3d1ca30a0][Niamh Seutonia]] and Senior Agent [[id:fb74a286-1688-41e8-9bec-9ef14adaaf1f][Tanya Ramirez]] during a meeting of admiralty staff at the Donaldson starport in Alioth. Despite protests, he was placed under arrest and escorted to a secure facility. 

Captain Seutonia gave a brief statement to the media: 

“We have been trying to determine how the League of Reparation gained access to military-issue weapons, equipment and encryption. We now have evidence that Admiral Varma was secretly redirecting cargo shipments from the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] to terrorist cells. It’s highly likely that Varma is Nexus, the organisation’s coordinator, and we are proceeding on that assumption.” 

The arrest has created diplomatic ripples, with Federal and Imperial ambassadors being summoned before the Alliance Assembly. Council member Jed Trager told The Alliance Tribune: 

“For agents of the Federal Intelligence Agency and Imperial Internal Security Service to abduct an Alliance admiral is an egregious transgression. They will not get away with this.” 

The Council of Admirals has called for an independent inquiry to verify the accusations levied at Admiral Varma. Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] made a public statement: 

“This has come as a great shock, but the body of evidence against Admiral Varma is considerable. I am confident that the trial will be fair, and that our own representative within the tri-superpower taskforce will ensure that justice is done.” 

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.
