* Community Goal: The Battle for [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] Continues

/10 Nov 3302/

Two weeks ago, conflict erupted between the Ant Hill Mob and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system. But this was no ordinary inter-factional dispute. According to various sources, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise was acting under direct orders from Federation officials eager to bring Maia under Federal control. 

With both sides bolstered by Pilots Federation Commanders, the battle was intense and wide ranging. After several days of conflict it was the Pleiades Resource Enterprise that emerged victorious, successfully gaining a foothold in [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]]. 

But it seems the battle for [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] is far from over. Recent reports indicate that the Ant Hill Mob is about to launch a retaliatory assault with the aim of pushing the Pleiades Resource Enterprise out of Maia. 

The organisation has devised a two-pronged strategy to regain control, and has appealed to the galactic community for support. In addition to targeting Pleiades Resource Enterprise fighters, the Ant Hill Mob has asked pilots to deliver battle weapons to system security forces, who will be supporting the Ant Hill Mob during the conflict. 

Pilots who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded. 

The campaign begins on the 10th of November 3302 and will run for one week.
