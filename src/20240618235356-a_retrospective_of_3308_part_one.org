#+title: A Retrospective of 3308 (Part One)
#+filetags: :Empire:Federation:Alliance:Thargoid:3309:galnet:3308:

In the first of a three-part series of articles, the historian [[id:e13ec234-b603-4a29-870d-2b87410195ea][Sima
Kalhana]] reviews the key events of the past year.

“3308 began with the announcement that the Alliance and [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius
Corporation]] had agreed an anti-xeno strategic defence pact. This
controversial decision would face many challenges before it was
ratified, including armed rebellion in the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system.

One of the pact’s driving forces was the loss of Aegis, disbanded
following the publication of the [[id:f87fc526-4e0d-4019-aa88-15d40da45ac9][Baumann Report]]. Even the rediscovery
of the lost megaship [[id:4d4f19a9-5100-4307-ac1b-f40ae90e806c][Alexandria]] could not prevent [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]]’s shutdown,
despite evidence that it had been raided by agents with ties of
[[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]].

The superpowers began establishing their own anti-xeno taskforces and
research projects. But their focus was on the mysterious scientist
named [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]], who was developing a [[id:6023377d-7271-49d1-80ec-ffab82dc8c29][superweapon]] that promised great
victories against the Thargoids.

In February, the atrocities of the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army]]
(NMLA) were finally halted. A cabal of Imperial senators named the
[[id:ffa239ce-f149-4c43-9455-26a4fa753e1c][Lords of Restoration]] were exposed as its masterminds, planning to oust
the [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duval]] and grant exclusive power to the [[id:b1182341-2de3-4e2c-8056-2bcea537233a][Senate]].

This came with the shock discovery that Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]]
had been [[id:c6cec7ba-fab9-4a53-ae69-9e1b6f2d9937][abducted]] by the Lords of Restoration over a year ago,
replaced by a virtual [[id:7a5deea9-1363-4fe7-8be9-b60f9943f302][doppelganger]] communicating via [[id:45d78e5d-27b7-48cb-97b2-012934be3180][Imperial
Intelligence]] channels. The private military firm [[id:57907627-04a8-4987-96c2-535c101e958b][Darkwater Inc]], which
had trained the terrorists, was wiped out in the [[id:1c3c89a5-8dc4-4b46-9266-78a85d66a1a6][Battle of
Summerland]]. This victory was notable for ending the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] threat and
returning Arissa to the throne.

There was also drama within the Federation, as President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary
Hudson]] proposed to remove the fixed term limit for presidents. This
would allow him to stand for re-election in 3309. The [[id:989656c7-b16b-47f8-b114-bde1bac26f13][Hudson
Contravention]] brought public unrest, which only calmed when the
congress decided to postpone their vote. It remains an outstanding
issue, even as a presidential election year approaches.

March saw the completion of the [[id:97a8c7e5-9399-4ebe-9457-8029ce809303][Colonia Bridge]], after several
multi-stage initiatives. Starports and stationary megaships now formed
a permanent travel corridor from the core systems to the distant
[[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region.

The Thargoids emerged again in April with the invasion of the [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]],
[[id:b38c4ed0-3aaa-4a86-8acd-a241164d680f][Novas]] and [[id:2a81ce70-848a-46eb-aa0b-b5626e78e8aa][Sosong]] systems. This brought an opportunity for the
superpowers to work together with [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]. Interviews with [[id:139670fe-bd19-40b6-8623-cceeef01fd36][Jade
Sanderlyn]] provided insights into each superpower’s approach. Within
mere months, their reliance on Salvation would lead to an event that
altered the course of history.
