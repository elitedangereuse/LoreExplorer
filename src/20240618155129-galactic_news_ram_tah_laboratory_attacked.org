* Galactic News: [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] Laboratory Attacked

/02 Dec 3302/

A few days ago, the research centre at Felice Dock in the Meene system was severely damaged in what has been described as 'an act of vandalism'. Authorities at the starport have confirmed that the attack left many of the facilities irreparably damaged. 

Readers will no doubt recall that Ram Tah's research project into the ruins of the Synuefe XR-H d11-102 system is based at Felice Dock. 

When asked about the delay in investigating the crime, system security forces said it was considered 'low priority', and that it was "probably the work of opportunists." 

Ram Tah released the following statement: 

"This is clearly an attempt to undermine my research into the Synuefe ruins. Since my investigations began, a number of agencies have made clear their desire to capitalise on the site for personal, political or military gain. The knowledge contained in the ruins does not belong to one individual or organisation â€“ it belongs to everyone." 

"My research programme has relocated to Phoenix Base. Strict security protocols have been instated, and anyone approaching without invitation will be fired upon." 

Since this statement was made, the research facility at Phoenix Base has been operating in total radio silence.
