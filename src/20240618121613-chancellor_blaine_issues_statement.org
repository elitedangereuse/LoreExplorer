Chancellor Blaine Issues Statement 
 
With no clear successor to the Emperor, Chancellor Blaine has accepted the task of governing [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] until the succession has been determined. He reiterated his statement that the matter would be resolved after Emperor’s funeral. He then revealed more about the investigation into the regicide: 

“Officers from the Imperial Guard and Imperial Intelligence Security Service have begun their investigation and are being provided with the resources they need. 

“The assassin has been identified as Brendan Paul Darius. Senator Patreus has confirmed that the man was a member of his entourage, and the Senator is helping with the investigation. Darius killed the Emperor in a savage attack using a concealed blade, and a separate investigation has been launched to determine how he was able to sneak a weapon into the Emperor’s presence. 

“Darius was killed by the Emperor’s Guard during the attack, and we have as yet been unable to determine his motive for the murder.” 

For the remainder of the session, the gathered senators offered support and words of condolence to the Imperial family.
