* The Declaration of Archon Delaine

/08 Mar 3307/

At the Galactic Summit, the infamous pirate leader [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] has demanded to be accepted as the legitimate leader of a political power. 

A gap in the schedule allowed him to make an address in the main conference chamber: 

“Most of you see me as a common criminal, rather than the rightful ruler of multiple systems. That must end now! My efforts to build a Kumo nation deserve respect. I am here to declare my sovereignty and take my rightful place on the political stage.” 

This was immediately dismissed by many delegations. Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] said this was a barbaric mockery of nobility, while Shadow President Winters asked how much bloodshed the pirates had caused to obtain their power. [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] replied: 

“Are you all so innocent, then? Every civilisation begins with barbarism, and maintains authority with the threat of violence. None of you can say otherwise. We all wear a crown of bones.” 

There followed intense debate as to whether the Kumo Crew’s territory could be recognised as a new nation-state or was simply a rebranded crime syndicate. There is suspicion that some of the many criminal vessels detected in the Sirius system are from Delaine’s pirate fleet. 

The Federal and Imperial delegations have offered to remove Archon Delaine’s retinue, only to be reminded that Sirius Corporation has granted them full diplomatic immunity.
