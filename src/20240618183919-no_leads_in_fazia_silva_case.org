* No Leads in [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]] Case

/31 Oct 3304/

The investigation into the death of Alliance presidential candidate [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]] has concluded. No convictions have been made. 

Inspector Erin Sangster of Alliance Interpol made this statement: 

“The death of [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]] has been officially ruled as homicide. The use of a sophisticated nerve toxin and the circumvention of security at Hume Orbital suggests the involvement of one or more professional assassins.” 

“Unfortunately, we have now exhausted all possible avenues of investigation, and are left with no option but to consider the case closed.” 

President [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]] told the media: 

“I have no doubt that the murder of Ms Silva was designed to disrupt our democracy, and I will not rest until the Alliance’s enemies pay for their crimes.” 

Tashmira Silva has now assumed permanent control of her late sister’s corporate empire.
