* Galactic News: Kuun-Lan Campaign Concludes

/13 Oct 3303/

A spokesperson for the Kuun-Lan has announced that its appeal for commodities was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Lomonosov City, the organisation’s base of operations. 

A spokesperson for the group released the following statement: 

“We are overjoyed that the galactic community has rallied to our cause, and we are immensely grateful to all those who participated.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lomonosov City in the HIP 104292 system.
