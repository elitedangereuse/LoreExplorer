* Twin Initiatives for [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge Project

/07 Oct 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Delivery campaigns in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] systems aim to improve journeys to the distant colonies. 

The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge project is being funded by Brewer Corporation, which outlined the details in a press release: 

“The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region has great potential for businesses and travellers, but the long voyage can be prohibitive. Brewer Corporation is investing in the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia, to make crossing those thousands of light years easier.” 

“Up to 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the route to [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]], providing travellers with valuable respite and resources including tritium. These stationary megaships should be operational by the 28th of October, and will mark the completion of the first phase of the three-phase Colonia Bridge project. Its aim is to place dockable megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and Colonia systems.” 

“To achieve this, we require large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units. These can be delivered to either Macdonald Settlement in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] system or [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] system.” 

The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Council is subsidising part of the initiative, due to the importance of this enterprise. As a consequence, the commodity requirements for the megaships at [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station are reduced. 

Brewer Corporation has confirmed that as well as offering payment for the materials, it will ask the top ten contributors at [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] to submit potential names for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. 

As an added incentive, there will be temporary discounts on purchasing and outfitting fleet carriers at both Macdonald Settlement and Jacques Station, based on pilots’ contributions.
