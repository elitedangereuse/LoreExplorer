* Disowned Heiress Admits Gambling Addiction

/09 Mar 3305/

The former heiress to the Ambrose Foundation has confessed that she lost her family’s entire fortune through excessive gambling. 

Lady Talitha – now ordinary Talitha Ambrose – provided this statement to Vox Galactica: 

“Everything you’ve read is true. I attended a lavish event hosted by Jokers’ Deck, staked the entire Ambrose estate and lost it all. But I don’t regret a thing.” 

“The gambling problem I’ve suffered with for years has finally been cured. I believe my addiction was fuelled by having far more wealth than any individual should. I now plan to use my connections to raise funds for addiction support charities.” 

“I don’t blame Jokers’ Deck for my situation, since I knew the risks when I joined. And frankly, it could have been worse – I’ve seen corporations won and lost over a hand of deadlock poker.”
