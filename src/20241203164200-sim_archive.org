The archive is a vast collection of memories stored as sims, allowing
others to relive the experiences of [[id:058a658d-e1ce-4364-a92b-b9607495c73f][Utopian]] pilgrims in the form of
vivid virtual reality experiences. In the past, those sims have been
used to educate Utopians and to reform dissidents within the
community.
