* Galactic News: [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Appeal Concludes

/13 Oct 3302/

It has been four weeks since the [[id:2de1afc0-4c9d-4e31-bc15-ba9961087ddd][Latugara]] PLC announced plans to establish a series of outposts between the burgeoning [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula community and the core of human-inhabited space. 

Since then, the galactic community has delivered huge quantities of materials to Love Orbital for use in the construction. 

A spokesperson for the [[id:2de1afc0-4c9d-4e31-bc15-ba9961087ddd][Latugara]] PLC released a statement, thanking those who contributed to the campaign: 

"We are hugely grateful to the many Commanders who supported this initiative. You have done a great deal to facilitate travel to and from the nascent [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] community. Construction of the new outposts is expected to begin within the next few weeks." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Love Orbital in the [[id:2de1afc0-4c9d-4e31-bc15-ba9961087ddd][Latugara]] system.
