* Galactic News: Let the Festivities Commence

/19 May 3302/

The Diamond Frogs have announced that their campaign to bring party supplies to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. A huge number of deliveries were made for the explorers' gala, which will celebrate the achievements of the Distant Worlds explorers. 

A spokesperson for the Diamond Frogs released a brief statement: 

"We knew O'Malligan's would throw a fine party, but we're delighted to have received the support we needed to become the galaxy's number one party spot. Explorers will now spread word of this party to the galactic rim. We couldn't be happier." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital.
