* Leaders Respond to Azimuth Initiative

/01 Jul 3308/

The anti-xeno operation in HIP 22460 involving [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] and the superpowers has drawn comments from prominent political figures. 

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval: “I agree with Senator Patreus that supporting Azimuth’s proposal remains our most practical course of action. However, alternative options for tackling the Thargoid threat are required.” 

Princess Aisling Duval: “Salvation is clearly a master of self-promotion and public manipulation. I only hope that the Empire does not regret associating with this distasteful individual.” 

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon: “Our military presence in HIP 22460, coupled with the strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation, shows that the long-term security of Allied systems remains our priority.” 

Councillor Nakato Kaine: “Two ruthless corporations with disreputable histories, and the Alliance is now collaborating with both. This a deeply regrettable chapter in our history.” 

President Zachary Hudson: “I have every confidence in the Federal Navy to protect [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] while the Proteus Wave is prepared. This is a long-overdue reprisal against an intractable and relentless enemy.” 

Shadow President Felicia Winters: “Azimuth’s superweapon is effective, I’ll admit. But I’m unhappy with relying on this clandestine organisation, rather than an accountable anti-xeno agency.” 

CEO Li Yong-Rui: “Sirius Corporation is observing activities in HIP 22460 with great interest. I am keen to explore cooperation with [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] on developing new products using Proteus Wave technology.” 

Simguru Pranav Antal: “The advanced electromagnetic sciences developed by the Guardians over a million years ago remain poorly understood, even to Utopia’s keenest minds. The safety and effectiveness of [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s device cannot be guaranteed.”
