* Pharma Giant Begins Onionhead Project

/02 Sep 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Neomedical Industries has requested deliveries to produce onionhead gamma strain for Alliance and independent systems. 

The new variant of the popular psychedelic drug is currently sold in a handful of independent systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate. The IHO has confirmed that the product does have many medical applications. 

Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, outlined the initiative: 

“Our goal is to gather sufficient resources for the manufacture of onionhead gamma strain as a medicinal treatment. Target markets will include both independent and Alliance systems, should enough commodities be delivered.” 

“We request that pilots transport H.E. suits, polymers and robotics to Crippen Port in the Haithis system. Reimbursements will be arranged by our corporate partner, the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group.” 

The Kumo Council has despatched a megaship, the Mictlan, to the Haithis system. A message was broadcast by [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]], warlord of the Kumo Crew: 

“I’m prepared to give this greedy corporation time to reconsider stealing our commercial property. I’m also prepared to massacre everyone in the system. Your choice.” 

In response, the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group has agreed to offer bounty vouchers in order to protect ships from pirates and other wanted vessels.
