* The Purge of Socho

/16 Mar 3304/

Following reports of Thargoid incursions into the core systems, Aegis Core has launched a counter-Thargoid operation in the Socho region. 

A spokesperson for Aegis Core gave the following statement to the media: 

“The goal is simple: Take out Thargoid vessels, gather up the pieces, and deliver them to Dantec Enterprise. We don’t know as much about the Scouts as we do the Interceptors, so we want to compare materials from both variants and find out what they are made of.” 

Aegis Core has appealed to independent pilots to support the operation by destroying Thargoids in Socho and by delivering Bio-Mechanical Conduits, Propulsion Elements and Weapon Parts to Dantec Enterprise. Commanders who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded. 

The campaign begins on the 15th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
