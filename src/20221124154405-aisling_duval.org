* Aisling Duval

#+begin_quote

  "My grandfather had an heirloom he used to keep in our winter palace.
  It was a priceless marble statuette of one of our ancestors standing
  with his food on a woman's neck while she looks up at him in fear, or
  adoration -- probably both. I loathed it. It was commissioned to
  commemorate some victory or other, but that wasn't the point of the
  thing. The message was clear, and it's the same one I've heard all my
  life: deep down, the people we dominate are happy to be dominated."

  "When I was six years old, I smashed it. The servants came running. My
  father stormed down the staris in his gown. He asked if it was an
  accident. There was such a strange look in his eyes. I knew that if I
  said yes, nobody would argue. Nothing more would be said. But I
  didn't. I stamped my foot and said 'No, Daddy, I did it on
  purpose!'"

  "It's the same with tradition. The people who pass it on think it's
  precious. They expect you to cherish it and pass it on in turn. But
  what they think doesn't matter, because the responsibility rests with
  you. If you know it's wrong, then you have to smash it. On purpose."

  --- Aisling Duval, A Fireside Chat with Serena, 3301

Princess Aisling Duval, born in 3276, is a prominent member of the
Imperial Royal family. The eldest child of the infamous Prince Harold,
she had a troubled upbringing. Her father was notorious for his
hedonistic lifestyle, while her mother, entertainer Imogen 'Eccentrica'
Gabrielini, died from an aneurysm shortly after Aisling's birth. The
autopsy identified the cause of death as an overdose of Purple Sunflake,
an obscure and expensive narcotic, but conspiracy theorists insisted
that she was murdered to remove an embarrassment to the Royal family.
Aisling had indicated that she is aware of these rumours, but has never
commented on them.

Despite living a life of great privilege, Aisling has publicly embraced
the cause of the less fortunate and become an outspoken opponent of
slavery -- something that has made her the target of fierce criticism
from more traditionalist Imperials.

But despite this criticism, Aisling is a popular figure with a
widespread media presence. Her campaigning has brought definite benefits
to many of the poorest in Imperial society, and gone some way towards
easing tensions between the Empire and the Federation. Her critics,
however, dismiss her as a puppet, doing the bidding of a shadowy circle
of advisors. they claim there is no underlying coherence to Aisling's
policies. To them, she is a naive and sentimental child without the
necessary experience for politics, backing one populist cause after
another, always conscious of how her activism is affecting her 'brand.'

Significantly, the most savage of Aisling's critics and the staunchest
of her defenders agree on a counterpoint to this: that her apparent
vacuity is nothing but a front, carefully created in collusion with the
very advisors whom others believe are exploiting her. The 'people's
princess', they argue, is exceptionallly good at being underestimated.

Following the death of Hengist Duval in 3301, Aisling was considered by
many to be a viable contender for the Imperial throne. As Aisling was
born out of wedlock, however, and her father was removed from the line
of succession on the grounds of mental incapacity, Arissa Lavigny-Duval
was deemed to have the stronger claim.
