* State Funeral Held for Prince Harold Duval

/24 Sep 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders* 

Rare commodities required by the Empire in the Baal system. 

The state funeral of Prince Harold Duval has begun on Capitol. An official week of mourning has been declared throughout the Empire. 

Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] opened the ceremony, delivering a eulogy for her half-brother. Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]], Haroldâ€™s daughter, was also in attendance but was too emotional to address the huge crowds. 

Messages of condolence from across the galaxy were on holographic display, including from Alliance Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] and Federal President Zachary Hudson. Even Hadrian Duval, the exiled leader of Nova Imperium, paid respects to his late uncle. 

The body of the Prince, contained within a jewelled transparent casket, was paraded through the city by a company of Imperial Guard. It will remain in state for two weeks prior to internment in the Hall of Martyrs. 

The Imperial Palace will host a memorial ceremony to honour Harold Duval, for which rare commodities have been requested before Thursday 1st October. Ngadandari Fire Opals, Esuseku Caviar, Lavian Brandy and Kamitra Cigars should be delivered to Oterma Station in the Baal system, where the White Templars will transport them to Capitol after security vetting. 

Commanders of the Pilots Federation will be assigned an Achenar system permit alongside financial rewards. To further encourage participation, Gutamaya Corporation will apply a discount of up to 25% for all ship purchases according to the amount of rare items provided.
