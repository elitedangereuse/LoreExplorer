* 0157 Durius Defaults
[[id:c0ca77c2-1994-4f1c-9f14-b839171da15a][Durius]]

In December 3300, the impoverished Durius system defaulted on the loan
granted it by Imperial Senator Denton Patreus. Talks with Governor
[[id:c40dc5c5-449b-4046-be6d-a2712c565e34][Malachai]] were to no avail and war was declared. Despite facing
devastating odds, the Durius system fought back valiantly. Senator
[[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Patreus]] was ultimately victorious, despite facing a desperate
opposition, and subsequently brought Durius into the fold as an
Imperial system.
