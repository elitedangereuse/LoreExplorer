* Galactic News: Terrorist Salomé Killed

/04 May 3303/

Imperial despatches have confirmed that Commander [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salomé]], also known as Kahina Tijani Loren, was killed in the Arumclaw system on the 29th of April by a bounty hunter known as ‘[[id:3210de12-8908-4eed-bc24-567190bac0a4][Besieger]]’. 

Salomé was escorted by several heavily armed vessels, but her Imperial Clipper ‘[[id:2a22eaa3-2e5b-4fce-bc9b-3afc5888753e][Seven Veils]]’ was nevertheless destroyed by weapons fire. Three commanders were seen fleeing Arumclaw shortly afterwards. 

Surveillance reports indicate that Salomé’s co-conspirators – [[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]], [[id:7bc38ab5-1b0b-4821-a335-41be23b62612][Tsu Annabelle Singh]] and [[id:35c30032-e8ba-4884-807c-c2a775ad0f85][Yuri Nakamura]] – remain at large. 

Moments after Salomé’s destruction was confirmed, a transmission was detected in the [[id:a4b56f51-d230-4f11-abdb-7e5ddf907b49][Teorge]] system, leading to the discovery of a series of logs. The logs, which apparently date from 3275, contain nebulous assertions regarding a scheme from an unidentified super organisation to manipulate the Empire, Federation and Alliance. 

A number of factions tried to defend Salomé and her allies as they travelled from 46 Eridani to the core systems. Imperial intelligence is reportedly trying to identify the factions that supported the conspirators, but anecdotal reports indicate that many have already fallen into disarray in the wake of Salomé’s death. 

“She was a force of evil who attempted to sow the seeds of conflict among those who strive for peace,” said Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]. “Her warmongering is at an end, and the galaxy is now a safer place. It’s just a shame that so many innocent lives were lost before she was brought down.” 

Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] refused to address claims that the bounty hunter was in his employ, saying only, “Let that be an end to this sorry affair”.
