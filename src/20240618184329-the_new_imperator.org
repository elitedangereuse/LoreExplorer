* The New Imperator

/31 Jan 3305/

[[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]] has broadcast a message following the purge of isolationist group Nova Imperium: 

[[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] has revealed the true face of her regime – one based on brutality and terror. The callous execution of Imperator Mordanticus, in conjunction with thousands of Imperial citizens, shows her desperation to cling onto power at any cost.” 

“Nova Imperium survives in the Paresa system, a single light in the darkness. We stand for an Empire that respects everyone, from slaves to senators. I truly hope that any who value honour and tradition will help keep our spark alive.” 

“Our martyred leader will never be forgotten. In his honour, I have taken the title of Imperator Duval, until such time as the people choose me as their rightful emperor.”  

“Memento Mordanticus!”
