* GalNet Galactic War Report

/28 Feb 3301/

The ongoing conflict between the Federal Navy and the Polahukuna Raiders has taken an unexpected turn this weekend, following reports that the Federation have begun work on a new Farragut class battlecruiser in the shipyards aboard Hudson Dock. For their part, the Polahukuna raiders appear to have returned home to lick their wounds. However, reports are coming in from BD+03 2338 that traders bringing supplies to Hudson Dock are coming under heavy fire from a band of imperial mercenaries known as the East India Company.The Imperial Senate is denying any knowledge of the attacks. 

In imperial space, the Citizens of Tradition, acting under the authority of Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]], have begun a full scale invasion of the [[id:80569507-5192-4d10-a072-7ddc2b0e5bac][Falisci]] system. The initiative to secure the spaceways around Dongzi and [[id:36dc081e-5308-4677-978e-cd9eee894d1b][Ngaiawang]] against criminal activities is being led from Dornier Terminal in Ngaiawang.
