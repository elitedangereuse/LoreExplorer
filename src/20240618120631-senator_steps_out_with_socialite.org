* Senator Steps Out with Socialite

/12 Mar 3301/

Senator Patreus and Aisling Duval have been spotted together at a number of popular nightspots in Capitol this week, leading some social commentators to speculate that the two may have become romantically involved. 

If true, the association could potentially secure Senator Patreusâ€™s bid to become the leading voice of the Empire. While Aisling herself is not currently considered a serious contender for the Imperial Throne, her pairing with the Senator could provide the leverage he needs to secure support from a large portion of the Senate, particularly from those who are currently throwing their weight behind Chancellor Blaine. 

When asked for comment, both Senator Patreus and Aisling Duval refused to answer any questions regarding their possible relationship.
