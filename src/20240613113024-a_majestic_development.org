On July 21st 3302 Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organization based in the Carthage system, launched a campaign to add three new Majestic-class interdictors to the Imperial fleet. / At a press conference, Lucius Lavigny confirmed that the Emperor had personally authorized the campaign. According to Lavigny, the initiative is a direct response to the Federation's "ongoing military build-up". The admiral closed the conference with the words: "We must continue to strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
