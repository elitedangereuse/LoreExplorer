* 0689 A Majestic Development
[[id:29b87d21-95e3-41c2-b43c-e5777025efa9][Carthage]]   

On July 21st 3302 [[id:d5617bfc-ed9f-4b4c-9bf1-6143fb9f7068][Lavigny's Legion]], an Imperial organization based in
the Carthage system, launched a campaign to add three new
Majestic-class interdictors to the Imperial fleet.

At a press conference, [[id:6debe91d-53f8-46de-9368-ce7dc555a58f][Lucius Lavigny]] confirmed that the Emperor had
personally authorized the campaign. According to Lavigny, the
initiative is a direct response to the Federation's "ongoing military
build-up". The admiral closed the conference with the words: "We must
continue to strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons."
