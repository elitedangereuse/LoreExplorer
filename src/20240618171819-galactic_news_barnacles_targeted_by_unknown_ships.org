* Galactic News: Barnacles Targeted by Unknown Ships

/04 Jun 3303/

Recent reports from the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 system indicate that the so-called Unknown Ships have begun interacting with the regionâ€™s barnacles. 

Eyewitnesses report that the ships have been seen targeting the barnacles with some kind of energy beam, apparently in order to extract matter from them. Pilots have also reported that their ships and SRVs spontaneously lose power while in proximity to the Unknown Ship. 

The news follows reports that the Unknown Ships have been seen at the locations of mysterious attacks in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system. 

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.
