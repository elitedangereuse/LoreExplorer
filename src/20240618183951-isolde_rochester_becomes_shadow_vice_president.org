* [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]] becomes Shadow Vice President

/26 Dec 3304/

Federal Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] has appointed [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]] as the deputy leader of the Federation’s Liberal Party. 

The new Shadow Vice President made a statement to the media: 

“After a decade of serving in Congress, supporting both President Halsey and Shadow President Winters, it is an honour to accept this position. Many challenges face the Federation, and the Liberal Party is ready to meet them.” 

The former deputy leader, Edgar Santiago, recently made the sudden decision to retire from politics and purchase a private luxury starship, despite not being known for extravagant spending. 

Isolde Rochester is the matriarch of the powerful Rochester family, which includes the CEO of Core Dynamics and two Federal Navy officers. Rumours suggest that she called off the wedding of her son Ambasador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] when suggestions arose of Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]’s infidelity.
