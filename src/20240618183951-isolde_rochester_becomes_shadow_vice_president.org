* [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]] becomes Shadow Vice President

/26 Dec 3304/

Federal Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] has appointed [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde
Rochester]] as the deputy leader of the Federation’s Liberal Party.

The new Shadow Vice President made a statement to the media:

“After a decade of serving in [[id:614fd344-ec09-483c-a28e-0289590946c4][Congress]], supporting both President
[[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Halsey]] and [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Shadow President Winters]], it is an honour to accept this
position. Many challenges face the Federation, and the [[id:4cfca8e0-b6a6-4e86-b777-4754f914fa3e][Liberal Party]]
is ready to meet them.”

The former deputy leader, [[id:44d34844-2c95-4459-b65f-0a07328e8626][Edgar Santiago]], recently made the sudden
decision to retire from politics and purchase a private luxury
starship, despite not being known for extravagant spending.

[[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]] is the matriarch of the powerful [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochester family]],
which includes the CEO of [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] and two [[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal Navy]]
officers. Rumours suggest that she called off the wedding of her son
Ambasador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] when suggestions arose of Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling
Duval]]’s infidelity.
