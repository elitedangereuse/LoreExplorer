* Galactic News: Order Restored in Colonia

/26 May 3303/

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council has announced that the agitators causing discord in the Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 system have been eliminated. Hundreds of pilots supported the operation, taking to their ships to tackle the criminals that had taken root in system. The Junkyard Dogs have also confirmed that security personnel have been stationed at the agitators’ outposts to prevent reoccupation. 

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Junkyard Dogs released a statement: 

“Colonia is more than just a system – it is a symbol. It cannot be allowed to fall into a quagmire of criminality and corruption like so many of the core systems. It must be protected. The pilots who purged Eol Prou Lw-L C8-215 of the criminals infesting it have our everlasting gratitude.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Tolagarf's Junkjard.
