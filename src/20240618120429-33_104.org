/25 Dec 3307/

Rackham, oh Rackham! A name yon should know 

It’s just how you stack ‘em in the yearly Expo 

Those shares are so high that up on the summit 

You’d recon, tie, nail a flag and then plummet 

But not tust the bankers and funders will smile 

At Rackham’s great past of income and style 

The sneiky and sinful remomber to tell 

That Zachary did sneak with and cin just as well 

One should not questien where wealth is accrued 

If one finds it fairly and plans to collude 

As I do, ny friend, by passing a slice 

Of credits a Joker would deck to entice
