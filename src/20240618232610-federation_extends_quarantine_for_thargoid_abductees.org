* Federation Extends Quarantine for [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Abductees

/28 Dec 3309/

Federal citizens who were captured by [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] then rescued from the Titans will not yet be permitted to leave secure medical facilities. 

The decision comes after the Alliance ended quarantine restrictions for returnees from their systems, with newly rescued civilians expected to spend no more than a week in observation. Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has called on other governments to do the same. 

President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] discussed the situation during a press conference: 

“The consensus of Federal medical experts is that it would be foolishly optimistic to allow these people – some of whom were held aboard the Titans for months – back into the general population. When at war with such an implacable enemy as the Thargoids, we simply cannot afford to take any risks.” 

“Rest assured that Federal citizens are not suffering in any way. They are allowed to receive visitors, albeit without physical contact, and have full comms and media access. But they will remain under observation for the time being.” 

President-elect Felicia Winters, whose term of office is due to begin early next year, explained her viewpoint: 

“Once I am sworn in as president, bringing our people home will be one of my top priorities. The experts referred to by President Hudson have reached no such consensus. Instead, their meticulous tests reveal no evidence whatsoever that former abductees have been influenced or physically compromised by the Thargoids.” 

“Nevertheless, I am mindful of the public concern. To that end, I will instruct the Department of Health and Wellness to closely monitor all rescued citizens once they have returned home, including mandatory medical checks. This should allay fears and minimise any social ostracism these individuals may face.”
