A fearsome [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]]. She was active in the mid-3200's.

She was known for a series of daring raids between 3253-3261, with her
gang often overpowering significantly larger forces to steal cargo
from trade convoys in and around [[id:bb2b96a9-f27a-4530-a8f5-2a65a422146a][Frenis]]. Her most significant rivals
belonged to the [[id:79fe1167-5195-406f-b1a1-945de995eda2][Candira]] gang, and firefights between the two groups
were common. Morrigan was last sighted in 3265, and it is believed she
died in action around this time.
