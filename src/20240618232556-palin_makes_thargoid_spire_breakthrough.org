* Palin Makes Thargoid Spire Breakthrough

/10 Nov 3309/

Analysis of objects and refinery compounds obtained from Thargoid spire sites has revealed a crucial connection to the Titans. 

The announcement was made by Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]], who has been receiving deliveries of these materials from Pilots’ Federation members: 

“Genetic commonalities between the spire compounds and Titan hull fragments have now been verified. My research suggests these surface sites have been established to harvest resources which sustain the Thargoid motherships in some way. It may be that their supplies of some vital enzymes or fuels are running low, after months of being deployed away from their home worlds.” 

“To capitalise on this newfound understanding, my team has synthesised a biological contaminant based on the chemical composition of the samples. Introducing this to a spire’s processing chain can only help our efforts to disrupt their invasion plans.” 

Dr Maximo Fonseca, the Alliance’s scientific liaison to Aegis, commented: 

“It is important to note that Professor Palin’s work is still in the experimental phase, necessitating further testing. Large quantities of the contaminant will need to be transported to all known spires. This will be a highly dangerous mission, as the sites are aggressively patrolled by Thargoid drones and vessels.” 

Aegis has expressed gratitude to everyone who provided samples from the Titans and Thargoid spire sites to Professor Palin in the Arque system. A special notice was published honouring those pilots who delivered the first and the highest number of items:
