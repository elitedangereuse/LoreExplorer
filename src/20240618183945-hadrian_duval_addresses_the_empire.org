* [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] Addresses the Empire

/13 Dec 3304/

[[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]], the long-lost grandson of Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]], has broadcast a message to the Empire: 

“I am no wealthy senator from an entitled family, but someone who has lived an ordinary life. Someone who understands the hardships faced by many Imperial citizens.” 

“As Hadrian Jansen, I was a poor child with no family other than my father. Together we scraped a living as independent traders. He never spoke of his past – not even when he died two years ago. That was when I inherited his ship and became a Commander myself.” 

“When Imperator Mordanticus informed me of my heritage, I knew I had to accept my identity as a Duval. I’ve seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed.” 

“I ask you to honour the legacy of the Duval bloodline. With Nova Imperium, let’s save the Empire we love.”
