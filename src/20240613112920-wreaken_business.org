* 0218  Wreaken Business
[[id:bb8ac014-a3ac-4564-9c3a-7aaff6536d59][Zearla]]

[[id:d83dcf95-2757-4708-8988-d48f2b345932][Wreaken]] facilities exist on many worlds, but their contracts are
primarily with the Federation, Independent and Alliance
systems. Mining stations extract natural resources and transport them
to vast industrial refineries, or with the larger deposits, refine
them on site. The company is aggressive in its acquisitions as it
strives to maintain its position in the face of direct competition
from Mastopolos Mining Incorporated.

The recent discoveries of [[id:d10c0435-4bc8-42ac-bea6-228d2f02604c][Tantalum]] in several systems, including
[[id:35ef7825-95ca-418d-9cc2-9e7934b351c9][Tiliala]] during the last century have led to several new contracts for
Wreaken. Massive mining operations have been oragnised in the system
during the last decade as jurisdictional wrangling between the
Federation and the Empire continues. The Corporation hold contracts
with both sides in the system and can mine the ore without
prejudice. Who the ore is supplied to afterwards, remains a problem.
