* President Kincaid Impeached

/13 Jun 3305/

President [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]] has been removed from office after a majority vote in the Alliance Assembly, following charges of treason, murder and corruption. The date of his trial is expected to be confirmed soon. 

Alliance Interpol confirmed that Kincaid was detained while attempting to flee his personal estate on Zaonce. A firefight broke out between Interpol agents and emissaries from the Office of the Alliance President, acting as Kincaid’s personal bodyguards. Several fatalities were later confirmed. 

A number of influential corporate and political figures who supported Kincaid’s conspiracy to gain executive control of the Alliance have also been arrested, including a senior director at the [[id:e9439fe0-8637-4330-b5fd-b4f1643cf472][Bank of Zaonce]].  

Prosecutions are expected to rely heavily on the recent testimony of Admiral [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Frederick Yamamoto]] and a detailed report provided by the Wallglass Investigations Agency.  

[[id:e9a91ed4-acc1-4e93-9dee-b0aa03fd2ce9][Tashmira Silva]], who privately commissioned the report, told the media: 

“I am satisfied that Kincaid will at last face justice for his crimes, including my sister’s murder. Fazia championed fairness, and succeeded as an entrepreneur by believing in others, she would be pleased to know that the Alliance has been purged of such a corrupt presence.”
