* ACT Gathers Intelligence on the NMLA

/22 Mar 3307/

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT), formed by all three superpowers to combat the NMLA, has launched its investigation. 

The organisation has been working closely with Alliance Interpol, the Imperial Internal Security Service and the Federal Intelligence Agency to collate data on the terrorist strikes against nine starports. 

Captain Niamh Seutonia, one of ACT’s joint leaders, told the media: 

“Initial forensic results from the targeted stations suggest the use of a more compact bomb design than in previous attacks, possibly constructed on-site. Worryingly, the NMLA’s new generation of weapons seem to be easier to transport and conceal.” 

“The good news is that a comparison of reports has revealed one very promising lead. I will personally take a team to follow this up, and we’re hoping for an early breakthrough.” 

Inspector Mara Klatt also provided a brief progress report: 

“Our working theory is that the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] employs an undetectable interstellar communications system to coordinate its attacks. A similar [[id:b58b26bb-8465-42a9-896c-4c0e97d20444][dark-comms]] network was used by the League of Reparation before we decrypted it, but this version is evidently more sophisticated. We are liaising with local security services to gather evidence.”
