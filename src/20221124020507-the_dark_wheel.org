   Oh, they're out there alright. I've never met them, but _I know they're out there_.
   Think about how well known the stories are. Now think about
   how easy it would be for some two-bit band of hucksters to pass
   themselves off as the Dark Wheel and start trading on their
   reputation. Doesn't happen, does it? Not for long, anyway. Whenever
   someone tries to usurp the Dark Wheel name, sooner or later they get
   quietly shut down. And that's how I know.

The Dark Wheel is the name given to a legendary group of adventurers,
explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters, the existence of which
is so lacking in corroborative evidence that it is generally
considered a myth. The group is often mentioned in connection with the
equally unsubstantiated '[[id:a2bd8247-2daf-4bd9-b6da-667ff707b0a2][Raxxla]]'.

Those who believe in the existence of the Dark Wheel consider it to be
a continuous and clandestine organisation, operating since the very
earliest days of interstellar travel. According to the lore, only a
handful of the bravest and most competent pilots of each generation
are honoured with an invitation to join the group. It is futile to
attempt to contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however -
it is always they who initiate contact, initially in disguise,
revealing their true identity only once a suitable [[id:c951fc2c-63cb-4884-81d6-b38c62afada6][test]] of courage and
[[id:02a9c750-ffc3-4368-a7f2-92a925b715e9][skill]] has been discreetly administered, and passed.

Opposing theories assert that new members are selected on the basis of
lineage, with existing members covertly training their children and
revealing the fact of their membership only when the child is
ready. Conversely, some members are believed to go to great lengths to
prevent their children from ever becoming involved, since the group's
[[id:6ad7e1e4-4fb0-4cbf-b9a1-771afa67ed0b][secrets]] are dangerous.

According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert [[id:26fd3b75-9402-4192-ad70-3889de39c7c8][Lyta Crane]], a conspiracy
theorist and 'people's journalist' who has painstakingly assembled an
archive of relevant data, the original group was based in a [[id:428a6236-9808-4fbe-a738-5a62d24f89ad][disused
starport]] orbiting the [[id:4c5f7870-8dfd-463f-aadf-aa43ddeaeaa8][eighth]] [[id:e998c95c-a76f-4312-a8c2-3a8706232ae9][moon]] of an unnamed [[id:c06b99eb-1957-4432-ac68-8477488428a1][gas giant]]. The station
was [[id:149464fc-2fa5-4413-acb4-f44cb585f171][toroid]], hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output so
as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.

Crane believes that this starport is still in use, and is the only
means whereby the genuine Dark Wheel can verify its identity; new
inductees can examine the records and artefacts preserved there, and
thus satisfy themselves that the group has indeed been operating for
centuries. No such starport has ever been found, however, and rival
experts have accused Crane of forging her evidence in order to
maintain the revenue from her billions of followers.

Over the years, many people have claimed to be members of the Dark
Wheel, to have identified some or all of the group's members, or to
have discovered the group's location, but the contradictory nature of
these claims suggests that most of them, if not all, are untrue.

In 3300, a group identifying itself as the Dark Wheel emerged in the
Shinrarta Dezhra system, which is not accessible to pilots of lower
than [[id:088cf15e-3c00-4522-8c15-aa4c8b30ea8c][Elite rank]]. It is not apparent if the group is a legitimate
descendant of the original Dark Wheel, a reconstruction, or merely an
opportunistic imitator.
