* Sirius Defends Alliance Territory

/13 Apr 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Sirius Corporation megaships will soon arrive in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas to provide anti-xeno support. 

The three vessels are intended as a demonstration of Sirius Corporation’s military capabilities, prior to the strategic defence pact being ratified by [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] Assembly. 

A public statement was provided by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] Council of Admirals: 

“The Coalsack Nebula and Witch Head Nebula regions are where Alliance interests are most at risk from [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] attack. From tomorrow, our megaships will serve as bases from which anti-xeno operations can be conducted.” 

“All ships in the area are invited to make use of the Song of Mecchi in the Coalsack Sector Vu-O B6-6 system, the Kandula's Truth in the Siniang system, and the Li Chyou Winds in the Onoros system.” 

“As a further gesture of our dedication to protecting the Alliance, these megaships will offer a unique pre-engineered heat sink module. We trust that this will prove especially useful to those brave pilots who face the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] in combat.”
