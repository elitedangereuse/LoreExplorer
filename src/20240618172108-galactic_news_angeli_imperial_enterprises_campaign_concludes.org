* Galactic News: Angeli Imperial Enterprises Campaign Concludes

/22 Dec 3303/

A spokesperson for Angeli Imperial Enterprises has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Potagos Port, the organisationâ€™s base of operations. The materials will be used to build a Dionysus-class Agricultural Vessel in support of ongoing resource-extraction operations in the Pleiades. 

Angeli Imperial Enterprises has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Potagos Port in the Wangal system.
