* Scientist's Appeal Successful

/23 Dec 3301/

Last week, Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] issued a request for evacuation shelters with which to establish a new research outpost on Maia b1ba in the Maia system. Today, Professor Palin announced that the request had been positively received by the galactic community, and that he and his team were now in a position to start work on their new base of operations. 

"Given the strong correlation between the presence of Unknown Artefacts and the mechanical issues currently affecting starports, it's of the utmost importance that we continue our research at a remove from the civilian population," said Professor Palin. "This new outpost will allow us to do exactly that, and it couldn't have been achieved without the support of the public." 

Professor Palin said he hoped the new station would be up and running within a week.
