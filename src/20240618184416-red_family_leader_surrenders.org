* [[id:792ffce8-85dc-4147-8ea3-8e5feb26ba94][Red Family]] Leader Surrenders

/29 Jun 3305/

Jan Sandoval, a known founder of the infamous [[id:792ffce8-85dc-4147-8ea3-8e5feb26ba94][Red Family]] drug cartel, has unexpectedly handed herself in to the Federal Intelligence Agency. 

Executive Agent Viola Trask gave a summary of this development: 

“It’s not unheard of for criminals to present themselves at FIA headquarters in Olympus Village, but Sandoval is by far the most notorious individual to do so.” 

“Sandoval has stated that she is willing to testify against all prominent members of the cartel, an action that would effectively dismantle it. She has been placed in protective custody, and I will be personally handling her case.”  

The [[id:792ffce8-85dc-4147-8ea3-8e5feb26ba94][Red Family]] is a well-established syndicate that supplies illegal narcotics across multiple systems. Within its hierarchy, Sandoval is believed to be second only to kingpin Oberon Church, who is among the most wanted criminals in the Federation.
