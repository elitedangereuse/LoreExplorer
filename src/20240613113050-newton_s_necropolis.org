[[id:df8f9af7-7b3b-4a2f-bd33-f9403ce53596][Phroi Bluae IR-W f1-1530]]

[[id:f176c68d-cc7a-4db2-8305-81f6771c7e9f][Distant Worlds II]] was an ambitious five-month expedition to the far
outer rim. It launched from the [[id:4ccdf1db-68db-4935-8cac-b6d23e01d78d][Pallaeni]] system in January 3305 and
reached its final destination of [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]] in May 3305. The purpose
of the expedition was to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, and to
construct a starport at [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]]. This planet was discovered
during the [[id:dbb9956e-5ae2-4c27-94f7-670f0a4719f9][Distant Worlds]] mapping event, and is notable for its
unusually high surface gravity.
