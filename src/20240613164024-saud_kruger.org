To independent pilots, Saud Kruger is best known for luxurious passenger
liners such as the Beluga, Dolphin and Orca, although the company also
runs a tourism branch under the Astrogator brand.

Saud Kruger started life as a yacht manufacturer in Bedaho, although the
narrowness of the market curtailed the company's growth. When company
director [[id:39e42b99-ece9-4a2f-a859-858f2887e5f4][Stanislav Kruger]] purchased the struggling Astrogator touring
company in 3270, he gave Saud Kruger a foothold in multiple star
systems. Kruger then refurbished the Astrogator fleet and revamped the
somewhat stale tour itinerary to give it a more adventurous,
thrill-seeking flavour, which proved highly successful.

Goldskin leather, sourced exclusively from the planet Home in the Bedaho
system, has been used in the interiors of Saud Kruger ships for years,
and is part of the company's distinctive aesthetic. Saud Kruger has the
exclusive right to produce real goldskin, which comes embedded with
coded nanoparticles that act as guarantors of authenticity.

Saud Kruger also competes in the field of interstellar mapping and
deep-space exploration, and likes to emphasise the danger and glamour of
exploring. The company's critics claim this approach risks transforming
the vitally important field of space exploration into a pastime for the
idle rich, thus alienating the many freelancers on whose hard work the
discipline depends.
