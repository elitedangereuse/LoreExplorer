* Empire Accused of Power Grab in Federation's Heart

/09 Jan 3311/

Imperial agents have been charged with attempting to seize political
influence deep in Federal territory following the [[id:b0eb6430-5359-4c32-8593-48a8d07f6d72][Battle of Sol]].

With the aftermath of the Thargoid Invasion still causing upheaval
across populated space, there has been a marked effort by many
factions to establish themselves in systems impacted by [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]'s
assault in December.

[[id:e660f840-caed-45ef-985e-f75170cf9ca8][Sofia Trevino]] wrote a summary for the [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][Federal Times]]: 

“In recent weeks there has been turmoil in [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]], as political,
corporate and military interests come to terms with the impact of
Titan Cocijo's arrival – not to mention the civilian cost, with
billions of refugees still displaced in surrounding systems.”

“But an unexpected element has emerged, with ports and outposts
reporting a significant increase in positive Imperial sentiment. This
has been tied to Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] in particular, currently
enjoying a good reputation among non-Imperial populations due to her
work as a delegate to Aegis and a champion of humanitarian causes for
those impacted by the xeno war.”

“Shadow-President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]] has stamped down on this flourishing
popularity and was described as ‘outraged' by the notion of Imperial
influence in the heart of the Federation. Republican media outlets,
counteragents and even the [[id:ea0acf7b-8942-4f0c-a78e-18b1e0a3fd8a][Proactive Detection Bureau]] were deployed to
quell the initial unrest.”

Princess Aisling has denied any involvement in the growth of Imperial
support, but did imply that Federal populations ‘should not be spurned
for the consideration of new ideas'.

It has been noted that a core of Aisling's supporters remain active in
[[id:eb84f0de-8dc5-4577-8e73-ea4eb1d2e4d5][Barnard's Star]], which no doubt concerns the Federal government.
