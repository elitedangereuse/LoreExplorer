* Patreus Slave Sale Ends

/16 Feb 3301/

It's been an interesting week for the people of [[id:c0ca77c2-1994-4f1c-9f14-b839171da15a][Durius]] as they continue to undergo assimilation into the greater Imperial fold.  

As part of that process, the management team in charge of [[id:c0ca77c2-1994-4f1c-9f14-b839171da15a][Durius]] were able to offer debt relief retraining to 12070 newly minted citizens. As a result, 12070 Imperial Slaves found themselves exported from Durius to other parts of the Empire over the last week. A move that was partly facilitated through a newly formed business arrangement between Senator Patreus and Senator Torval.  

Senator Patreus has said of this: 

“I am glad the remaining citizens of [[id:c0ca77c2-1994-4f1c-9f14-b839171da15a][Durius]] have freely entered the honourable Imperial tradition and agreed to repay their share of the debt by voluntarily becoming Imperial Slaves until their debts are fully repaid. I wish them well.” 

Given the fact that the remaining citizenry are in good financial standing, the temporary sale of Imperial Slaves from [[id:c0ca77c2-1994-4f1c-9f14-b839171da15a][Durius]] has now come to an end.
