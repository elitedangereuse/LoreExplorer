* Community Goal: Conspiracy Theorist Appeals for Cartographic Data

/29 FEB 3302/

Notorious conspiracy theorist [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]] has issued an appeal
for cartographic data with which to substantiate an extraordinary
claim. According to a recent press statement, Bentonio has unearthed
ancient records that prove the 29th of February 3302, which appears on
all galactic calendars, should not exist. He has convinced [[id:897c2aeb-49d0-4822-a060-62679585624b][Kruger 60
Free]] to fund the one-day appeal, believing that the cartographic data
will prove him correct.

Bentonio elaborated on his theory at a press conference: 

"We're not just talking about computers shutting down or ship systems
failing. We're talking about the end of life as we know it! We're
talking about the very fabric of space-time collapsing in on itself,
and the entire universe coming to an end!"

Despite Bentonio having been widely derided as a tin foil hat-wearing
crackpot, it's likely that the financial incentives he is offering
will earn him some support. Pilots who want to contribute to the
initiative are invited to deliver cartographic data to Jones Estate in
the [[id:6db801f4-9e17-46a2-8412-827e3064c370][Groombridge 34]] system on the 29th of February 3302.
