* Week in Review

/15 Sep 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

An anonymous source has revealed that [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], owner of technology company [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]], was previously investigated by the [[id:0ba9accc-93ad-45a0-a771-e26daa59e58f][Federal Security Service]]. The source disclosed that Hurd accepted financial contributions from individuals connected to criminal networks when establishing his company. In the wake of the news, a number of Herculean Machines’ corporate investors have withdrawn their support. 

The candidates in the Alliance presidential election have been announced: Fazia Silva, a successful entrepreneur from the Vamm system, and Elijah Beck, an experienced politician from Leesti. It is understood that all three candidates – Kincaid, Silva and Beck – are roughly equal in terms of popular support. 

Meanwhile, Juanita Bishop has called on Federal Congress to make Thargoid worship a capital crime, and for all members of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult to be executed. Some Federal congressmen have aligned with Mrs Bishop, eager to be seen as ‘tough on Thargoids’, but others have criticised her for her inhumane rhetoric. 

In other news, [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] has revealed more about the XG Project, which produced the recently released XG fighters. In an interview, the engineer revealed that he had been trying to combine human and Guardian technology since the first Guardian ruins were discovered. He closed the interview by expressing hope that the XG Project was the start of a new era of technological development. 

The Libertas Cooperative has announced plans to construct a manatee farm on behalf of food supplier [[id:1e48fa56-b4c2-4940-924c-7bd79225dbaa][Munshin Manatee Meat]]. This will take the form of a megaship, where the creatures will be bred, processed and prepared for distribution. To facilitate construction of the manatee farm, the Libertas Cooperative has placed an open order for various commodities. 

Finally, the Alioth Independents have announced that their appeal for exotic food and drink has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. Huge quantities of Esuseku Caviar, Ceremonial Heike Tea and Live Hecate Sea Worms were delivered to Smith Landing over the past week, which will now be used to host a special gala event. 

And those are the main stories this week.
