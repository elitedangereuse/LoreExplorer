* [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] Dominates Expo

/05 Oct 3304/

Technology journalist [[id:81ba02cb-f405-4079-9207-63afc71263df][Harlow Nassry]] has published a full account of the [[id:9d064da0-7be3-4c7b-99ad-0edd1585d4ca][Rackham Ultratech Expo]], which took place on Wednesday 3rd October. 

“All eyes were on [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] and [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], whose competing designs for personal computers have created a real buzz. Following lavish presentations from rival CEOs [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]] and [[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]], prototypes of the Duradrive and Torc were given to attendees.” 

“Unfortunately for [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], the Torc’s holographic systems did not work as planned. Most users were surrounded by an incomprehensible aura of colours and images that, in some cases, brought on nausea. The Duradrive, by contrast, functioned perfectly.” 

“The highlight of the expo came when Zachary Rackham tested a Duradrive by jumping on it, before using it to contact his chief accountant and authorise preliminary funding for the device. He told the crowd, ‘I could have done with one of these back in my spacefaring days!’” 

“It’s clear that the support given to [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] by the galactic community has allowed them to deliver a superior product – one we can expect to see on the market soon.”
