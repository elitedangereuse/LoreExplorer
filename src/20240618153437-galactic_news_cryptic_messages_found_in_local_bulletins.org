* Galactic News: Cryptic Messages Found in Local Bulletins

/29 Jan 3302/

A number of pilots have reported cryptic finding messages in starports' news feeds. The origin of the messages is not clear, but they share certain characteristics, including references to apparent criminal activity, and in some cases coordinates. Often the messages are partially corrupted, suggesting they were originally hidden in the news feeds in an encoded form. Precisely why the messages have started surfacing in the public news channel is unclear. 

Are these messages genuine criminal communiqu√©s, or merely a creative hoax? We leave you to decide.
