* Zosi Major Corporation Issues Request

/10 Nov 3302/

The Zosi Major Corporation, an independent organisation based in the Zosi system, has placed an open order for thermic alloys, chemical manipulators and industrial firmware. According to the organisation's spokesperson, the resources will be used in an unspecified research and development project. 

Dr Arkady Cole, the organisation's chief research scientist, released the following statement: 

"We want the resources, yes? Very useful to us. Process is simple. Deliver the resources and be paid. Yes." 

Despite the opaque nature of the request, it is likely the generous reimbursements offered by the Zosi Major Corporation will ensure its orders are met. Participating pilots have been instructed to deliver the requested commodities to Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system. 

The campaign begins on the 10th of November and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
