* 0121 Mic Turner History
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

Born in 3205, [[id:c46f5348-be85-4d06-bf04-12a9b812d0ad][Mic Turner]] grew up in [[id:cc0edb9e-01ea-4de0-85c3-74bb5b5196df][Jones Colony]] in the [[id:bb5887ea-0ed7-4410-9a7e-814107ea29eb][Essafa]]
system. After graduating with honours from the civilian Pilots school,
he moved to [[id:47df3d18-6cdd-443d-baae-0e3af142a089][New California]] in Alioth, just before the rebellion
started.

In 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying New California
attempted to raise their prices again, the citizens revolted, taking
over the ships berthed in the space station and riding out to the gas
mining station to assault the corporate workers. Federal and Imperial
forces arrived within days, but fighters from Alioth and several
neighbouring independent systems joined forces to repel them.

Turner's [[id:6a2dc1b0-f13c-4595-b844-8f79d5253a61][pilot]] skills saw him amongst the first to fly out to the
orbital platforms and he won a great deal of respect from his peers
for his efforts. It was here the met [[id:932c4921-da8d-4652-ab70-a19bdd49a8a3][Meredith Argent]], a scientiest who
led one of the Caker cells on the gas platforms and was direct
descendant of [[id:c921a096-a8b0-4ebd-acce-c69bbd5ae4e8][Walter Argent]], a wealthy industrial from [[id:37a0d8e6-0c42-4e05-8d92-a4b75b89308b][Ayethi]] in the
the 27th century. Argent and Turner were to become partners for life.
