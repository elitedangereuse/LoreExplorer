* Starport Repair Initiative Announced

/01 Jun 3304/

Following Thargoid strikes on the fringes of the core systems, a new initiative to restore damaged starports has been announced. 

Chief administrator [[id:fa943255-7f7c-4ac5-b8ac-86c78b156512][Carter Armstrong]] spoke on behalf of [[id:79f218d0-1350-4c43-95f3-0869621dd59a][Aegis Core]], which is coordinating the campaign: 

“We’ve set up this fund to reassure citizens that normality will continue, no matter what. I would like to appeal to the galactic community to restore services in the core systems to their previously high standard.” 

An open order has been placed for construction materials, which will be shipped to the affected starports and used to make repairs. Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to [[id:982f62a4-4f8a-44d3-a16e-0b87cde3327f][Dantec Enterprise]] in the [[id:092e7139-1d8c-45d1-89ce-615326e10853][Socho]] system. 

The campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
