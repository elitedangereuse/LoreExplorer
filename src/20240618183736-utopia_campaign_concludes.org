* Utopia Campaign Concludes

/11 May 3304/

The [[id:058a658d-e1ce-4364-a92b-b9607495c73f][Utopia]] campaign to construct a military installation in its home
system has now concluded. Many traders delivered a huge quantity of
construction material to [[id:958d3b04-bbb5-4d7e-b0f0-0208abfea93c][Bobko City]], which will be used to build
defences for the [[id:83b3ed4c-f0b1-4311-a4df-34bdfa742126][Sim-Archive]]. Other independent pilots protected the
operation by eliminating pirate vessels.

[[id:058a658d-e1ce-4364-a92b-b9607495c73f][Utopia]]’s spokesperson, Dr [[id:78f7348c-44af-40bf-8f60-ff0e4d3425d0][Leigh Constantinides]], expressed her
gratitude:

“On behalf of Utopia, I would like to thank everyone who worked so
hard to support this project. We hope that this will safeguard the
[[id:83b3ed4c-f0b1-4311-a4df-34bdfa742126][Sim-Archive]] for the benefit of all our descendants.”

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards
from Bobko City in the Narri system.
