* Investor Sets Sights on [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]]

/31 Jan 3305/

Billionaire investor Lexi October has announced plans to save technology company [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] from bankruptcy: 

“Although [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]]’s Torc design proved to be impractical, I feel that a company with such imagination and expertise deserves another chance to succeed. So I have decided to fund a commodity drive to get Supratech back on its feet.” 

“I have invited the People's Rakapila Progressive Party to organise shipments of Computer components, Auto-fabricators and Hardware diagnostic sensors, which will enable [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] to resume its innovative work.” 

Deliveries should be made to Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system. To protect traders, the People's Rakapila Progressive Party has placed a kill order on all wanted ships in the system. 

The initiative begins on the 31st of January 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
