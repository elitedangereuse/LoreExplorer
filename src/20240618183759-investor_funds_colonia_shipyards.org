* Investor Funds [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Shipyards

/20 Jun 3304/

Renowned billionaire [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]], owner of [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]], has made a sizeable charitable donation to build new shipyards in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region. 

Mr Rackham, known in some circles as ‘Calico Zack’, made this statement: 

“If there’s one thing I remember from flying around the galaxy in a second-hand Sidewinder with a leaky life-support module and only fifty credits in my pocket, it’s the thrill of exploration. And [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] is the embodiment of that spirit, the farthest-flung outpost of civilisation.” 

“That’s why I want to support it by funding the development of new shipyards. Every planetary port in the region, bar [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Hub, will soon be able to offer pilots the support services they need. It’s my way of celebrating a youth filled with poverty and danger, by giving a boost to the next generation of explorers.” 

[[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]], a financial journalist for [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]], also published a statement: 

“Obviously this is tremendous news for [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] and all those operating within the region. The timing of Rackham’s donation is curious, however, coming as it does shortly before a company-wide audit. Having such a colossal sum placed beyond the reach of tax officials will certainly help that old pirate – and his crew of accountants – sleep better at night.”
