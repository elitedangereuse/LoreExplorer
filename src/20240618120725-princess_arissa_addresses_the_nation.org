* Princess Arissa Addresses the Nation

/02 Apr 3301/

In what can only be seen as a result of the attack on her alleged father, Princess [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] has today broken her long silence in an address to the nation on the steps of the Imperial Palace. 

“Honoured citizens of the Empire, my Imperial brothers and sisters, I come before you today not as a Princess or as a Senator, but as a concerned daughter of this nation.” 

“In our father’s long absence, certain undesirable elements have sought to usurp the right and just laws which govern our civilisation. Through their dishonourable actions they seek to unravel the delicate threads that bind us together as a great and unified society.” 

“The house of Duval will not allow the madness of the few to undo everything that we have struggled so long to achieve. I swear to you, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the Emperor’s protection will stand. You will not live in fear of hunger, of sickness, of weakness or shame.” 

“Enemies of the Imperial court beware. This is your one warning. You will not get another.”
