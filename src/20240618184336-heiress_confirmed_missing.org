* Heiress Confirmed Missing

/15 Feb 3305/

The Ambrose Foundation has confirmed that Lady Talitha Ambrose is missing, and that all of its assets have been lost. 

Baroness Oksana Ambrose, head of the institution, told the media: 

“Everything we own has been transferred from our accounts to who knows where. Emergency funds are being used to settle debts and pay staff, but essentially the Ambrose Foundation is ruined.” 

“I can only assume that vicious criminals have kidnapped Lady Talitha and tortured her into surrendering her inheritance.” 

“I have used the last of our reserves to hire the Wallglass Investigations Agency. I pray that they can locate and rescue my beloved daughter.”
