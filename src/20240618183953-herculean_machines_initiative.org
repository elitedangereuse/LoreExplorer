* [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] Initiative

/27 Dec 3304/

The Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal computers from manufacturer [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]. 

[[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], the company’s CEO, made this announcement: 

“It’s a testament to the Duradrive’s reliability that the Federal Navy wants to make it standard issue, and we are proud to supply them.” 

“Fulfilling this order on time requires additional materials, however, so we urgently need deliveries of consumer technology, hardware diagnostic sensors and computer components to Boltzmann Hub in the Blatrimpe system.” 

“The campaign is being coordinated by our partner, the Blatrimpe Allied Co Commodities, which has placed a kill order on all wanted ships to keep traders safe. I haven’t ruled out the possibility that our rivals might recruit agitators to disrupt this operation – who knows what [[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]] is up to these days?” 

The initiative begins on the 27th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
