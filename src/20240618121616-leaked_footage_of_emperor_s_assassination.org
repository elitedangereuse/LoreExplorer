* Leaked Footage of Emperor’s Assassination

/09 Aug 3301/

Leaked Footage of Emperor’s Assassination 
 
In a move sending shockwaves of revulsion throughout the Empire, an independent newsfeed, Russell Networks, based in the Tulill system, has broadcast what is claimed to be a holographic recording of the assassination of Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]]. 

Imperial networks are refusing to show the footage and all levels of imperial society are outraged at this insult to the Emperor’s memory. The recording’s authenticity hasn’t been confirmed, but it does clearly show someone who looks like Brendan Paul Darius attacking the Emperor. As the Emperor passes by Senator Patreus’ entourage Darius is seen to lunge from the group. He then stabs the Emperor several times with a blade and inflicting severe facial injuries until being taken down by the nearest guards. In it, others in Patreus’s entourage, including Senator Patreus himself, appear to move to try to stop the attacker, and do appear to be genuinely surprised and shocked. 

Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] condemned the broadcast in a statement and refused to comment on its veracity.
