* Guardian Deliveries Accelerate Anti-Titan Project

/25 Jan 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Shipments of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics have boosted hopes of developing a weapon against the Thargoid Titans. 

The Aegis-led initiative gathered supplies of the crystalline relics left behind by the Guardian species, as well as the Unclassified relics that result when they interface with Thargoid surface sites. 

These were requested to support a project based on new theories expounded by the engineer Ram Tah, considered the leading expert on Guardian history and technology. 

Aden Tanner, who works as an anti-xeno strategist for Aegis, made a brief comment to Vox Galactica: 

“As always, we’re grateful to every pilot who took part to support Aegis. I don’t mind sharing that Ram Tah is delighted, and is currently refining his theory with the aid of specialists from all three superpowers.” 

“We hope to reveal more details very soon, but at this point it’s worth managing expectations around the proposed anti-Titan weapon. It remains true that our existing armaments are incapable of inflicting damage on Thargoid motherships. But if Ram Tah is correct, we may be able to reveal certain vulnerabilities by exploiting a newly discovered aspect of Guardian technology.” 

A spokesperson from Aegis also revealed that Professor Palin is supporting Ram Tah’s research, stating: “The most prominent engineers of our age are once again working together to defend humanity against the Thargoid threat.” 

Aegis has confirmed that all participants in the delivery campaign can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.
