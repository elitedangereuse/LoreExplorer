* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation Announces New Programme

/15 Oct 3301/

Earlier this year, the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation expanded into the systems of HIP 8396, Almagest, [[id:aa43803c-e60c-45bf-ab48-49a139931c68][Sothis]], Ceos, and Robigo. At the time, a number of economists predicted that these systems would witness dramatic change after being brought under Sirius Corp. control, but in fact the affected systems have remained much the same, with citizens reporting little difference to their everyday lives. 

It seems, however, that the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation might simply have been biding its time. In a statement released today, [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]], the CEO of the Sirius Corp., announced ambitious plans to revitalise his company's new holdings: 

"Over the coming weeks, the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation will subsidize a number of initiatives designed to revive the social and economic health of our new territories. These initiatives, which will rely heavily on support from independent contractors and pilots, will reinvigorate the economies of the affected systems, and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for our compatriots." 

Roberta Unwin, an economist who regularly contributes to the Money Matters news feed, commented on the announcement: 

"Wealthy organisations often expand into new areas without any immediate plans in mind. Sometimes it's because they think the area will become profitable â€“ other times it's done to undercut a rival. It's called speculative expansion. It's actually rather common, although it usually takes place on a much smaller scale." 

It appears the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp. is eager to get started. The first of its initiatives is due to begin today, with the company appealing to independent pilots to deliver osmium to the HIP 8396 system, and promising to reward participants generously.
