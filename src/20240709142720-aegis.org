* Aegis
A scientific-military organisation founded in 3303, Aegis was
established in a collaboration between the Alliance, Empire and
Federation to coordinate research into the Thargoids and develop
technologies with which to counter their aggression. Headquartered in
the Sol and Delphi systems, it is overseen by an executive board, with
scientific and military branches led by Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] and
former Federal admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], respectively. Although the
organisation was initially focused on research, its remit has since been
widened to encompass defence.

With access to a vast pool of resources, Aegis is constantly growing. In
addition to a fleet encompassing dozens of megaships, the organisation
also operates a large number of laboratories and orbital outposts.

Aegis has collaborated with external parties on a number of occasions,
including the engineers [[id:cb71ba02-e47b-4feb-a421-b1f2ecdce6f3][Liz Ryder]], [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] and [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]. With Ryder
and Palin, Aegis developed a suite of weapons specifically calibrated to
damage Thargoid vessels, denoting its first foray into the area of
defence. It worked with ship manufacturer [[id:a35836b6-243b-45eb-9d79-faae08802d0c][Faulcon deLacy]] to produce an
anti-Thargoid version of the [[id:9060c4b1-7b47-4b16-8ac4-0e70a8132ea4][Taipan]] fighter, and then partnered with Ram
Tah in an effort to gain further insights into Thargoid behaviour.

Towards the end of 3303 Aegis expanded its research division,
establishing 25 laboratories at starports throughout human-occupied
space. Research efforts focused on the Thargoids' transmission and
storage of information, and the categorisation of geographical data --
work that would pave the way for later discoveries about Thargoid
territorialism. But no sooner had work begun then the laboratories came
under attack from Thargoid ships.

While the attacks were initially thought to be random, it was later
determined that they represented a deliberate attempt to prevent Aegis
from analysing Thargoid materials. An unprecedented development, the
attacks shed new light on the Thargoids' agenda and capacity for
strategic reasoning.

In 3304, Aegis was forced to relocate its administrative headquarters
from the Socho system to Sol when a criminal organisation, the Socho
Gold Raiders, engineered a hostile takeover of the system. The attack
illustrated the need for greater protection from human threats; Federal
President Zachary Hudson, in a moment of characteristic frankness,
equated aggression against Aegis with treason against humanity, saying
"The weakening of our defences cannot be tolerated."

Following the attack, Aegis established [[id:646f54ce-5f75-49a2-b3d2-2fb12e9580c7][The Sentinel]], a military
installation, in the [[id:7e99a467-6e3d-418e-8b10-72cf3660efa6][Pleiades Nebula]]. While Aegis officials insisted
that The Sentinel would allow the organisation to "continue our fight
against the Thargoids unhindered by external forces", critics opined
that the organisation's growing military focus was cause for concern. In
3305, the organisation entered into a partnership with Ram Tah to
manufacture [[id:f57cff55-3348-45ea-b76f-d0eaa3c68165][Guardian]]-inspired technology, including Ram Tah's XG
fighters.

Despite its apolitical stance, Aegis has come under scrutiny from
certain sectors of the galactic community, who insist it cannot be
trusted. Criticism has focused on the parallels between Aegis and the
Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm ([[id:39a31dd8-3750-4507-90b7-b649d0eeecef][INRA]]) -- a defunct Federal-Imperial
initiative established in 3125 during the first human-Thargoid conflict
-- with detractors insisting that Aegis is guilty of the same unethical
and unregulated activity conducted by the INRA. But while Aegis shares
the same purpose as its forebear, there is scant evidence of
unscrupulous conduct.
