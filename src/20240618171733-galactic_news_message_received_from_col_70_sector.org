* Galactic News: Message Received from Col 70 Sector

/08 Apr 3303/

A [[id:fc080297-079e-4e48-9d40-8c87211d9142][weak signal]] from the [[id:c8fe6fa0-8b82-4887-be3e-13422ca888a6][Col 70 Sector]] has been detected by [[id:f804dd3c-98ca-4aec-83be-3d8551320989][listening posts]] in both Federal and Imperial space. 

The message is incomplete, but it appears to pertain to some kind of
rally point. Meanwhile, Federal and Imperial intelligence services
have confirmed that thousands of [[id:f1b7fa19-c7af-489d-a955-7c90fee79e9a][covert]] and [[id:beaa0457-b39c-4ce2-894f-e40c00f8e69e][coded messages]] have
recently been transmitted in the vicinity of the Col 70 Sector.

"Something is going on out there," said an unidentified member of the
Imperial intelligence community. "We think it could be...her."

A [[id:5402969f-345d-420c-9025-3a0a89929d11][bounty]] has been issued for Commanders [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salomé]], [[id:7bc38ab5-1b0b-4821-a335-41be23b62612][Tsu Annabelle Singh]]
and [[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]], but with all three [[id:b8479ab3-514a-4907-975e-da666ea6d7ef][fugitives]] still at large, the
[[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Empire]] has increased the bounties to five million for Salomé and two
million apiece for Singh and Corsen. An Imperial spokesperson
reiterated that pilots should not attempt to communicate with these
individuals, and should shoot on sight.

[[id:c5657e15-bd7e-490b-9a7e-ca2ea1da9fb7][Imperial intelligence services]] have also placed a bounty on one
Commander [[id:35c30032-e8ba-4884-807c-c2a775ad0f85][Yuri Nakamura]], referred to as '[[id:35c30032-e8ba-4884-807c-c2a775ad0f85][Conformist Oboe XX]]' in an
intelligence briefing given to the media. A two- million-credit bounty
has been placed on Commander Nakamura.
