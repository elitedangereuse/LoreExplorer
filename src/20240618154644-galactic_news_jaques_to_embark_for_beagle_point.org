/12 May 3302/

A spokesperson for The [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] named [[id:78dc1804-9537-4e52-bba1-ca98efd86229][Mischief]] has announced that
[[id:935880a2-d4fb-4d27-ad48-0f95112ee0fe][Jaques Station]] has received sufficient quantities of fuel to complete
the proposed jump to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]].

[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]], the starport's owner and operator, confirmed that the station
received hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fuel over the course of
the week-long campaign. In a statement, the cyborg expressed his
pleasure at the initiative's success.

"It's a terrific response, it really is. We haven't even set off yet
and already I'm excited! Obviously there's lots of prep to be done –
we can't just go leaping into the black – but we should be ready
pretty soon."

[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station is expected to depart for Beagle Point in the next few
days.
