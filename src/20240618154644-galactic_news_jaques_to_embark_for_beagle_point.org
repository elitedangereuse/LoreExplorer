* Galactic News: Jaques to Embark for Beagle Point

/12 May 3302/

A spokesperson for The Fuel Rats named Mischief has announced that Jaques Station has received sufficient quantities of fuel to complete the proposed jump to Beagle Point.  

Jaques, the starport's owner and operator, confirmed that the station received hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fuel over the course of the week-long campaign. In a statement, the cyborg expressed his pleasure at the initiative's success. 

"It's a terrific response, it really is. We haven't even set off yet and already I'm excited! Obviously there's lots of prep to be done – we can't just go leaping into the black – but we should be ready pretty soon." 

Jaques Station is expected to depart for Beagle Point in the next few days.
