Employing over a quarter of a million full time staff and owning sole
mineral rights to some forty nine planets, the [[id:4889d46d-ac30-4695-9f3d-f4cb6f925c4a][Wreaken Corporation]] can
be found throughout most of the frontier and Federation Worlds.

[[id:d83dcf95-2757-4708-8988-d48f2b345932][Tobias Wreaken]] was a coal miner from old Earth. His company adopted a
cautious and steady approach to its work and this won them a large
number of contracts in the early space industry. Wreaken's descendants
saw massive opportunities in the Colonial Charter policy of the
[[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]] and few Colonial missions set off without a Wreaken
representative and Wreaken equipment.
