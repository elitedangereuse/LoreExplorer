* Frontline Report: [[id:3ae0f41b-9beb-419b-a804-68a000d9666b][Cayutorme]]

/09 Nov 3301/

Imperial forces have begun their offensive against the [[id:3ae0f41b-9beb-419b-a804-68a000d9666b][Cayutorme]] Syndicate and its illegal fleet. Large clashes have occurred over the past few days, and major victories have been won by the forces of the Imperial Navy and its auxiliary force of Commanders. 

The [[id:3ae0f41b-9beb-419b-a804-68a000d9666b][Cayutorme]] Syndicate fleet has put up a good fight, but has been met with overwhelming force. At the time of writing the fight is in a bit of a lull, with only minor skirmishes going on, as the Syndicate begins to deploy reinforcements. If things continue as they have, the Syndicate fleet may have to surrender or face total destruction at the hands of the Imperial Navy. 

Commander Jack Hilding
