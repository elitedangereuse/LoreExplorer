* Urgent Request for Supplies in HIP 22460

/30 Jun 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Medical and military commodities are needed to support the cross-superpower operation in the HIP 22460 system. 

Commodore Morag Halloran, who is coordinating for [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] aboard the Bright Sentinel megaship, outlined the requirements: 

“The Proteus Wave is designed to attract the bulk of the Thargoid fleet before destroying them. We are making preparations to defend [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] from the alien vessels until the superweapon is ready.” 

“Azimuth Biotech is offering generous payment for shipments of advanced medicines, basic medicines and reactive armour. These can be delivered to the Heart of Taurus megaship in HIP 22460.” 

“Specially tailored ship liveries are available as additional rewards, in gratitude to those loyal Commanders who are dedicated to [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s cause of defeating the Thargoids.” 

The anti-xeno taskforces of the Alliance, Empire and Federation are also preparing to engage Thargoid forces in and around HIP 22460. Capital ships have been running combat drills and practising naval manoeuvres. As yet, there is no indication when the anticipated Thargoid fleet may arrive.
