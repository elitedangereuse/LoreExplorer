* Call to Ban [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] Book

/19 Dec 3304/

Disgraced politician Juanita Bishop has called for a forthcoming book about the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] sect to be banned: 

“The authors, Ulyanov and Okonkwo, are known alien sympathisers. One was arrested as a suspected traitor and the other has admitted to being a [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cultist!” 

“What they’re writing is nothing more than pro-Thargoid propaganda. It is an insult to all the brave souls who died trying to keep us safe. The authorities need to prevent this book from contaminating innocent people with its repulsive ideas.” 

Journalist [[id:b9531f53-8bad-4eda-a0aa-46c72bb6ec9a][Gethin Okonkwo]], who spent months undercover in the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] sect, responded: 

“The book includes first-hand accounts of worshippers being attacked by Bishop’s followers. Her desperation to halt its publication is nothing more than an attempt to prevent a criminal investigation into her activities.”
