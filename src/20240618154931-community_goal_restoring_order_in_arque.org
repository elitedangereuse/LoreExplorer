* Community Goal: Restoring Order in [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]]

/18 Aug 3302/

Authorities in the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord. 

To counter this threat, [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] Commodities has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Austen Town Station. 

The campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
