* Galactic News: Bluford Orbital Nears Completion

/10 Mar 3302/

LHS 3447 Dynamic and Co has announced that the campaign to construct a new starport in the LHS 3447 system has reached a successful conclusion. All the necessary materials for the starport have now been received, and the agitators disrupting delivery operations have been neutralised. A spokesperson for the Pilots Federation, which helped to organise the campaign, released a brief statement: 

"Once again the galaxy's independent pilots have demonstrated their remarkable commitment and resolve. This new starport will facilitate travel and trade throughout LHS 3447, and serve as a testament to the dedication and altruism of the galactic community." 

Bluford Orbital is expected to open its doors in the next few days.
