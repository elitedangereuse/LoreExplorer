#+title: Project Dynasty

Project Dynasty was a secret exploration initiative conceived by [[id:8a1ae8ba-e27a-4141-a43a-67bef02cb235][The
Club]] in 3270. In response to the likelihood of a [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] civil war
spilling into human space, The Club sought potential safe havens where
humanity could flee in order to escape the conflict and
survive. Project Dynasty was intended to identify [[id:7fec1142-ab20-47e1-b746-36edee889cc3][Earth-like]] worlds
beyond human space and mark them with [[id:1fd01d13-7a2c-402e-bb92-1b4edadd78c2][beacons]] for later reference. The
project focused on searching three galactic regions: the
[[id:a2c87748-2b25-494e-85a9-18f9d9bff3a3][Scutum-Sagittarii Conflux]], [[id:a503a67b-8110-4ce5-be60-40f5f0762726][Hawking's Gap]], and the [[id:34f7ac72-4ef4-494f-9982-87fbeadd8086][Formidine Rift]].[1]

* The Expeditions
In 3270, Frame Shift Drive-technology did not yet exist and Hyperspace
travel took hours, and Auto Field-Maintenance Units were expensive
experimental devices. Consequently, little exploration had been
attempted outside The Bubble and the Conflux, Hawkin's Gap, and the
Formidine Rift were entirely uncharted; the journey to the Formidine
Rift alone would take a full six months, not including the return
trip.[1]

Zurara Megaship

The Club funded the construction of The Zurara, a state-of-the-art
Megaship designed specifically for long-term exploration and equipped
with the latest AFMUs, and also prepared a number of Anacondas. Their
mission was to locate viable Earth-like worlds in their target areas,
and mark them with beacons to serve as waypoints when the Thargoids
invaded The Bubble and humanity needed a safe haven. To ensure
absolute secrecy for as long as possible, the Project Dynasty
expeditions were never intended to return after they had completed
their objectives. In the case of The Zurara, it was sabotaged and
stranded in the Formidine Rift with no power by sleeper agents who had
been conditioned to sacrifice themselves. The project's other ships
presumably met similar fates.[1]

* The Formidine Rift Mystery

Project Dynasty was at the core of what became known as the Formidine
Rift Mystery. The Formidine Rift is a part of space around 10,000
light-years away from the Core Systems located in the Upper 2 quadrant
of the Milky Way Galaxy. It was thought that the mystery might lead to
the planet of Raxxla. The end result is located somewhere in the
Rift. It has been in game since version 1.0.

The story behind the Formidine Rift mystery was written by [[id:091e2146-510f-4405-96c6-af6b76328eae][Drew Wagar]]
in his book called Elite: Reclamation, which is one of several books
in his series on Elite. Wagar confirmed there's something there to be
found in-game.[2]

John Harper, author of And Here The Wheel, wrote in a Kickstarter
comment:

"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift,
seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood
on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] and erased from
humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] wars,
countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon,
little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."

Commanders have been searching the Rift for years without much success
up until the end of 2016 (3302 in-game date). Then finally, some
navigation beacons were discovered in sectors located in that area of
space. Those beacons had encoded location coordinates which were
quickly revealed to the public.[3]

No one knows for sure what actually happened in the Rift. Commanders
have been able to find a unique settlement down on one of the planets
in the Formidine Rift region, while another has been found in Conflux.
