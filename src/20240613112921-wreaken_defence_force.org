* 0219 Wreaken Defence Force
[[id:bb8ac014-a3ac-4564-9c3a-7aaff6536d59][Zearla]]

WCM is a major customer of [[id:82acae23-bcb1-4f26-bcd4-322220d707f9][Sirius Mining]], making exclusive use of
their equipment, under a long term mutually beneficial deal.

Wreaken operate their own fleet of Federal Cutters and smaller ships
to provide protection to their many installations, but in extreme
cases can call for backup from the [[id:3dd2f3c7-3ddf-4900-aa28-580344edd509][Sirius Navy]] under its commercial
relationship - so it is not unheard of for a [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] battlefleet to
back up a Wreaken defence force. Wreaken pays for this service, but it
has decided die to the distributed nature of their installations, it
is not cost effective to operate its own cruisers.

Many of the ores WCM mines are refined on site, so sale of refined
alloys is a big part of their business.
