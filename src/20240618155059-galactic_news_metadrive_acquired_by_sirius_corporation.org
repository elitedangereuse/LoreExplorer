* Galactic News: MetaDrive Acquired by [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]

/22 Oct 3302/

Board members of MetaDrive Inc. today announced the sale of MetaDrive Inc. to the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. Rosaline Merden, acting Chair of MetaDrive, was clearly pleased with the outcome. At a press conference, she said: 

"The board of MetaDrive wholeheartedly welcomes the security this acquisition brings. As part of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], the MetaDrive brand will continue to go from strength to strength." 

Reporters asked about the ongoing audit of MetaDrive, and also the fate of former employee [[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]], who was reported missing a couple of weeks ago. 

"The audit has been successfully completed and all assets are in the hands of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]," said Merden. [[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]]'s employment was terminated prior to the takeover." 

Merden was challenged by a representative of the Earth Defence Fleet, who alleged that [[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]] had in fact fled from [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] security forces and been killed in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system. 

"Mr Corsen's business in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system was his own," said Merden. "It has nothing to do with the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]." 

The press conference closed with outstanding questions, but reporters managed to get a final word from Commander MoonWeb of the Earth Defence Fleet. 

"According to our intel, Corsen was pursued before crash-landing on a planet in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system. This was observed by Commander Ashley Wilkinson, a Canonn representative working with the Earth Defence Fleet." 

"The specifics surrounding Corsen's demise are not known, but we have a transcript of his final transmission that points a finger squarely at the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]."
