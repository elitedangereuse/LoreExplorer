* Titan Taranis destruction yields extensive data for research projects

/12 Mar 3310/

The recent destruction of Titan Taranis has yielded a significant amount of data that scientists across the galaxy have begun interrogating. 

Science correspondent Leon Banerjee summarised for Vox Galactica: 

“Research on Titans has been ongoing since their first appearance, and understanding how they function has been considered crucial to humanity’s survival in the Thargoid war.” 

“I have spent time with everyone from the smallest private research bodies to the largest corporations in the past few years, and the common anxiety amongst the scientific community is still how little we truly understand about the Titans.” 

“What answers does the caustic remnant of Taranis contain? What might have survived the destruction? When the wreckage is safe enough to enter, the additional data to be found there will doubtless benefit humanity in some form.”
