* Survivor Found at Far God Outpost

/23 Mar 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered an intact cryogenic pod underneath an outpost once used by Far God worshippers. 

Freelance reporter Alexei Keel broke the news on Vox Galactica: 

“The FIA survey team had been scanning the abandoned base on Etain 4 c with customised military sensors. It’s thought this operation is part of a search for a missing undercover agent who infiltrated the Far God cult.” 

“A faint power source was detected in a collapsed underground chamber, which led agents to a solitary cryogenic pod hidden beneath tons of debris. Once excavated, it was conveyed to a medical facility where efforts to safely revive its occupant are now underway.”  

“There was no way of identifying who is inside the pod. But it seems likely that they are one of the adherents who recorded audio logs at the site, prior to entering suspended animation to await the Far God.”
