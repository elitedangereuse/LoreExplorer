* Achilles Aerospace releases full selection of Supercruise Overcharge modules

/09 May 3310/

A suite of new [[id:19a09cd9-f117-4a3e-a334-0cf3a3977612][Supercruise Overcharge]] [[id:46a9c980-af48-4e43-a820-9971d7c76c34][Frame Shift Drives]] entered the
market earlier this week alongside several other upgrades to the new
modules.

To celebrate the company’s recent success, Dr. [[id:b5140e75-b50a-4bd5-82ea-2678c24b0965][Namin Tirel]], [[id:6ebf2d4f-85a9-4251-82c9-406c9c06b5a1][Achilles
Aerospace]]’s Head of Research and Development, offered a rare interview
to [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“It boggles the mind, truly. We were working in secret on what would
eventually become our Supercruise Overcharge technology for over a
year now. We had mountains of data and plenty of theories still to
test, but we were struggling to make headway on anything that had real
practical application. When we got hold of some of the actual parts of
the Thargoids’ drive-like technology, all that time, energy, and
financial investment finally paid off. We were able to make huge
strides in a short time frame, as you’re now seeing.”

“We purposefully made these drives difficult to modify as they’re
still using very new technology, but, with how well the drives are
holding up, we saw fit to relax this restriction.”

“Our latest firmware update also removes the prototype safety limiter
on jump range which goes hand-in-hand with some brilliant fine-tuning
we achieved during development. Not only are our drives capable of
Supercruise Overcharge but we saw a few optimisations we could make
over [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius]]’ aging technology. If you want to go both faster and
further, switch to an Achilles drive.”

“Finally, we have our work with [[id:273d7834-fe3f-4b12-b045-d5d8a62e719a][Faulcon DeLacy]] on their [[id:462821c7-39f9-43bb-8d70-2dedb90f52f3][Python Mk
II]]. This is something that both companies are immensely happy with,
and we want to offer this same collaborative approach to other
manufacturers too.”

“Supercruise Overcharge has been a highlight of my career, and being a
part of its continued development is a privilege. Thank you to my team
helping to create the next phase of space travel, and a special thank
you to the independent pilots who brought us the key pieces of
technology that made all of this possible.”
