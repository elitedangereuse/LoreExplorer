* Galactic News: Curious Message Discovered

/17 Apr 3303/

A group of EM-transmission technology enthusiasts in the [[id:0b991a8e-234a-4888-8c0a-b3c64498f217][Tionisla]] system claims to have found a message in the exploration data gathered last year as part of a campaign organised by the Children of Raxxla. 

A spokesperson for the group, which calls itself The Hamsters, said: 

“It was inside one of the beacon modulator wave harmonics, and it seems to be some sort of rhyme. We’ve studied it but have come up with nothing, so we thought we’d share it with the galactic community.” 

The message is reprinted in full below.
