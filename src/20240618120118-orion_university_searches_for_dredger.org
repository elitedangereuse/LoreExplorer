* Orion University Searches for Dredger

/14 Oct 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Rewards are being offered by Orion University to locate the Scriveners Clan dredger, which it claims as its legal property. 

The self-sustaining Dredger-class bulk cruiser was launched two centuries ago by an academic institute that was later absorbed by the university. Since then the dredger has become the home for a nomadic tribe called the Scriveners Clan, which refuses contact with all outsiders. 

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew told the media: 

“Orion University is willing to reward pilots who can pinpoint the dredger’s current location. We believe it is still within 500 light years of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system.” 

“Pilots who are interested in helping should first dock at Ring Mine station in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, to automatically sign up to the search operation. Our associates at the starport, Deep Space Mining, will provide further information including details of the reward.”
