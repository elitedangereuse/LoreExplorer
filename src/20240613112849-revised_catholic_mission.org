* 0164 Revised Catholic Mission
[[id:f9c2a17e-47a5-4abf-ab4f-ff3f9a1c0bd3][Aymiay]]

Based in Aymiay at a University, with two further institutions on
[[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] and [[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]], the Revised Catholic Mission grew out of one of a
select few older religions and has tried to update its tenets to
reflect the changing nature of interstellar society. The old religious
values of pre-space-travel Earth could not cope with the scientific
progress of the 3rd and 4th millennium. The 'revised mission', to
bring an understanding of moral living, repentance and the need to
earn a place in heaven became a more inclusive set of values that
could be promoted throughout human interstellar society.
