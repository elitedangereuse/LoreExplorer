* Concerns Raised over Alliance-Sirius Pact

/08 Feb 3308/

The recent battle in the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system has caused [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]
to question the terms of its partnership with the Alliance.

[[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][The Alliance Tribune]]’s political correspondent [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] reported: 

“When [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] megaships arrived in four Allied systems,
it’s fair to assume they anticipated a degree of public
resistance. But being directly attacked by the [[id:83d61aae-150c-4a38-81aa-0443046505c3][Reorte Mining Coalition]]
clearly wasn’t part of their risk assessment.”

“[[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] has urgently sought assurances from the Alliance that
such conflicts will not happen again. The megacorp’s CEO claimed that
he has a duty to protect his employees from aggression by their own
clients.”

“In response, [[id:7361b97b-004a-4243-920c-d0e8d93479b0][Prime Minister]] [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] personally guaranteed that
this unfortunate incident was a one-off, stressing that [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius]]
personnel have been welcomed in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]], [[id:b716cd52-6ba1-4fdc-a555-d01bc73b2893][Arimpox]] and [[id:25537b36-1d83-4354-afeb-482bf891d85d][Di Jian]]
systems. He added that the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] is working closely
with Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], the [[id:3dd2f3c7-3ddf-4900-aa28-580344edd509][Sirius Navy]]’s representative.”

“But others in the [[id:48ac5ad9-dd0e-4d43-a109-f4cf6d3efdea][Assembly]] are now openly questioning the wisdom of
the strategic defence pact. Although Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]]’s
opposition to [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Mahon]] is often viewed as predictable, more members now
agree with her that many Allied factions will reject the assertion
that [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] is an ally to be trusted.”
