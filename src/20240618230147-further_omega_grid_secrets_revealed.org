* Further [[id:22dfd239-84ed-4b35-aa95-bc955ca95e8b][Omega Grid]] Secrets Revealed

/21 Feb 3308/

[[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]] has released details about a plan by the Lords of Restoration to frame [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]] as the leader of the NMLA.

The information was extracted from the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]]’s [[id:22dfd239-84ed-4b35-aa95-bc955ca95e8b][Omega Grid]] network and published by Captain [[id:ccaf380d-14e8-4a1a-9458-8c3bad87b25c][Saskia Landau]]:

“It was Senator [[id:e12798d1-e602-483f-bb53-46256d0f6aa9][Ursula Torquatus]] who devised a scheme to undermine the
Imperial Family and turn citizens against them by ‘exposing’ a [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duval]]
as the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] mastermind. [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] was seen as the logical choice
since many viewed him as an extremist through his prior association
with [[id:64e89e89-f7fe-4f90-bc29-1cd90497e1f1][Nova Imperium]], though Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] officially
pardoned him in 3306.”

“The [[id:ffa239ce-f149-4c43-9455-26a4fa753e1c][Lords of Restoration]] used a virtual [[id:7a5deea9-1363-4fe7-8be9-b60f9943f302][doppelganger]] of the Emperor,
indistinguishable from authentic transmissions, to convince the [[id:6b539fa1-7ebe-44d3-874b-41a3bd400af9][Senate]]
that she was communicating from a safe location. A similar
doppelganger was developed to replicate Hadrian and was used to send
orders to [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] allies such as the [[id:5ac1b987-74bc-4f98-bca8-54e987c548ff][Landgrave of Mudhrid]].”

“This is how they planted evidence, discovered in April 3307, that
[[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian]] had converted to [[id:ec1cb30c-2e72-410b-a664-0d609a352100][Neo-Marlinism]] and was determined to wipe out
all other [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duvals]]. Yet, despite triggering an unsuccessful Federal
attack in the Paresa system, the accusation was not verified or widely
believed.”

“Months later, the [[id:ffa239ce-f149-4c43-9455-26a4fa753e1c][Lords of Restoration]] [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][tried to kill]] Hadrian and [[id:ef9ddb06-8cb2-4c3f-a688-469be3149aa9][Lady
Astrid]] before their son [[id:c51145ab-32ee-42ec-a884-bbbc263b06dd][Hector]] could be born, fearing the continuation
of the Duval dynasty. But other senators moved the family to a secure
location, beyond the reach of their agents.”

[[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] has publicly thanked [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]] for uncovering this information
and officially absolving him of all suspicion in this matter.
