* Galactic News: Diamond Frogs Campaign Concludes

/15 Dec 3303/

The Diamond Frogs have announced that their campaign to construct an installation in the 63 G. Capricorni system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. This has resulted in a massive influx of deliveries to Skvortsov Orbital, the organisationâ€™s base of operations. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G Capricorni system.
