* Galactic News: Tantalum Appeal Extended

/11 May 3302/

The Wyrd Raiders have announced that their campaign for tantalum has been extended. A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed that this was to ensure targets would be met. 

In a brief statement, the spokesperson said: 

"We are extremely grateful for the support we have received so far. But it is clear that for this campaign to succeed, we will need to give pilots more time to source the tantalum we have asked for." 

The campaign is now scheduled to end on the 19th of May 3302.
