* Galactic News: Assassination Attempt on Patreus Thwarted

/20 Aug 3302/

Recent reports indicate that an attempt was made on the life of Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] as he delivered a speech at Mackenzie Relay in the [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]] system. The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that it apprehended three individuals carrying firearms who attempted to approach the admiral's podium. 

Following the incident, Admiral Patreus appeared slightly shaken but said: "I will never submit to terror. These individuals will be brought to justice." 

Subsequent reports identified the culprits as belonging to the organisation Emperor's Dawn, but it is rumoured that the dissidents were bankrolled and supported by a second party. 

"Emperor's Dawn was smashed – it's history," said a researcher for the Imperial Citizen. "Someone else was behind this – someone with a major grudge against Patreus."
