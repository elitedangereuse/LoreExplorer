* NMLA Retakes the Steel Majesty

/17 Nov 3307/

A former Neo-Marlinist megaship has been overrun by NMLA terrorists in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system. 

The Steel Majesty was originally owned by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, one of the NMLA’s key allies. After their defeat, it ferried many of them to the Marlinist Colonies where they were granted asylum by Minister Aaron Whyte. His faction then made use of the megaship during the civil war in August. 

Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the current leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, gave a statement: 

“Despite our efforts to arrest any remaining extremists within our faction, a surviving group has gained access to the megaship. Security feeds show they were joined by several teams of well-armed NMLA fighters.” 

“The Marlinist Constabulary evacuated around half of the Steel Majesty’s crew before the NMLA took operational control. Sadly, there is no way to free those still trapped onboard.” 

The situation was addressed by ACT’s co-leader Captain Milo Castile: 

“According to our intel, a majority of the NMLA’s surviving cells have gathered together for this operation. We believe they were assisted by not only Aaron Whyte’s loyalists, but also members of the megaship’s original crew from the Mudhrid system.” 

“It is possible that this Neo-Marlinist coalition was formed as a result of us closing in on Theta Seven. We have requested additional support from all security services.”
