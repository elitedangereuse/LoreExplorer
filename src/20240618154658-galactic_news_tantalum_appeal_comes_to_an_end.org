* Galactic News: Tantalum Appeal Comes to an End

/19 May 3302/

A spokesperson for the Wyrd Raiders has announced that its campaign for tantalum has been warmly received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Gareth Edwards Park, the organisation's base of operations. In a succinct statement, the spokesperson thanked those who supported the campaign. 

"We are very grateful to the many independent pilots who helped us fulfil our commercial obligations. The tantalum will now be delivered to our various partners." 

Since the campaign began, rumours have persisted that the tantalum was destined for a group of independent engineers. The Wyrd Raiders declined to comment on the matter, citing a need to maintain their partners' privacy.
