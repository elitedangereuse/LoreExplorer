* Rackham Fatality Creates Power Struggle

/15 Mar 3305/

Rackham Capital Investments has appointed a new CFO following the death of its former financial officer. 

Business analyst [[id:d4e49144-20cb-468e-b3ce-f594c2b5bf13][Marlon Royce]] reported on the situation: 

“Aaron Salazar was CFO at [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]] from its inception. After a sudden cardiac arrest at the Ivystone Spa proved terminal, the board of directors voted to install Taja Gavaris as his replacement. Little is known of Gavaris outside of her meteoric rise up the corporate ladder.” 

“CEO [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] was not present at the vote, the CEO has taken a leave of absence to cope with his grief. “The multi-billionaire businessman, also known as ‘Calico Zack’, established the company following a lucrative career as an independent trader, although rumours persist that he actually operated as a pirate.” 

“Insiders have speculated that Gavaris’s appointment may be part of a scheme to oust Rackham from the top spot.”
