* 0214 Rockforth Corporation Founding
[[id:7075359f-79ca-4a24-88da-64f22e6b024a][Ackwada]]

The [[id:a7056ff8-e67d-4ca9-baf1-7e5df3efa677][Rockforth Corporation]] was founded on [[id:77a7a843-4242-4da8-a764-c1525e6ceefe][Ackwada]] by the Rockforth
Family in 2673, the family that first settled the world.

The Rockforth Corporation began by running [[id:77a7a843-4242-4da8-a764-c1525e6ceefe][Ackwada]] earning significant
foreign exchange from tourism and 'genuine ground-grown food' which it
sold far and wide, making very significant revenues. It has since
grown into a powerful interstellar corporation, still specialising in
agriculture and tourism, with the corporation running giant corporate
farms on habitable worlds across especially Federal human space. It
has also become quite acquisitive, buying up many of its client
companies.
