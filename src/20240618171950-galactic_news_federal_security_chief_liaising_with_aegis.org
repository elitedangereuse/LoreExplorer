* Galactic News: Federal Security Chief Liaising with Aegis

/19 Aug 3303/

Reports have surfaced that Admiral Aden Tanner, Chief of Federal Security and so-called ‘alien tsar’, is now liaising with Aegis, the inter-superpower initiative established to investigate the Thargoids. 

News of Admiral Tanner’s involvement has already prompted speculation that the cold war between the Empire and the Federation could be thawing. Contrasting voices have suggested that Tanner’s association could divert Aegis from its scientific agenda and set it on a more militaristic course. 

In the wake of this development, Admiral Tanner made the following statement: 

“It is my sincere pleasure to support Aegis in its mission and contribute to what I hope will be a new era of collaboration. I know there are those who have questioned my involvement with Aegis, but I can assure you that after forty years in the military, I am ready for some peace.” 

“Our current priorities are determining the scale of the Thargoids’ presence in human space and confirming their intentions regarding humanity. We have no concrete information to share with the galactic community at this time, however.”
