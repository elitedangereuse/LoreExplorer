* Survey Initiative Successful, Says Brewer Corporation

/19 Feb 3311/

A recent survey initiative organised by [[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]] has been hailed as a success by CEO [[id:0a249cc4-6f5d-4467-bf34-d6419b838581][Madelyn Teague]].

High quantities of exploration data were handed in at the [[id:454c41b7-95ca-4e7e-94d4-c8a3f9d61d0e][Trailblazer
Echo]] megaship in the [[id:0a9dd112-c2a6-47d8-9056-a334912820bf][HIP 90578]] system. The data will now be analysed
by [[id:2fb00d7f-7234-45fa-8e3c-af685aa8f0d8][Universal Cartographics]] to assess the prime locations in each
system for permanent human structures.

[[id:0a249cc4-6f5d-4467-bf34-d6419b838581][Teague]] made the following announcement:

“We are pleased that so many explorers have contributed to this
initiative. The latest wave of survey data will be processed through a
recently updated software algorithm for the next phase of preparation,
in pursuit of a widespread expansion campaign. That campaign will be
led by factions and communities across the core systems.”

Interest in the survey campaign has been met with enthusiasm by many
displaced communities resulting by the Thargoid War, who see talk of a
‘new frontier’ as a chance at a fresh start.

However, the initiative was briefly disrupted by lockdown within the
system, initiated by a number of rogue Commanders. This has been
perceived by many groups as an attempt to sabotage humanity's first
expansion efforts in many years, although their motives remain
unclear.

Participants to the campaign can now collect their rewards from the
Trailblazer Echo in HIP 90578.
