* Councillor Kaine Campaigns for Alliance Votes

/22 Jan 3307/

Councillor Nakato Kaine is visiting key systems across the Alliance as part of her bid to be elected as the next prime minister. 

Of all the challengers to the incumbent [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]], Kaine has the most support from fellow council members. She has represented the Tionisla system for nearly a decade, and is renowned for delivering forceful speeches before the Assembly. 

Kaine’s disapproval of the expansionist policies in recent years has struck a chord with people in many systems. She also has a strong reputation among the ‘Old Worlds’, which are viewed as the historic hub of the Alliance. 

During a political rally on Leesti, Councillor Kaine directly criticised her election opponent: 

“Prime Minister Mahon clearly thinks that the Alliance must mimic the Empire’s arrogance and the Federation’s corporate greed. He has repeatedly led us into conflict with the Thargoid race, risking millions of lives so we could raid their territories like thieves in the night.” 

“I believe that we should be inspired by the mutual cooperation that once made the Old Worlds thrive. We must invest in trade and security to benefit our member systems, instead of pretending to be a monolithic superpower.”
