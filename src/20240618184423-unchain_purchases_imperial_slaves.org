* Unchain Purchases Imperial Slaves

/20 Jul 3305/

The anti-slavery charity Unchain has officially purchased the 4,000 Imperial slaves who were forcibly freed on [[id:9fa174ce-7273-40ba-a0e6-1225bcda40b6][Eotienses]] A 3. 

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]], the charity’s patron, gave the following statement to the press: 

“The contracts of all those liberated against their will have been acquired by Unchain. They will be properly cared for while they work to build a new Unchain headquarters in Port Isabelle. This will allow them to pay off their debts and become free citizens once more.” 

When pressed further by journalists, Princess Aisling offered a wry smile along with her explanation: 

“I’m well aware of the irony of an anti-slavery organisation hiring Imperial slaves. We do this only to prevent further suffering at Port Isabelle and undo some of the damage caused by Autonomy. Allow me to specify that this is a practical solution to a problem of the Empire’s own making.” 

“The indentured servitude system may seem honourable, but – as recent events prove – it leaves people vulnerable to abuse and neglect. Unchain remains dedicated to replacing the barbaric practice of slavery with more civilised welfare and employment programmes.”
