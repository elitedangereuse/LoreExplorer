* Utopia Condemns Approval of Vitadyne Nanomedicines

/26 Jan 3305/

The decision of the Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) to approve Vitadyne Labs’s nanomedicines has been condemned by Utopia. 

Simguru Pranav Antal made this statement: 

“The IHO has allowed Vitadyne to steal and replicate Utopian nanomedical technology purely for their financial gain. This is why we do not share our advancements with the galaxy.” 

Independent healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey commented: 

“Vitadyne sees the Interstellar Health Organisation's decision as a victory, but others in the medical community have expressed reservations. To deny Utopia’s ownership of these nanomedicines means permanently closing the door on any future cooperation with the community. What other potential benefits have been lost?” 

Vitadyne Labs has invited pharmaceutical giants Neomedical Industries and Vandermeer Corporation to bid for a licence to distribute Vitadyne nanomeds in their territories.
