* Appeal for Computing Commodities

/20 Sep 3304/

Two rival technology companies – [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] and [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] – have appealed for commodities to support the release of forthcoming products. 

[[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]], CEO of [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], issued the following statement:  

“The Torc is the latest in personal computing, featuring state-of-the-art holographic technology. Anyone who wants to benefit from the next generation in wearable hardware should support its development.” 

Meanwhile, [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], head of [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]], had this to say: 

“The Duradrive cannot be rivalled for power or customisability. What people need in this challenging age is a robust product, not some ephemeral toy that malfunctions when exposed to a stiff breeze.” 

To bring their products to market, both companies have placed open orders for commodities. [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] requires Conductive Fabrics, Robotics and Microcontrollers, while [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] has asked for Consumer Technology, Hardware Diagnostic Sensors and Computer Components. Pilots wishing to support Supratech should deliver commodities to Roberts Port in the Fedmich system, while pilots wishing to support Herculean Machines should deliver commodities to Cowper Dock in the Anima system. 

The campaigns begin on the 20th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If either party achieves its aims earlier than planned, both campaigns will end immediately.
