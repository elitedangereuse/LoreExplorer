* The Mystery of the [[id:1cffca4e-480b-46bf-b6c5-0af48c7292d3][Blight]]

/14 Oct 3305/

The cause of mass crop spoilage on key agricultural worlds has been attributed to a new disease affecting plants. 

Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture summarised the organisation’s findings: 

“The rapid decay of plant life on multiple planets was caused by the same strain of advanced blight. Its origin and vectors remain unknown, and it has so far resisted all established methods of treatment.” 

“Our analysis has not determined if the blight is a natural mutation or an artificial pathogen. Until we confirm this and develop a method of preventing further spread, viable cropland will become scarcer and the production of staple foods will continue to drop.” 

“The Vandermeer Corporation has offered to assist the IAA with its research. The company’s experience of molecular diagnostics will hopefully contribute to a breakthrough.” 

Journalist Adalyn Cross reported on this development for Vox Galactica: 

“Speculation on the cause of the blight has spread like wildfire, with theories ranging from chronic mismanagement to industrial sabotage. Political enemies are also being blamed in every affected system, with competing factions quick to lay the blame at each other’s doorstep.” 

“As tensions rise and billions find themselves short on food, such accusations are likely to escalate to dangerous levels. Trade initiatives and charitable imports are all proving helpful, but will that be enough to stave off disaster?”
