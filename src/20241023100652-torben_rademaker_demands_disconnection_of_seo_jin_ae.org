* [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] Demands ‘Disconnection’ of Seo Jin-ae

/21 Oct 3310/

[[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] CEO [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] has claimed that [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]]'s
current medical situation is ‘dangerous’ for humanity.

Last week, [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]]’ special advisor [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]] fell into a [[id:7ec102a9-059e-4a16-b89d-2450cb2b20ad][coma]] following a
violent [[id:758c0315-3359-45b0-8880-550f4bea806a][seizure]]. Head of [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] confirmed the incident
shortly afterwards, stating that [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]] was receiving the best possible
care at an [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] medical facility.

Following a request for comment statement by [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]’s [[id:8a3f6489-2b06-4494-89ce-5094392c7a99][Conrad
Sterling]], [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Rademaker]] discussed his views on the latest developments in
the Thargoid war and the status of [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]]:

“The original [[id:1b9c3313-e8f2-46a5-9c8e-9946a6838570][whistleblower]] of this tragic event did everybody a huge
favour. No doubt [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] would have hidden the truth otherwise, as the
initiative has done so many times over the years.”

“One thing I noticed from Ms. [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Tesreau]]’s statement was the lack of any
reference to the ‘incredibly [[id:0d4df20c-4e78-4945-9218-0bdb08459a9b][high brain activity]]’ mentioned by the
[[id:1b9c3313-e8f2-46a5-9c8e-9946a6838570][whistleblower]]. Surely if this detail were incorrect, it would have
been refuted. Instead, it was ignored. Isn’t that strange, [[id:8a3f6489-2b06-4494-89ce-5094392c7a99][Conrad]]?”

“I can only conclude that the link [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]] possesses to the Thargoid [[id:cf8efef4-6db7-4780-9b79-6321b738adfc][hive
mind]] is active in ways we cannot comprehend. And that is a danger we
simply must not permit. I call on [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] to do the right thing and
disconnect [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]] from whatever external force has control of
her. By any means necessary.”

When called for a response, an [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] spokesperson simply mentioned
that [[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Rademaker]]’s comments were ‘characteristically insensitive.’ The
latest update on [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]]’s condition suggests she is currently stable but
remains [[id:ad3a5cb7-c1d7-4315-8fec-d6d01fa17a68][unconscious]].
