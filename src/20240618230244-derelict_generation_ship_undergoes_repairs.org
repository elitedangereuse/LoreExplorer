* Derelict Generation Ship Undergoes Repairs

/26 May 3308/

The [[id:c790ca5d-65c5-4e8e-a278-7fbd11a5f092][Artificers Clan]] has begun to retrofit the [[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][generation ship]] [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]]
into a fully operational modern vessel.

[[id:24bc363b-5b71-4968-96b9-2feae4296068][Jonathon Forester]], former captain of the vacated 22nd-century craft,
provided a statement to [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“When the [[id:eb7f4d60-9116-4d68-a0c2-13ac1e74d72e][dredger clan]] first arrived in the [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system, we
feared they had come to salvage the Golconda. Instead, to our
surprise, they’ve initiated engineering work on it: reinforcing the
ship’s structural integrity, repairing damaged components, and
installing modern engines and navigational systems. Yet the decks
where our community previously lived remains untouched.”

“The Artificers didn’t request permission to do this, which upset many
of us. But today we received a message expressing a strange,
child-like excitement at finding what they called a ‘dead-hulk’, and
their determination to ‘revive’ it for us. With their incredible
skills, it’s possible that the Golconda could become spaceworthy again
within weeks.”

“This has prompted a huge debate among my people. Should we return to
our old home? Some have grown accustomed to the benefits of living at
this outpost. Others believe we should resume journeying between the
stars, as our ancestors did for centuries.”

“Many are looking to me for leadership, and I must admit to finding
such a decision hard. I thought the Golconda was our history, but
perhaps it still holds our future.”
