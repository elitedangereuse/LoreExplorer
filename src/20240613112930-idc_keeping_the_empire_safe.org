Senate. Officially it operates embassies in most foreign sysems, but
the IDC has far-reaching powers too and unlike other police units has
jurisdiction throughout the Empire. It can support Senators and
Ambassadors abroad.

The Ambassadors are the visible members of the IDC; high-ranking
Imperial officials usually reporting directly to a specific Senator
with an interest in their area, but also reporting directly to the
Senate. Each Ambassador has a significant staff and budget to project
Imperial influence. This staff is said to include secret agents that
operate covertly within foreign powers and corporations, but reporting
back ultimaterly to the Ambassadors, then on to the [[id:b1182341-2de3-4e2c-8056-2bcea537233a][Senate]].
