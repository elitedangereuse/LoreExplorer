* Cult Requests Rare Commodities

/06 Dec 3304/

An obscure cult based in the Zlota system has requested a range of rare items for an arcane ceremony. 

A handwritten statement from Barnabas Cole, leader of a group named the Children of Tothos, was submitted to the media: 

“This is the rite that will unmask us and allow us to see the path – the path we will all take, together, toward freedom.” 

Zlota Federal Holdings, which is thought to have some connection to the cult, has requested Aganippe Rush, Motrona Experience Jelly and Onion Head to be delivered to Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system. It has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to protect those delivering these rare commodities. 

The initiative begins on the 6th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
