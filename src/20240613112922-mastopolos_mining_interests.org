* 0222 Mastopolos Mining Interests
[[id:7d12ffc5-6340-4b45-8c32-d63af1e5cbf1][Enayex]]

[[id:4dfc1d85-8d12-4503-a4ed-84da898a03ba][Mastopolos Mining]] is highly rated to do business with. Despite its
name, the corporation has broad interests, mostly in and around
Imperial space. It operates a fleet of large [[id:017cc8d7-ba23-46a8-aee3-60a9b75f1cce][transport]] ships -
initially to transport its own raw materials around and to supply its
mining installations, but it has extended this to carry other goods
too. It now runs three whole systems as corporate states, operating
its own law (close to Imperial Law), and policed by its own security
service. It also has a large number of outposts dotted around, covered
by the same security service.

It operates its own navy based around its security service, using a
small number of Imperial cruisers in company colours, together with a
fleet of [[id:ab621e71-06dd-443a-a038-6e84e1c9e04e][cutters]]. These tend to deal with [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]] incursions, and
escort its transport when outside 'civilised' space, while the
security service deals with personal issues 'on the ground'.
