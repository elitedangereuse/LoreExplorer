* President Halsey Announces Tour of Frontier Systems

/28 Apr 3301/

The Presidentâ€™s office has today announced that President Halsey will soon be setting off on a tour of the Federal frontier systems. 

The purported aim of the trip is to build stronger links between [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] and its many offspring. For years, Federal frontier systems have complained that the Mars Congress has consistently failed to provide adequate support for fledgling Federal colonies.   

During the tour, local leaders will be given a chance to meet with President Halsey to discuss what [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] can do to better support local governments, frontier enterprises and Federal residents. 

Some of the destinations announced include Hip 53688, Tinia, 78 Ursae Majoris, Su and Furuhjlem I-645. Other destinations are expected to be added at a later date.
