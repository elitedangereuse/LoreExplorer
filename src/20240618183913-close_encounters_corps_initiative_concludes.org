* Close Encounters Corps Initiative Concludes

/18 Oct 3304/

The Close Encounters Corps has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community.  

A huge number of muon imagers were delivered to Crown Prospect over the past week. These will allow the construction of a scientific megaship to research the nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. 

With the initiative at an end, Admiral Anton Vern of the Close Encounters Corps issued the following statement: 

“I am grateful for the professionalism displayed by the pilots who took part in this project, and thank them on behalf of our researchers. New horizons and new worlds await us.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Crown Prospect in the Kagutsuchi system.
