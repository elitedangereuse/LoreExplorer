* Atlas Corporation Initiative Concludes

/13 Apr 3304/

A spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation has announced that its campaign to build a megaship in the Lambda Arae system has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Redi Market and by eliminating agitators in Lambda Arae, thereby allowing traders to operate safely. 

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Atlas Corporation released the following statement: 

“We would like to thank the pilots who helped us achieve our goal. We appreciate the assistance of each and every one of you.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Redi Market in the Lambda Arae system.
