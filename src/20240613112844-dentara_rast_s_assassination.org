Later in 3251, the assassination of Dentara Rast, began a chain of de-stabilising events that would lead, in 3262, to an interstellar proxy war in the system. Imperial agents were blamed for Rast's death as were INRA and the Federation. The cancellation of the elections and lack of a clear perpetrator turned the once peaceful and wealthy Tiliala on its head. Both the Federation and Empire saw the valuable metal as something they could not pass up, Publically the Federation claimed it was 'supporting the stable government', whilst the Empire claimed to be 'assisting in the liberation of an oppresssed populace'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |   |
