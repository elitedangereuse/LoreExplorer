* 0154 Dentara Rast's Assassination
[[id:35ef7825-95ca-418d-9cc2-9e7934b351c9][Tiliala]]

Later in 3251, the [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassination]] of [[id:79832d10-b5db-4944-a808-e5b2f11c2cb7][Dentara Rast]], began a chain of
de-stabilising events that would lead, in 3262, to an interstellar
proxy war in the system. [[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Imperial]] agents were blamed for Rast's death
as were [[id:39a31dd8-3750-4507-90b7-b649d0eeecef][INRA]] and the [[id:29d1e8f4-004d-4d0f-b838-265c302d8187][Federation]]. The cancellation of the elections and
lack of a clear perpetrator turned the once peaceful and wealthy
Tiliala on its head. Both the Federation and Empire saw the valuable
metal as something they could not pass up, Publically the Federation
claimed it was 'supporting the stable government', whilst the Empire
claimed to be 'assisting in the liberation of an oppresssed populace'.
