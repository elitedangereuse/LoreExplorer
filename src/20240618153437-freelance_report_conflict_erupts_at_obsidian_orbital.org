* Freelance Report: Conflict Erupts at Obsidian Orbital

/29 Jan 3302/

Anti-meta-alloy protests have spilled into violence during the final day of Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]]'s request. Groups of protestors blockaded the entrance to Obsidian Orbital, and as talks between station personnel and the protestors broke down, tempers flared. One of those gathering meta-alloys for Professor Palin offered this first-hand account: 

"I received a message from one of my wing-mates that things weren't looking good at Obsidian, but I had a full hold, so I had to go. As I dropped into Maia I saw that my ship's computer had put me about eight kilometres from the starport. Then I saw the Cutter coming at me with hardpoints deploying, and the next thing I knew I was taking fire!" 

"My Asp isn't the best when it comes to a head-on fight, but I knew if I could get through the mail slot I would be fine. I boosted like hell and just managed to make it through. I lost my shields and about 50% of my hull, but I managed." 

For the time being, it's a dangerous game in Maia.
