* Galactic News: [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] Comments on Halsey's Committal

/14 May 3302/

At a recent event at the Mars Business Society, Federal Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] responded to a question concerning the hospitalisation of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey: 

"It was clear from the outset that she'd experienced a traumatic event, and that it impacted her psychologically as well as physically. I hope she receives the treatment she needs." 

When asked about Halsey's alleged mystical experiences, Winters replied: 

"Frankly, I find the question distasteful. She has undergone a harrowing experience – an experience that would have affected even the strongest of us – and drawing attention to her so-called 'visions' is counterproductive to restoring her mental health."
