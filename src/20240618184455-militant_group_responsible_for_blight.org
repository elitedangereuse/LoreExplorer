* Militant Group Responsible for [[id:1cffca4e-480b-46bf-b6c5-0af48c7292d3][Blight]]

/22 Oct 3305/

An extremist group from the Kappa Fornacis system is responsible for the contaminated fertiliser that has caused widespread crop failures. 

Gino Borstein made this statement on behalf of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the blight’s origin: 

“Our investigation has confirmed that an activist group known as Scythe of Panem managed to infiltrate Rockforth Corporation manufacturing plants in the Riedquat system. Members of the group contaminated the EX7 fertiliser with a synthetic agent designed to putrefy plant matter.”  

Recent efforts by the galactic community have almost eradicated the EX7 fertiliser. But Borstein warned that the activists have turned hostile upon discovery. 

“The group’s manifesto discusses revenge for the Federation’s 3301 campaign to wipe out the recreational drug known as Onion Head. This involved an orbital bombardment of Onion Head crops on Panem using biocides with a similar genomic structure to the blight. It’s likely that the activists used these biocides as the foundation of their synthetic agent.” 

“Shortly after we located Scythe of Panem cells in the Quator system, their more militant members responded with unprovoked violence. Local citizens are now at risk of being caught in the crossfire.” 

An effort to neutralise the activists is being led by the Bruthanvan Co faction, which has requested tactical support from the galactic community. 

Independent pilots who destroy Scythe of Panem ships in the Quator system will be generously rewarded by Bruthanvan Co. This campaign will run from the 22nd to the 28th of October 3305.
