* Coalsack Nebula Project Gathers Ammonia Worlds Data

/10 Dec 3306/

*[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots Federation]] ALERT* 

Explorers have catalogued many ammonia worlds for a [[id:c85d1251-b6f2-460f-9a24-b1aba6b14097][Sirius
Atmospherics]] terraforming project in the [[id:88b18bc5-5e3a-4165-bd1f-9d352b70ade6][Coalsack Nebula]].

The subsidiary of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] is one of several companies that
are working in partnership with the Alliance to commercially exploit
the region.

Project director [[id:eb0165b3-7d95-4887-ad0c-3db012756434][Dr Maximilian North]] announced the successful
completion of the initiative:

“The data provided on planets with ammonia-based atmospheres will be
invaluable to our terraforming simulations. With our new environmental
techniques, some of these poisonous worlds within the nebula may one
day become habitable.”

Sirius Atmospherics has confirmed that payouts for all contributing
pilots are now available at [[id:ae06f8b5-b73a-43db-a04f-e31f396777b1][Betancourt Base]] in the [[id:10bb0672-e25e-4ab1-a412-4e858663a566][Musca Dark Region
PJ-P b6-1]] system.

As the expansion into the [[id:88b18bc5-5e3a-4165-bd1f-9d352b70ade6][Coalsack Nebula]] progresses, [[id:bcaa9222-b056-41cf-9361-68dd8d3424fb][Commodore Morag
Halloran]] of the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] commented on the possibility of
further attacks from the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]]:

“[[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][Anti-xeno]] security is not as stringent as we had planned, due to the
low availability of [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][ADF]] vessels and [[id:a6b33331-c1bb-44cf-9717-f72eb0f63c99][Aegis]] being impacted by [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federal]]
and Imperial defunding. It may be necessary to call upon the galactic
community again, should we encounter further interference from the
Thargoids.”
