* Freelance Report: [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] Reach Milestone

/18 Apr 3302/

A [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] public relations official has announced that the
collective has now succeeded in rescuing more than 10,000 stranded
pilots.

Comprising a widespread network of voluntary search and rescue agents,
the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] has maintained a success rate of over 95% since its
foundation in June 3301. On average, the group saves 36 pilots a day.

"The [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] is the only collective entirely dedicated to such
rescues," said the representative. "For a cooperative based on
volunteers, donations and goodwill to reach such a milestone in less
than a year is impressive."

"When I look back at our anarchic beginnings, and see this ragtag
bunch of misfit explorers expand into this remarkable cooperative, I
am humbled."

The representative also explained that the group is planning a
memorial service for all those the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] failed to save. The
service is currently planned for the 5th of May 3302 and is scheduled
to run for one week.
