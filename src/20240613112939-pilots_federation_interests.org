[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][The Pilots Federation]] as an organisation controls a vast financial
empire. This is not public knowledge, although the major intelligence
services are aware of the fact. However for the most part these
financial resources are used to improve safety for pilots and for
funding bounties used to improve safety for pilots and for funding
bounties where local authorities do not (or in uncontrolled space),
some governments have been known to take advantage of this.

The Pilots Federation also takes a private interest in the independent
venture with new colonies, this will typically be masked by front
companies. In only one known case has the PF taken control of a world
or system - see the Founders' World section below.

As well as providing fund for bounties it also receives transaction
fees for completed bounties that are processed through the PF bounty
system - and in many cases retains unclaimed bounties where, for
whatever reason, the pilot who has earned it doesn't claim it.

By far the most significant contribution to the PF's finances is the
near monopoly it has for the embedded ship and station systems.
