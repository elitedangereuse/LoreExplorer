* Galactic Mysteries: Generation Ships

/02 Apr 3307/

[[id:0367ce6a-a18b-4bca-a6d1-da93c2dd200f][Erik Gunnarson]] and [[id:43e76135-cf13-47bf-9a0c-4d46dbdfa19a][Francesca Wolfe]] investigate the abandoned [[id:23f66b0e-9198-4dc8-a11c-fea8851e4e6d][relics]] of
spacefaring communities from the early years of [[id:d1f19609-fdb7-4991-bcb2-e93435f013d0][colonisation]].

Wolfe: “[[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][Generation ships]] are essentially mobile cities designed to
carry expanding populations, and are always an impressive sight. But
there’s one I keep returning to – the [[id:98476f7f-baa5-442b-ab2a-ae48dba2436e][Thetis]], orbiting [[id:9043e322-1b78-4e56-b487-29f4363ba18b][Nefertem 6 a]].”

“Listening to its logs always chills my blood. They describe how a
whispered phrase from an uninhabited planet somehow caused over 17,000
people to slaughter each other. Nobody knows if it was mass hysteria,
psychological stress from decades in space, or… something else.”

“So many visits to the Thetis, and I still can’t work up the nerve to
play its final log entry. I’ve been warned that I won’t be the same
afterwards.”

Gunnarson: “Before hyperdrives, generation ships were a viable way to
colonise distant star systems. Millions of people lived out their
whole lives within self-contained societies, so their descendants
might walk upon new worlds.”

“The tragedy is that many of these pioneering megaships [[id:6ccd4f78-28b4-4206-8194-647814a8ce69][vanished]]
entirely, never reaching their destinations. But some were
rediscovered, usually because of listening posts intercepting their
ancient broadcasts.”

“There are various reasons why these expeditions failed. The [[id:860578ca-af20-4688-9781-7f37f3d8826f][Lazarus]],
now orbiting [[id:9aa10ff9-9d16-4fa4-9dfe-a4e4e3c5ab61][Virudnir 6]], suffered mechanical breakdowns whereas the
[[id:6c4bc464-be90-4f7e-aa47-a86200f183a6][Pleione]], in the [[id:a775dfc5-e008-45d6-8b87-2e33224be63a][Hez Ur]] system, had a population that only produced
[[id:c314374f-62bf-4c29-9aed-70406006489b][male]] babies.”

“Most disturbing are those where the crew descended into barbarism,
like the [[id:845d8ae3-0796-40a0-bd5c-d6d552243edb][Artemis]] at [[id:1e062b8e-1e6d-4b48-adba-fa4dd58475d8][Mu Cassiopeia C 1]] and the [[id:f17e0680-5d5b-4900-87a3-07bd3eb4471d][Demeter]] in the [[id:f406d5c7-da94-4bf4-85e4-ae5aeffb4715][Mizuchi]]
system. Along with Wolfe’s favourite – if that’s the right word –
these stand as horrific monuments to our darker natures.”

“Lost generation ships rarely carry survivors, but that was the case
with the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]], whose people now occupy an outpost on [[id:240cb7c7-e94f-46b8-bbda-021a0d0ea538][Upaniklis B
3]]. So perhaps more living relics are still adrift in the void, waiting
to complete centuries-long missions.”
