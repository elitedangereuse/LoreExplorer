A growing colony that formally joined the Alliance in 3278. Many of
the local corporations are now subsidiaries of [[id:36b937d8-9325-4e59-99ad-95297ac99bd2][Wreaken Construction and Mining]].

The [[id:6be57ee8-1d53-4dfb-b349-6dcdca41462f][Wings of the Void]] were originally a group established to unify
pilots within populated space. Now, in addition to that, the Wings aim
to help new pilots learn about the workings of the galaxy, and try to
maintain peace and contentment wherever they hold power.
