* Freelance Report: Fresh Fruit Meets Bitter Harvest

/07 Jun 3302/

Speaking from the Canonn Interstellar Research Institute, Dr Arcanonn has commented on the current state of barnacle research and lauded the discovery of harvesting sites in the California Nebula: 

"Once again, the efforts of an independent explorer have resulted in an exciting discovery. Thanks to Commander Wobblytickle's report from California Sector DL-Y D4 C6, the long-suspected presence of barnacles in the California Nebula has now been confirmed." 

But Dr Arcanonn's tone grew notably cooler when speaking about the barnacles of the Pleiades Nebula: 

"The loss of several barnacles – whether through destruction or exhaustion – is naturally of concern to those of us investigating this enigma."
