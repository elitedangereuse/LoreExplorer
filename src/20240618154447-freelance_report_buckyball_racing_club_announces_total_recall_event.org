* Freelance Report: Buckyball Racing Club Announces Total Recall Event

/30 Mar 3302/

The Buckyball Racing club has announced that it is hosting a ship and buggy race called 'Total Recall'. The event is being funded by a major manufacturer of SRV tyres in exchange for data on high-speed vehicle handling on a variety of planet surfaces. 

Following observations that their tyres do not appear to leave tracks, a spokesperson for the company said: "We've been investigating this anomaly for some time. With the data provided by the BRC, we plan to start developing the next generation of high-performance 'TrakMark' tyres very soon". 

The event will run out of Schneider Relay in the [[id:d40886f3-bc59-4f0d-8926-b125ee01c9bb][Epsilon Indi]] system from the 2nd to the 10th of April 3302.
