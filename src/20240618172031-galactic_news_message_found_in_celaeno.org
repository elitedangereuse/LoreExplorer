* Galactic News: Message Found in Celaeno

/14 Nov 3303/

A number of news feeds have reported the discovery of an intriguing message in the Celaeno system. The message, which was recovered from a listening post, apparently contains an emergency broadcast from the Aida, a Hogan-class cargo vessel. 

The precise nature of the message has not been confirmed, and it is not known if security forces in Celaeno have investigated the issue.
