A mystery outbreak began on [[id:263e7f7f-de27-4fac-a4a0-37296a08f5f3][Newton Dock]] in BD-02 4304 in
June 3301. The disease, which came to be known as the Cerberus Plague,
soon spread to the neighbouring [[id:ba9787a7-583f-4fb0-b9e1-3c0c0096b485][Bast]], [[id:2d918da2-0f9c-4c37-a07f-5b1446c91258][Una]], [[id:3ae6db64-80df-42a5-8367-23c0ce0576e7][Santjalan]], [[id:a6410be1-99d2-4e1f-924b-4ec4dca8dfe9][Bastes]], [[id:68089c1e-578f-4f8a-9c0d-7417a55013ee][Maheou
Ti]] and [[id:641d5a2f-9417-469c-a004-c9588ca558e8][Ochoeng]] systems. A breakthrough was made in July when a cure
was found.
