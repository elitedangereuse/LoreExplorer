* Containing the Contagion

/26 Feb 3301/

Tensions have been running high aboard Effinger Port this week as doctors, nurses and scientists worked around the clock to find a cure for the Volungu [[id:1cffca4e-480b-46bf-b6c5-0af48c7292d3][Blight]]. 

A breakthrough finally occurred on Wednesday night after medical staff supplied by [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] managed to identify the pathogen behind the [[id:1cffca4e-480b-46bf-b6c5-0af48c7292d3][Blight]]. Once that was done, doctors were able to develop a course of treatment to fully eradicate all traces of the disease from patientsâ€™ bodies. 

While the cure comes too late for the thousands of families in Volungu, Furbaide, [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]] and [[id:c7e9e317-97fb-453b-bd7a-a52a61b5cafa][LHS 3505]] that lost loved ones over the last week, the news doubtlessly comes as quite a relief to the hundreds of thousands more who are currently waiting to receive the cure aboard their local stations.
