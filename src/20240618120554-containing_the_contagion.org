* Containing the Contagion

/26 Feb 3301/

Tensions have been running high aboard Effinger Port this week as doctors, nurses and scientists worked around the clock to find a cure for the Volungu Blight. 

A breakthrough finally occurred on Wednesday night after medical staff supplied by [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] managed to identify the pathogen behind the Blight. Once that was done, doctors were able to develop a course of treatment to fully eradicate all traces of the disease from patientsâ€™ bodies. 

While the cure comes too late for the thousands of families in Volungu, Furbaide, Liaedin and LHS 3505 that lost loved ones over the last week, the news doubtlessly comes as quite a relief to the hundreds of thousands more who are currently waiting to receive the cure aboard their local stations.
