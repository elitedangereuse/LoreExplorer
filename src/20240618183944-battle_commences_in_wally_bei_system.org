* Battle Commences in Wally Bei System

/13 Dec 3304/

Conflict has erupted between two opposing factions in the Wally Bei system. 

Hostilities were triggered after Wally Bei Technical claimed to have discovered stolen food shipments aboard their rival’s transport vessels. The faction’s spokesperson said: 

“Robbing innocent people of vital supplies is nothing less than an act of war, and we are treating it as such.” 

This was denied in an official response by Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party : 

“This outrageous accusation is intended to drive off our trade partners and damage our economy. We won’t tolerate such slander!” 

Military leaders from both Wally Bei Technical and the Traditional Wally Bei Constitution Party have issued calls to independent combat pilots, offering rewards for their support. 

The two factions have set out week-long operations that will begin on the 13th of December 3304.
