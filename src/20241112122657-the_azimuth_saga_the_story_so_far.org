* The Azimuth Saga

[[file:img/salvation/azimuth_banner.png]]

Greetings Commanders, and welcome to the *Azimuth Saga*! Many of you
will have caught wind of the various machinations of Aegis, Salvation,
and other factions or individuals in recent times. This post will
summarise these events as they unfold, so if you've missed anything or
want to get involved, here's where to catch up!

For a more concise summary of the story, consider reading parts one
through five of the [[https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/galnet/azimuth-historical-perspective-part-one][/Azimuth: A Historical Perspective/]] series.

** PROLOGUE

OCT, 3306 - A Pilot's Federation Alert is issued, announcing the
discovery of an abandoned megaship in the Chukchan system. Identified as
the Adamastor, it appears that the vessel has returned on autopilot
after setting out two centuries prior.

An excerpt from an Alliance Salvage Guild specialist's report:

#+begin_quote
The Adamastor has been travelling at sublight speed through
interstellar space for nearly two hundred years. There are no remains of
the crew. All escape pods and secondary craft have been launched, and
several airlocks were manually opened from within. A complete absence of
identification suggests that this ship was intended for clandestine
operations. All data drives have been deliberately erased.
#+end_quote

A private investigator from Wallglass Investigations Agency uncovers
further information about the Adamastor:

#+begin_quote
I convinced the Alliance Salvage Guild to pass on some serial numbers
that they discovered inside the Adamastor. Then I started scouring
databases, interviewing sources and, well, doing my old job. The
megaship was owned by a corporation called Azimuth Biochemicals. This
was taken over by a similar company called Pharmasapien, but both were
liquidated long ago. No mission records exist, but service crew reports
mention that the Adamastor's passengers included scientists, engineers
and some kind of military. Eventually I unearthed a flight plan, logged
in October 3111. It plotted a course toward Barnard's Loop with fuel for
approximately 370 light years, and was scheduled to pass by the HIP
39748 and HIP 33386 systems. I'm way too old to head out there myself,
but l hope someone can use this info, and help satisfy my curiosity
about what happened all those years ago.
#+end_quote

NOV, 3306 - Data from the Adamastor reveals the presence of precious
meta-alloy sources in the Coalsack Nebula. The /Alliance Assembly/
announces an expedition to the Coalsack Nebula to secure the resources.
To do so, they recruit the help of pilots and successfully establish
outposts in the area to defend against potential Thargoid attacks.
Shortly after, they begin working with Sirius Atmospherics, a
subsidiary of Sirius Corporation to terraform ammonia worlds in the
region. 

DEC, 3306 - Thargoids launch coordinated attacks on the Coalsack and
Witch Head nebulas, leading to urgent calls for assistance. Admiral Aden
Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, made this announcement:

#+begin_quote
This is a resurgence of Thargoid activity on a scale that we have not
witnessed for a long time. Unfortunately, drastic reductions in funding
and resources mean that Aegis is unable to provide adequate defensive
measures.
#+end_quote

JAN, 3307 - As a coalition of all three Galactic Superpowers, Aegis
appeals to the Empire, Federation, and Alliance to set aside internal
conflicts to offer adequate focus on the Thargoid threat. Professor Alba
Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, gave this statement:

#+begin_quote
Humanity's focus on petty internal conflicts has blinded us to the
existential threat of the Thargoids. Their recent horrific attacks
should be a wake-up call to the fact that defunding has crippled Aegis's
ability to offer protection. We strongly entreat our founders to come
together and channel resources toward Aegis, and particularly into
research. There can be no hope of coexistence with this alien species
unless we increase our understanding of them.

** ACT I

APR, 3307 - The /Adamastor/ "awakens" and begins transmitting a signal,
drawing the interest of the /Alliance Salvage Guild./ An anonymous
source known only as "/Salvation/" implores independent Commanders to
help decode the /Adamastor's/ message and provides a decryption key.
They claim it will lead to advanced scientific knowledge. Commanders
around the galaxy answer the call and identify the co-ordinates of a
sister-ship, the derelict /*Hesperus*/. When pilots arrive at an
asteroid belt around the second star of the *Perseus Dark Region KC-V
C2-2* system, they find that the twin megaship has already been claimed
by the /Scriveners/, a /Dredger Clan/. /Francesca Wolfe/ of /Wallglass
Investigations Agency/ gave some insight:

#+begin_quote
The Scriveners Clan was originally a fleet of research vessels for a
long-forgotten academic consortium. Over centuries they became a
self-sufficient society, constantly acquiring materials and information.
They're not aggressive, but shun outsiders and jealously guard their
‘Knowledge Core'. I'm fascinated by mentions of research-sergeants and
lector-generals, suggesting their culture is a merger of scholastic and
military. With the Hesperus claimed as salvage by the Scriveners and its
drives stripped, all chance of learning more was lost. Luckily, four
encoded data files had resisted upload, and a gap in the dredger's
antiquated firewalls allowed pilots to hack them.
#+end_quote

Elsewhere, Aegis launches a new anti-xeno research programme and
requests Commanders for aid in delivering Guardian technology. Professor
Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis Research, gave this statement:

#+begin_quote
At the Galactic Summit, Aegis agreed to undertake a fresh analysis of
Guardian technology. The hope is that this will lead to the development
of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require
new samples to compare with Ram Tah's groundbreaking work on this
mysterious species./ [...] /I beseech the galactic community to support
this project. It is vital that Aegis continues to receive funding, and
to achieve this we must push the boundaries of our knowledge even
further.
#+end_quote

Aegis are overwhelmingly successful in their initiative, receiving a
massive delivery of Guardian artefacts. Professor Alba Tesreau made this
announcement:

#+begin_quote
Everyone at Aegis is thankful for the impressive effort made by the
galactic community. If we can gain new insights into Guardian technology
from these samples, then funding and resources for our work may
continue.
#+end_quote

** ACT II

MAY, 3307 - Salvation sends another message to pilots, requesting they
deliver any logs scanned from the Hesperus to Taurus Mining Ventures at
the Hind Mine base in T Tauri system. Patience Middleton, a
representative of the corporation, announced:

#+begin_quote
‘Salvation' has authorised us to offer two million credits or ten
units of void opals for delivering the Hesperus's logs. This contract
ends on the 21st of May 3307, after which payments will not be
available. We have been asked to relay the message below:

This is Salvation. I call myself this as I cannot yet reveal my
identity, but my scientific breakthroughs will literally save all of
humanity. The Adamastor and the Hesperus were just the beginning, as I
have always known. For my intrepid agents, there will be further work to
come.
#+end_quote

Thargoids attack en masse, targeting the Delphi system and several
others among the California, Coalsack and Pleiades nebulas. It's
speculated that Aegis (based in Delphi) gathering Guardian artefacts
provoked the incursion. The Aegis owned Alexandria megaship jumps from
Delphi to HIP 16538, carrying a large quantity of Guardian artefacts and
is pursued by Thargoids. The Federation refuses the megaship entry into
Federation space, despite the planned route to Sol.

JUN, 3307 - Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria,
outlines the Alexandria's next steps:

#+begin_quote
On Thursday we will make a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system.
Since this has a small population, the risk of casualties will be low if
the Thargoids continue to pursue us. Once there, we will arrange to
offload our cargo and distribute it to multiple locations.
#+end_quote

However, the megaship never reached its arrival point and all
communication with it has ceased. Search teams in local systems have not
detected its presence. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with
Aegis, informed the media:

#+begin_quote
We regret to announce a complete loss of contact with the Alexandria.
Although there is no evidence of damage or destruction, its
disappearance while travelling through hyperspace raises the possibility
that it was intercepted en route by Thargoid forces. Captain Jacob
Morales and over four thousand crew members will be listed as missing,
presumed dead. In addition to this great tragedy, Aegis's research
programme into Guardian technology has been severely impacted by the
loss of many precious artefacts.
#+end_quote

Salvation emerges once again and contacts any pilots passing through the
Chukchan and Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system. Commander Tyler
Thorsen told Vox Galactica:

#+begin_quote
I was taking some sightseers on a trip round the Hesperus, and getting
as close as I dared to the Scriveners Clan dredger. I scanned the
tourist beacon for them, and suddenly received a direct message from
this ‘Salvation' guy. He asked me to track down some old signal beacons,
which are listening posts configured to retransmit long-range comms.
Apparently these could help locate the survivors from the megaship. But
the Hesperus is ancient history. Surely there can't be anything or
anyone left to find?
#+end_quote

The Pilot's Federation issues an official warning to all Commanders,
cautioning them against undertaking tasks for a potentially illegal
enterprise.

A Guardian/Thargoid battlefield is discovered at the end of a series of
signal beacons tracked by independent pilots, following Salvation's
instruction. Both Aegis and Taurus Mining Ventures lay claim to the
site, requesting delivery of any Guardian artefacts to the [[id:986145c8-a47e-4965-aadc-e0269b764ac5][PMD2009 48]]
system.

JUL, 3307 - The Glorious Prospect megaship, contracted by Salvation,
receives the vast majority of delivered artefacts and rewards pilots
with a specially engineered Class 2 Fixed Guardian Shard Cannon. The
Pilot's Federation declares these modules as "hot", requiring additional
costs to clean them prior to installation.

** ACT III

JUL, 3307 - The Scriveners clan Dredger leaves the system where the
Hesperus is located. Erik Gunnarson of Wallglass Investigations Agency
speculates:

#+begin_quote
When the Scriveners laid claim to the Hesperus, I expected only a
cloud of fragments would remain. But their salvage operation has been
prematurely abandoned, after stripping the megaship's innards and
leaving behind a mostly intact hull. Why have they done this? Perhaps
because this particular dredger clan avoids outsiders./ [...]
/Alternatively, the Scriveners detected richer pickings elsewhere --
either fresh resources for the dredger to consume or new information for
their ‘Knowledge Core'. In theory they could still be tracked down as
their vessel's hyperdrive has a similar range to modern-day fleet
carriers.
#+end_quote

Aegis is partly suspended as an inquiry into the disappearance of the
Alexandria megaship goes underway. While the Alliance, Empire and
Federation jointly ordered the inquiry, they maintain that Aegis plays a
vital defensive role against the Thargoids.

Independent pilots supported the Far God cult by delivering commodities
to the Panjabell system, including auto fabricators, emergency power
cells and insulating membrane. It's believed these will be used to
outfit megaships "the Perdition" and "the Sacrosanct" due to be
populated by the Thargoid-worshipping cultists. Earlier in the month,
Wallglass Investigations Agency examined the cult in a GalNet article.

AUG, 3307 - The Far God cult megaship 'The Testament' embarks on a
voyage throughout the core systems to convert new followers.

#+begin_quote
The masses are deaf to the voice of the Far God. What you see as alien
monsters, we view as messengers from a very real multi-dimensional
being. The Testament will help us carry the word of Its imminent
arrival.

~ The Second Witness of the Seventieth Chapter
#+end_quote

The two remaining megaships, 'The Perdition' and 'The Sacrosanct' are
prepared for long-range journeys. It's believed they will take cultists
on a pilgrimage to the Far God.

Aegis are investigated by an independent board of inquiry to establish
the reason for its recent failures and several prominent figures within
the organisation resign.

#+begin_quote
We will be raising issues of culpability, specifically whether the
concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Alexandria directly led
to systems coming under Thargoid attack. Other incidents will be
reviewed to identify possible grounds for negligence.

~ Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the board of inquiry
#+end_quote

Shortly after, the findings of the report are leaked to journalists. Dr
Paul Baumann states that only the final report should be considered
official. In the meantime, Vox Galactical journalist Alexei Keel shared
the leaked versions contents:

#+begin_quote
The leaked files outline a pattern of poor internal organisation and
negligence. One claim is that Aegis accepted its heavy reliance on
independent pilots entering combat situations against the Thargoids.

A lack of technological breakthroughs since the first generation of AX
weaponry is also criticised. Professor Tesreau, who has since resigned,
is singled out for prioritising communication with the Thargoids rather
than developing quickly deployed defences.

Interview transcripts show that some Aegis personnel consider the
inquiry itself to be part of a larger agenda. A recurring claim is that
the superpowers directly contributed to Aegis's inefficiency by reducing
funding, and are now scapegoating Aegis management for a lack of
progress.
#+end_quote

A timer on the mysterious "Hyford's Cache" expires, releasing a message
that reveals the location of Oaken Point - an abandoned settlement in
the Pleiades. Independent pilots discover audio logs at that location
regarding a "Project Seraph" which sought to integrate a human pilot
with a Thargoid ship. Following the trail, pilots discover that a test
subject, "D-2" managed to escape with the help of someone working at
Oaken Point following a string of failures in the experiments. Further
logs make reference to "The Witch" and Azimuth.

#+begin_quote
Our timeframe is likely to be slashed, of course. I fear our limited
success is worth a few more years at best. The Witch will not be pleased
with the lack of tangible results, despite our initial progress.

Still, one must remain optimistic. Our understanding of Thargoid
interface mechanisms has improved considerably. Plenty of enhanced test
subjects remain in our care. Dr Tao is writing a paper discussing their
surgical procedures which should greatly benefit Azimuth's medtech
department.

~ Professor Thomas Dorne
#+end_quote

Beacons in HIP 26176 and Col 69 Sector JI-I c10-4 contain further
information, revealing a third beacon and ultimately access to a second
research location. Anyone searching for further information on Project
Seraph is encouraged to proceed with caution.

SEP, 3307 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon comments on the Aegis inquiry:

#+begin_quote
The greatest regret of my career is that I was unable to formalise the
Sirius Treaty at the Galactic Summit. This would have revolutionised
Aegis by providing the commitment and resources it deserves, sparing it
the indignity of a public inquiry.

The Nine Martyrs attacks prevented that historic occasion, of course,
but the Sirius Treaty itself remains viable. I'd be happy to ratify it
on behalf of the Alliance if we can convince the other signatories that
defending humanity from the Thargoid threat should be our utmost
priority.
#+end_quote

The anonymous figure known as Salvation claims that Thargoid forces will
attack the Cornsar system. The following message was received by all
major newsfeeds:

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. Authorities in the Cornsar system must evacuate the
local population immediately. I believe a Thargoid invasion of the
system is imminent. I became aware of this danger while developing a new
interstellar xeno-detection network, which will be far superior to Eagle
Eye. Although the network is not fully complete, we cannot dismiss this
report as a false reading. Cornsar must act now.
#+end_quote

Carter Armstrong, Aegis chief administrator has this to say:

#+begin_quote
Aegis cannot validate this claim. There is no indication of a Thargoid
presence in the vicinity, and Cornsar is too far from their known
territories to be a viable target. As most of our operations are
suspended due to the public inquiry, we cannot dedicate any resources to
investigate further.
#+end_quote

** ACT IV

SEP, 3307 - Thargoids attack the Cornsar system, devastating two
stations located in-system. Aegis, who didn't recogise Salvation's
warnings as legitimate, are unprepared and unable to respond. In
response, the Pilot's Federation call on all Commanders who are
available to help.

As the battle rages in Cornsar, the Thargoid ships unexpectedly withdraw
into Witchspace. Chadwick Port and Ito market sustain heavy damage as
evacuation, rescue and reparation initiatives go underway.

Crashed Thargoid vessels are discovered on bodies in the Cornsar system,
confirmed by Aegis' observation teams. However, no official explanation
is offered. Shortly after, Salvation claims credit for the Thargoid
retreat:

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. The Thargoid invasion of Cornsar has now been
repulsed, thanks to prototype anti-xeno weaponry that I have been
developing for some time. I have achieved what Aegis could not -- an
effective deterrent against the alien threat.
#+end_quote

Vox Galactica's freelance journalist Alexei Keel releases a special
report:

#+begin_quote
To deliver vital components for his mysterious anti-xeno weapon,
Salvation once again recruited independent pilots, directly messaging
those who had performed tasks for him before. However, this time a
counter-initiative was formed by those who did not trust his
motivations. It was also supported by believers in non-aggression
against the Thargoids, and others who feared that the weapon might
endanger Cornsar's population....

...Aegis is investigating the Cornsar incident, but with faith in that
organisation at an all-time low, individual Commanders are now taking
matters into their own hands. Time will tell if Salvation's ambition to
replace Aegis is a noble goal, or if we are replacing the devil we know
with a darker demon.
#+end_quote

Salvation goes on to contact players who supplied "Basic Medicines" to
Cornsar and invites them to the Mbooni system. A Megaship located there
has a Tech Broken contact who provides pilots who seek them uniquely
engineered Anti-Xeno combat weapons.

** ACT V

OCT, 3307 - A large number of Thargoid ships invade the Pleiades, Witch
Head, Calnifornia and Coalsack nebulae. Thousands of casualties are
estimated while Aegis are unable to assist:

/"...the Baumann Report has tied our hands"

~ Admiral Aden Tanner/

The Taurus Mining Ventures megaship, Bright Sentinel moves to the Merope
system at Salvations request. Tech brokers on board offer
Guardian-hybrid plasma chargers at discount to support the anti-xeno
effort.

NOV, 3307 - Aegis Admiral, Aden Tanner called for the organisatin to
reject the public inquiry's shutdown and take action against Salvation.
He cites the distribution of unlicensed weapons technology distribution
as being designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives.
Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures said that threats to gain
access to Hind Mine asteroid base had no legal standing. Aegis
leadership condemns Tanner's actions and order him to depart the T Tauri
system.

A long-lost research facility was discovered in the Snake Sector GW-W
c1-1 system following a distress signal picked up by a megaship forming
the Colonia Bridge. The source was later identified as Holloway
Bioscience Facility 15 on moon 5 b. The Holloway Bioscience Institute
refused to comment on rumours that the facility's original crew
encountered a previously unidentified life form.

A rogue Aegis Defense force initiates conflict with Taurus Mining
Ventures in the T Tauri system. The force, led by Admiral Aden Tanner is
helmed by the Musashi Megaship, contrary to orders from Aegis
leadership. However, some speculate that the Admiral has tacit support
from many members of the organisation. Taurus Mining Ventures declare
the attack illegal and claim it will jeopardise important work which is
in the galactic community's best interests. The conflict ends in Taurus
Mining Venture's favour and Admiral Tanner is held in custody with Aegis
internal security teams.

Admiral Aden Tanner and the crew of the Musashi megaship are placed on
trial for attacking Salvation's allies. He stands formally accused of
mutiny and unlawful military action. In face of dishonourable discharge
and lifetime imprisonment, Admiral Tanner claims the Salvation's
anti-xeno superweapon deployed in the Cornsar system has triggered an
increase in Thargoid attacks.

Vox Galactica feature a report from freelance war correspondent Ernest
Rios:

/"Multiple starports have been crippled by Thargoid attacks in recent
weeks, with anti-xeno squadrons struggling to protect them. Many
Commanders told me that this latest wave is proving unusually difficult
to repel, with a steady stream of reinforcements replacing those alien
vessels destroyed in battle."/

** ACT VI

DEC, 3307 - Commodore Morag Halloran becomes the new commanding officer
of Aegis' Musashi Megaship. Her first transmission from this post
acknowledges Salvation's anticipation of Thargoid attacks in the Maia,
Merope and Delphi systems and calls for deliveries of classified
experimental equipment. Commodore Halloran is one of hundreds of naval
officers to resign their commissions to offer their services to
Salvation in an effort to defeat the Thargoids. The experimental
equipment goes on to develop large-scale weapons according to Salvations
designs for disrupting Thargoid technology. The superweapons go on to
clear most Thargoid vessels from Delphia, Maia and Merope, reminiscent
of events in Cornsar:

#+begin_quote
This is Halloran. Operation Tri-hammer has concluded with a code
white-three-alpha. Estimated target destruction in Delphi is at 27%,
with full dispersal of 98% of remaining hostiles. Scans underway for
non-combatant disruption or casualties. Maia and Merope data to be
submitted immediately to central analytics.
#+end_quote

Meanwhile, the Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress, and Imperial Senate
acknowledge the loss of military personnel to Salvation's cause. While
efforts are made to prevent further losses, rumours abound that
concessions may include official support for Salvation's anti-xeno
activities.

The Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head nebulas continue to see an influx
of Thargoid vessels. Freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios reports
for Vox Galactica:

#+begin_quote
Over the last few months, Thargoid ships have appeared in over two
dozen populated systems including Shenve, Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-5 and
Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6. All are in the vicinity of nebulas, which
seem to be favoured by the Thargoids.

** ACT VII

JAN, 3308 - The independent inquiry into Aegis concludes with
recommendation to close the orginisation. Notably, the Baumann Report
does not mention Salvation or suggest a replacement for Aegis.

#+begin_quote
...the loss of the megaship Alexandria and the illegal attack against
Hind Mine are both catastrophes that could have been anticipated and
prevented. This board cannot in all conscience recommend any scenario
that might enable further loss of life in Aegis's name.

~ Dr Paul Baumann
#+end_quote

The Alliance, Empire and Federation accept the recommendation and shut
down Aegis permanently. To make up for the closure, the Empire dedicated
to an increased military budget for the Imperial Navy, the Federation
creates a new naval strike force and the Alliance Defence Force commits
to working with the Sirius Navy.

Xenological research laboratories set up by Professor Alba Tesreau will
now transfer their work to specialist departments in the Holloway
Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village
University.

The Aegis Megaship Alexendria is discovered in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0
system after vanishing seven months prior. According to witnesses, its
remains are scattered across the rings of planet 2 A and no Guardian
Relics or survivors are found.

#+begin_quote
We can now prove that the Alexandria's loss was not caused by
negligence, as claimed by the Baumann Report. In reality, the megaship
was snared in a trap laid by an organised quasi-military force.

Furthermore, Captain Morales discovered that the raiders worked for
someone they referred to as ‘the Witch'. That name was mentioned in logs
discovered at HIP 22460 regarding Project Seraph -- vile experiments
perpetrated by Azimuth researchers to install human test pilots into
Thargoid vessels.

This evidence suggests that Azimuth Biochemicals has survived in some
form over the last two hundred years, and remains focused on aggressive
xenological research. Aegis must be reinstated immediately to counter
this dangerous organisation before more lives are lost.

~ Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong on behalf of Aegis.
#+end_quote

FEB, 3308 - Shutdown procedures for Aegis go ahead despite the
organisation warning that Azimuth has returned. Conrad Sterling reported
on the situation for Vox Galactica:

#+begin_quote
We now know that the Alexandria megaship was targeted by a hostile
force that could be Azimuth Biochemicals, the 200-year-old corporation
which owned the Adamastor and Hesperus. In the face of this new
evidence, Aegis leaders have petitioned for it to be reinstated.
#+end_quote

The HIP 12314, Dan, and Nauni systems come under heavy Thargoid attack.
The Superpower's alternatives to Aegis are not yet formed so independent
pilot's are called to aid. Commodore Morag Halloran, now Salvation's
military coordinator, states that the most efficient use of their time
is further anti-xeno superweapon development rather than "small-scale
engagement".

The leader of Aegis formally petition the three superpowers to reform
the organisation in light of alternatives struggling to get off the
ground.

Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of Taurus Mining Venture's research division
states detection of unusual radioactive signatures in Synuefe CE-R c21-6
and their intent to perform an analysis of any mineable materials. They
go on to subcontract independent pilots to help gather the resources. An
independent journal, The Empirical, notes that the signatures have not
been verified by secondary sources.

Salvation receives further military support from each of the superpowers
in addition to assistance in intelligence, logistics and security:

#+begin_quote
Most of us are here because it feels like Salvation is the only one
taking the fight to the Thargoids. Now that Aegis is as good as gone,
he's our best hope for stopping these aliens before they wipe us all
out.

~ Lieutenant Andrew Jones, recent Salvation volunteer
#+end_quote

Overwhelming numbers of Thargoid vessels invade the Didio, Novas and
Sosong systems. With Aegis officially disbanded and the Imperial Navy,
Federal Navy and Alliance Defence Force unable to quickly mount a
defence, local factions send out emergency calls for assistance from
independent pilots.

MAY, 3308 - The invading Thargoid forces in the Didio, Novas and Sosong
systems have been completely repelled by Salvation.

Vox Galactica journalist Jade Sanderlyn published this account:

#+begin_quote
We've received confirmation from Commodore Morag Halloran that three
anti-xeno superweapons were activated in Didio, Novas and Sosong. This
caused the Thargoid fleets in all three systems to immediately withdraw
into hyperspace.
#+end_quote

The anonymous scientist Salvation has made a statement following his
latest success against the Thargoids.

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. The deployment of my anti-xeno superweapons in the
Didio, Novas and Sosong systems was highly effective, just as I
anticipated. Billions of lives were undoubtedly saved as a result.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Due to support from the Alliance, Empire and Federation, we have made a
major breakthrough in utilising Guardian-based technology. Construction
of the next generation of superweapons has already begun. These will
allow us to deliver a truly overwhelming strike against the Thargoid
species.
#+end_quote

However, an abandoned outpost in the DG Canum Venaticorum system could
reveal the true identity of the anonymous figure Salvation.

Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, made a public
announcement:

#+begin_quote
An untraceable source pointed me to the DG Canum Venaticorum system
with the question: Who is Salvation? A unique detail caught my
attention, so I requested verification from pilots who had supported
Aegis. We found a previously undiscovered research outpost once
controlled by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
I believe these logs may finally reveal Salvation's real name and
background. I urge the superpowers to halt their collaboration with
Salvation while this new data is verified.
#+end_quote

JUNE, 3308 - The tide begins to turn on Salvation as the "truth" is
revealed

Claims that Salvation was once a senior member of Azimuth Biochemicals
who worked for INRA have led to a public outcry.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling reported on these developments for
Vox Galactica:

#+begin_quote
Information recently uncovered in the DG Canum Venaticorum system has
been presented by Professor Alba Tesreau. It suggests that Salvation's
real name is Dr Caleb Wycherley, former vice-president of research at
Azimuth Biochemicals. According to Wycherley's personal logs, his team
contributed to the development of the controversial mycoid bioweapon
deployed by INRA during the First Thargoid War.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Wycherley's logs also provide evidence that he gained the nickname of
‘The Witch'. This figure has been implicated in the murderous attack on
the Alexandria megaship in June 3307 and in Project Seraph recordings
found in the HIP 26176 and HIP 22460 systems.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Former Aegis leadership has demanded that Salvation be arrested and
questioned over his involvement in these events, and that superpower
fleet support for Salvation's work be suspended until such questions
have been answered.
#+end_quote

The details of the INRA base were revealed by a victim of project SERAPH
where living subjects were grafted to Thargoid technology against their
will.

#+begin_quote
Most of these horrific experiments ended in failure or death, but the
subject classified as D-2 escaped from Oaken Point by stowing away on a
trader's ship. Since then she has used her inside knowledge to
investigate Azimuth, confirming Aegis's belief that the corporation is
still active.
#+end_quote

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have responded coolly to accusations
that Salvation has hidden links to Azimuth Biochemicals and INRA.

#+begin_quote
Salvation has always been a contentious figure, and the logs found in
the DG Canum Venaticorum system have polarised public opinion further.
Some are enraged that Salvation may have history with INRA or be
responsible for the loss of the Alexandria. Others believe Aegis's
claims to be false, a desperate attempt to save themselves.
#+end_quote

Salvation has announced that his partner organisation Taurus Mining
Ventures is a modern incarnation of Azimuth Biochemicals.

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. In light of recent speculation, we are rebranding
[[id:5d339d87-3edb-4938-984a-49708bf6b65f][Taurus Mining Ventures]] as Azimuth Biotech. My intent is to prove that
Azimuth has no further need to conceal its operations.
#+end_quote

The Alliance, Empire and Federation will continue collaborating with
Salvation and Azimuth Biotech on anti-xeno operations.

#+begin_quote
We now know the truth: Azimuth not only survived, but was responsible
for many controversial activities. It contributed to the mycoid virus's
development, coordinated with Black Flight and oversaw Project Seraph.
Now, this notorious organisation enjoys the trust of all three
superpowers to eliminate the Thargoid threat.
#+end_quote

Salvation declares that HIP 22460 will be the stages for a decisive
strike against the Thargoids:

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. Construction of the Proteus Wave has officially
commenced. This version of my anti-xeno superweapon has been designed to
bring absolute victory against our adversaries.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
HIP 22460 will serve as the final battlefield in the Thargoid war. As
with previous superweapons, we anticipate that the Guardian-based
technology incorporated within the Proteus Wave will once again attract
the Thargoids. However, this time it will eradicate the alien threat not
just from the system, but from the entire galaxy.
#+end_quote

A coalition of independent Commanders has been formed to destabilise
Salvation's anti-xeno organisation. They take action to slow the
progress of Azimuth Biotech in "Operation: Wych Hunt".

JULY, 3308 - Azimuth Biotech move into HIP 22460 and begin construction
of the Proteus Wave superweapon.

Azimuth Biotech's operation in HIP 22460 is publicly denounced by the
Far God cult. Meanwhile, Azimuth Biotech urgently requests deliveries of
Guardian Artefacts to the system as vital components of the Proteus Wave
superweapon. Artefacts are delivered en-masse, and shipments are
rewarded from the Heart of Taurus.

HIP 22460 is invaded by large numbers of Thargoid vessels. A ferocious
battle ensues between the invaders and naval/independent craft. A call
for reinforcements is met with strong support from prominent figures
throughout populated space while others voice their distrust.

New Federal and Imperial capital ships have arrive in HIP 22460 as
Azimuth Biotech's operation nears its conclusion. The following message
is provided to all newsfeeds for public broadcast:

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. The Proteus Wave's core mechanism will be fully
constructed one week from today. We will then begin integration with the
surface site on HIP 22460 10b, using designs of mine which are unique to
the superweapon's operation.
#+end_quote

A counter-statement regarding Azimuth Biotech is published by Professor
Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis:

#+begin_quote
The recent declaration by Director Torben Rademaker paints a false
picture of those pilots who are actively working against Azimuth
Biotech. He frames them as criminals and alien sympathisers, betraying
humanity to the Thargoids. This could not be any further from the truth.
It is Azimuth's own inhumanity that they are fighting against.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
It's unsurprising that Salvation's focus is now on HIP 22460, given
this system has long been part of Azimuth's sinister legacy. On planet
7c is the abandoned settlement Fort Asch, where unlicensed scientists
performed monstrous experiments to link human minds with Thargoid
vessels. We know from Project Seraph's sole survivor, known as Subject
D-2, how brutal the results were.
#+end_quote

Salvation declares that the Proteus Wave is complete:

#+begin_quote
This is Salvation. The core mechanism of the Proteus Wave is now fully
assembled. Under my guidance, specialists are performing checks at the
selected site on HIP 22460 10 b. Additional power capacitors are also
being installed to improve energy transfer management.
#+end_quote

AUGUST, 3308 - The Proteus Wave superweapon is completed and Salvation
prepares to fire.

Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon is now complete and final preparations
are underway in the HIP 22460 system.Commodore Morag Halloran, Azimuth
Biotech's military coordinator, broadcast this announcement from the
Bright Sentinel megaship:

#+begin_quote
Salvation has confirmed that the Proteus Wave core mechanism is fully
active. Calibration inside the Thargoid structure on the surface of HIP
22460 10b has successfully concluded. Power sources derived from
Guardian designs are building to the required levels, and a final series
of safety checks are currently underway.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Upon detonation, the energy pulse generated by the Proteus Wave will
cause catastrophic disruption to all Thargoid biomechanical technology
within range. Every alien vessel in HIP 22460 will immediately cease to
function. Salvation predicts that the wide-ranging impact of the
superweapon will drive all Thargoids out of the core systems. In
practical terms, tomorrow will be their doomsday.
