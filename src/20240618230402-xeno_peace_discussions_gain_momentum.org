* ‘Xeno-Peace’ Discussions Gain Momentum

/06 Sep 3308/

Public debate around the Battle of HIP 22460 has seen the emergence of a grassroots movement that promotes communication with the Thargoids. 

As militaries prepare for a protracted anti-xeno conflict, this alternative viewpoint has gained traction on social channels in multiple systems. Proponents believe that their governments should focus on finding ways to open a dialogue with the Thargoid species, and end hostilities using diplomatic means. 

On Interstellar Communal Experience ([[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE]]) platforms, some influential names have amplified the xeno-peace concept. In a recent ICE-cast, leading caster Joy Senne openly discussed the topic with her viewers: 

“How do you end a war? Is it by fighting harder, building bigger weapons, wiping out everyone you can? No! Well, sometimes, I guess. But I guess [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] blew that one, right? We shouldn’t just accept what our leaders are telling us – that the only way to end the Thargoid war is through military action.”  

“So if you want peace, you learn to talk to the other side and find common ground. That’s why I’m fascinated by this Thargoid Advocacy Project, which is promoting ways to resolve this terrible situation through non-violent means. Millions of people have already signed up. What do you all think?” 

The movement has received minor coverage in most newsfeeds. However, The Sovereign, which reports on events in independent systems, has dedicated several segments to the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Deputy editor Heimar Borichev regularly discusses the topic in his editorials: 

“Pro-peacers are being ridiculed for wanting to talk to the aliens rather than shoot them. The experts claim it’s a waste of research trying to communicate with Thargoids. But better facts are out there. Listen to what Professor Tesreau has always said between the lines. Seek out theories that weren’t approved by your governments. Make up your own mind.” 

In the Federation, a spokesperson for the Proactive Detection Bureau remarked: 

“An increase in pro-xeno sentiment has been flagged by our algorithms, since such messages often include markers for potentially antisocial behaviour. There is currently no evidence that this is anything other than a countercultural social phenomenon, but our operatives are monitoring the situation.”
