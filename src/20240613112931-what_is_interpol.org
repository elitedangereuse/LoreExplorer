[[id:68be64ca-8477-4be5-b2c6-2d4ca90a1ade][Interpol]] provides multi-jurisdictional investigation. particularly
across Alliance worlds, but also when an investigation strays
beyond. In addition it provides support assets for individual Alliance
forces when heavy backup is required.

Internal affairs investigations for [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][Alliance]] organisations are also
conducted by Interpol and upon request for member systems too.

Numerically, Interpol is smaller than most systems police forces, but
is well trained, well equipped and well respected, Interpol also acts
as a direct intervention force on behalf of the Assembly.

It is named after a long defunct organisation dating back more than a
millennium from Earth.
