Interpol provides multi-jurisdictional investigation. particularly across Alliance worlds, but also when an investigation strays beyond. In addition it provides support assets for individual Alliance forces when heavy backup is required. / Internal affairs investigations for Alliance organisations are also conducted by Interpol and upon request for member systems too. / Numerically, Interpol is smaller than most systems police forces, but is well trained, well equipped and well respected, Interpol also acts as a direct intervention force on behalf of the Assembly. / It is named after a long defunct organisation dating back more than a millennium from Earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
