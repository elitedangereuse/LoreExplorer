* Week in Review

/29 Dec 3304/

Here are this week’s main stories. 

Federal Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] has appointed Isolde Rochester as the deputy leader of the Federation’s Liberal Party. The new Shadow Vice President is the matriarch of the powerful Rochester family, which includes the CEO of Core Dynamics and two Federal Navy officers. Vice President Rochester said she was honoured to accept the position. 

Imperial senators supporting the isolationist group Nova Imperium have demanded that Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] acknowledge its figurehead, Hadrian Augustus Duval. Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] responded by saying that Nova Imperium was a fringe organisation with no right to determine policy. The Emperor’s lack of response has led to accusations of weakness, with many calling on her to step down. 

In other news, Simguru [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] has claimed that the nanomedicines developed by Vitadyne Labs were in fact developed in Utopia. In a statement, Simguru said the nanomedicines were never intended for use outside of Utopia, and demanded their immediate return. 

The leaders of the Alliance and the Federation have commented on the rise of Nova Imperium. Alliance Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] said the unrest afflicting the Empire would be a concern if it affected inter-superpower cooperation, while Federal President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] said the Federation would be forced to intervene if Nova Imperium came to power and the Empire ceased contributions to Aegis. 

Meanwhile, the Federal Navy has requested a large shipment of Duradrive personal computers from manufacturer [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]. [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], the company’s CEO, said the request was a testament to the Duradrive’s reliability. Herculean has placed an open order for various commodities to fulfil the request. 

Finally, twin initiatives to supply Imperial senator Simone Leatrix’s festivities have reached a successful conclusion. As the campaigns drew to a close, Senator Leatrix said she hoped the sight of her glittering mountaintop retreat would serve as an inspiration amid the current civil disquiet. 

And those are the main stories this week.
