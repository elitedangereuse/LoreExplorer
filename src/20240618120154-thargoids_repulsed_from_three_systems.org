* Thargoids Repulsed from Three Systems

/14 Dec 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapons have cleared most Thargoid vessels from the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]], [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] and [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] systems. 

Pilots were asked to transport classified experimental equipment from the Heart of Taurus in the Qarato system to three other megaships owned by Taurus Mining Ventures. These components were used to prepare the large-scale weapons developed by [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] to affect Thargoid technology. 

Vox Galactica published an intercepted message from Commodore [[id:bcaa9222-b056-41cf-9361-68dd8d3424fb][Morag Halloran]], commanding officer of the Musashi, to the Bright Sentinel and Glorious Prospect megaships: 

“This is Halloran. Operation Tri-hammer has concluded with a code white-three-alpha. Estimated target destruction in [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] is at 27%, with full dispersal of 98% of remaining hostiles. Scans underway for non-combatant disruption or casualties. [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] and [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] data to be submitted immediately to central analytics.”  

Independent observers have reported that the majority of all Thargoid ships in the three systems have abruptly departed, with some wreckages found on planetary surfaces. This closely matches the event in the Cornsar system in September, when the anti-xeno superweapon was first deployed. 

Pilots are requested to help with repair and rescue efforts for starports damaged by the Thargoids: Donar’s Oak and The Oracle in the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] system, Obsidian Orbital in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system, and Reed’s Rest in the [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] system.
