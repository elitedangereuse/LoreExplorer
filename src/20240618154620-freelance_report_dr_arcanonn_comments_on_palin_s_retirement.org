* Freelance Report: [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] Comments on Palin's Retirement

/22 Apr 3302/

Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has expressed solidarity with Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]], following the latter's decision to retire from the Palin Institute and pursue personal research into the Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys. 

"It is unfortunate that the professor has been forced to make this decision, but given the existence of the 'dark forces' to which he refers, I support him wholeheartedly." 

"I have long been concerned that there are people out there with greater knowledge of the UAs and meta-alloys, and with darker intentions. The secretive convoys, Palin's abduction, the unexplained increases in the black market value of UAs, the purchase of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of meta-alloys at Obsidian Orbital, and the death threats I received â€“ all are troubling." 

"We mourn the fact that scientists feel the need to retreat to continue their work, but I look forward to visiting the professor on [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] A 3 a."
