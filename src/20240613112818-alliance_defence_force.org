* 0114 Alliance Defence Force
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

Barring the small Alliance Defence Force for defending key components
of the Alliance bureaucracy there is no central Alliance Navy to
compare with the other major powers. Instead a headquarters
organisation exists staffed by the Council of Admirals and their
support staff.

The Alliance Defence Force is essentially a small rapid deployment
force made up of ships from the member navies, and is maintained under
the command of the Council of Admirals to respond to any crisis -
humanitarian and military.

In an emergency additional forces would be provided by member navies
if the Council of Admirals makes an emergency appeal to the Assembly.
