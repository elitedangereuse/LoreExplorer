* 0170 Accidental Extinction
[[id:595aa273-d1b3-44fd-9f16-ddc7291b4bee][Delta Pavonis]]

In 2182, fragile indigenous life, still at an early stage of its
evolution, was discovered in the [[id:595aa273-d1b3-44fd-9f16-ddc7291b4bee][Delta Pavonis]] system and through a
bacteriological accident, completely wiped out in the same year. When
further alien ecologies were discovered in the [[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]] and [[id:144149ef-21cd-4e52-afea-dcf379d12d18][Altair]]
systems, and with the failure of the project to terraform [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]], it
looked like humanity would bring the cosmos to its knees, much as it
had managed to do to its own planet.
