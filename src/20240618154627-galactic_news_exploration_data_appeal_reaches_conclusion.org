* Galactic News: Exploration Data Appeal Reaches Conclusion

/05 May 3302/

The office of Jasmina Halsey has announced that the former president's appeal for exploration data has reached a successful conclusion. Although Halsey's claims of transcendent experiences have been dismissed by much of the political elite, the wider galactic community was more receptive, with hundreds of independent pilots taking to their ships to gather exploration data for Halsey's appeal. 

In the wake of the appeal's success, a member of Halsey's personal staff released a statement to the media: 

"On behalf of President Halsey, I would like to thank all those who supported this appeal. The data you submitted will now be analysed to determine if it can tell us more about the beings seen by President Halsey. With luck, this investigation will set us on a path to making contact with these extraordinary beings."
