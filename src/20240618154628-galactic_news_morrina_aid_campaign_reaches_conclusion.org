* Galactic News: Morrina Aid Campaign Reaches Conclusion

/05 May 3302/

The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has announced that its campaign to bring relief to the people of the Morrina system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a deluge of deliveries to Beaumont Dock. The medicines, water purifiers and power generators delivered to the station will now be distributed to those affected by the system's recent conflicts. 

Following the success of the campaign, a spokesperson for Spinward Marches Alliance Concern released a brief statement: 

"We would like to extend our sincere thanks to members of the Pilots Federation who gave so generously of their time and resources. Today marks the beginning of a brighter future for the people of Morrina. As the system stabilises, we will turn to the goals of terraforming Morrina 4 and establishing exploration outposts deep in the Orion Arm."
