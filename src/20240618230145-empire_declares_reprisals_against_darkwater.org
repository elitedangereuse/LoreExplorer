* Empire Declares Reprisals Against Darkwater

/17 Feb 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Darkwater Inc in the [[id:ba152f8a-d8af-4611-b8ac-0b32f3258dd0][Summerland]] system has been declared a hostile military target for its role in abducting Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]]. 

The private military firm, led by Colonel [[id:01f68135-e4ba-400b-856d-bd938dfd7cad][Ronan Brock]], was secretly hired by the Lords of Restoration to train and equip the NMLA. Darkwater troops also kept the Emperor imprisoned in a concealed bunker for over a year. 

Once their involvement was revealed by [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]], Darkwater’s forces regrouped around the megaship Pearl Mandate. Colonel Brock led an attempt to gain control of [[id:ba152f8a-d8af-4611-b8ac-0b32f3258dd0][Summerland]] as a defensive measure but was unsuccessful. The mercenaries have now been branded as wanted criminals by the system authorities. 

The order to strike against Darkwater came directly from Emperor Arissa: 

“I call upon my loyal servants and all other warriors of honour to wipe out this nest of traitors. We remember the innocent victims of the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] by punishing those who enabled them.” 

The [[id:ba152f8a-d8af-4611-b8ac-0b32f3258dd0][Summerland]] Patron’s Party will redeem combat bonds for destroyed Darkwater ships at the starport Henry O’Hare’s Hangar. Although the Summerland system is typically permit locked, the Empire has arranged a total exemption for independent pilots for a three-week period.  

To guarantee that Darkwater is thoroughly eliminated, the Empire is offering a range of incentives to pilots. These include awarding the rank of Master in the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, discounts on Imperial ships and weapons in the [[id:ba152f8a-d8af-4611-b8ac-0b32f3258dd0][Summerland]] system, and Imperial Hammer railguns for the ten pilots who achieve the most combat bonds.
