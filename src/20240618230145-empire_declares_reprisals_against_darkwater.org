* Empire Declares Reprisals Against Darkwater

/17 Feb 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Darkwater Inc in the Summerland system has been declared a hostile military target for its role in abducting Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. 

The private military firm, led by Colonel Ronan Brock, was secretly hired by the Lords of Restoration to train and equip the NMLA. Darkwater troops also kept the Emperor imprisoned in a concealed bunker for over a year. 

Once their involvement was revealed by ACT, Darkwater’s forces regrouped around the megaship Pearl Mandate. Colonel Brock led an attempt to gain control of Summerland as a defensive measure but was unsuccessful. The mercenaries have now been branded as wanted criminals by the system authorities. 

The order to strike against Darkwater came directly from Emperor Arissa: 

“I call upon my loyal servants and all other warriors of honour to wipe out this nest of traitors. We remember the innocent victims of the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] by punishing those who enabled them.” 

The Summerland Patron’s Party will redeem combat bonds for destroyed Darkwater ships at the starport Henry O’Hare’s Hangar. Although the Summerland system is typically permit locked, [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] has arranged a total exemption for independent pilots for a three-week period.  

To guarantee that Darkwater is thoroughly eliminated, [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] is offering a range of incentives to pilots. These include awarding the rank of Master in the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, discounts on Imperial ships and weapons in the Summerland system, and Imperial Hammer railguns for the ten pilots who achieve the most combat bonds.
