* Billionaire Wins Lottery

/17 Aug 3304/

Renowned billionaire [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]], owner of [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital
Investments]], has been confirmed as the winner of a lottery prize of
one billion credits.

[[id:c56b0f38-65be-4423-b9fe-9c1a19d4dcc1][Tori Theopolis]], a spokesperson for the [[id:fa5ec483-e38a-4608-b202-c1d00d68cfef][Federal Grand Lottery]], announced: 

“Our annual galactic jackpot has been claimed and the winning ticket
verified. Our congratulations to Mr Rackham – we hope he enjoys his
billion-credit prize.”

Zachary Rackham, known in some circles as ‘Calico Zack’, told the media: 

“To be honest, this caught me by surprise. I only buy lottery tickets
out of habit, a holdover from the days when I used to rattle around
space in a rusty old [[id:0127a175-4bb8-4bf7-924c-37273661a623][Sidewinder]]. Naturally I’ll be donating this
windfall to various charitable programmes.”

[[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]] published this observation from financial journalist
[[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]]:

“It’s highly suspicious that a billionaire should play the lottery,
and even more suspicious that he should win it. I’m sure that Calico
Zack’s accountants will indeed put this money to good use – paying the
gargantuan bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to his
company. Once a [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]], always a pirate.”
