* Billionaire Wins Lottery

/17 Aug 3304/

Renowned billionaire Zachary Rackham, owner of Rackham Capital Investments, has been confirmed as the winner of a lottery prize of one billion credits. 

Tori Theopolis, a spokesperson for the Federal Grand Lottery, announced: 

“Our annual galactic jackpot has been claimed and the winning ticket verified. Our congratulations to Mr Rackham – we hope he enjoys his billion-credit prize.” 

Zachary Rackham, known in some circles as ‘Calico Zack’, told the media: 

“To be honest, this caught me by surprise. I only buy lottery tickets out of habit, a holdover from the days when I used to rattle around space in a rusty old Sidewinder. Naturally I’ll be donating this windfall to various charitable programmes.” 

The Federal Times published this observation from financial journalist Bryanna Blanco: 

“It’s highly suspicious that a billionaire should play the lottery, and even more suspicious that he should win it. I’m sure that Calico Zack’s accountants will indeed put this money to good use – paying the gargantuan bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to his company. Once a pirate, always a pirate.”
