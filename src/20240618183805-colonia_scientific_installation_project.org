* Colonia Scientific Installation Project

/29 Jun 3304/

Scientists in Colonia have announced plans to build a scientific outpost in the system to monitor the region’s population and resources. 

Professor Alexei de la Vega, who is heading the project, published this statement: 

“Our recent study into the region’s population increase has revealed alarming statistics. If Colonia’s population continues to increase at the current rate it could lead to a serious depletion of resources at some point in the future.” 

“Monitoring infrastructure, terraforming, logistics and other issues will require the construction of a dedicated centre for resource management. This will allow us to study the aggregated data and formulate a structured solution to avoid potential problems.” 

The campaign is being run by Tir Technology Services, one of Colonia’s partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver commodities to Bolden’s Enterprise in the Tir system. 

The campaign begins on the 28th of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
