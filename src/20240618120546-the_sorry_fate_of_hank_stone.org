* The Sorry Fate of Hank Stone

/16 Feb 3301/

Residents of Toolfa Large were left in shock this weekend after local security services found a small fortune in raw gold sitting aboard what they presumed to be an abandoned Sidewinder in one of the station’s lower hangers. The ship’s records indicate that its owner, a Mr Hank Stone, had spent the last month alone in the LAWD 26 system, where he had found a previously untapped source of precious metals. 

After a brief investigation it was discovered that a Mr Hank Stone, of no fixed abode, has been found dead in his bunk at Toolfa Large Short Stay Inn several days beforehand.  

Mr Stone is believed to have passed away due to chronic liver failure, a state that was no doubt exasperated by the half dozen empty bottles of Eranin Pearl Whiskey that were found strewn about his cabin.
