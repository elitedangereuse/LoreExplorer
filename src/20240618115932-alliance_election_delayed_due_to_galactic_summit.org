* Alliance Election Delayed due to Galactic Summit

/01 Feb 3307/

The Alliance Assembly has agreed to delay electing a new prime minister to avoid clashing with the forthcoming Galactic Summit. 

The proposal to postpone the election date came from Prime Minister Edmund Mahon: 

“Now that the diplomatic conference has been confirmed, we must adapt to take advantage of this historic event. A potential change in leadership occurring at the same time as the Galactic Summit would cause confusion and undermine the Alliance’s presence.” 

Although Mahon’s proposal was voted through by a narrow margin, many council members disagreed with altering the political calendar. Councillor Nakato Kaine, who is a candidate in the election, declared: 

“It is outrageous that the prime minister is using this as an excuse to extend his term in office. Once again, he is more concerned with projecting the Alliance as a superpower than the interests of member systems. This behaviour is what you’d expect from a corrupt emperor or president, clinging onto power at any cost.” 

The Assembly has rescheduled the election to take place three months later in May 3307, although this remains only provisional.
