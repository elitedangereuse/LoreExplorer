[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][The Pilots Federation]] has existed for a very long time. It was founded
in 2805 during the great surge of private ownership of small starships
enabled by the hugely competitive modular ship designs made available
during the previous decades.

It was founded as much as a way of agreeing prices for ship parts en
masse (where member benefit from group discounts), but soon becane
much more, providing a system where trusted pilots could share route
information and protect each other from a new scourge - also enabled
ny the proliferation of small starships - of interstellar piracy. Over
the years an unofficial tally of pirate kills amongst some members
began as 'bragging rights' but soon members started showing their
kills on their online IDs, and before long those without such a rating
were referred to as 'Harmless' - and by implication not so desirable
to provide cover on a route known for pirate attacks.

Gradually, the Pilots Federation grew to encompass a great many
pilot-owners and their ships. It also provided an element of
respectability as the itinerant nature of their lifestyles had started
to bring suspicion amongst planet-siders - where the lack of
accountability of space farers brought about by their ability to
simply move on to a different system before the law caught up with
them gave them a bit of a reputation as cowboys or as thieves in
certain places. The Pilots Federation would not tolerate dishonourable
behaviour among its members, and so such members would wear the PF's
logo with pride - earning them a little respect in their dealings, and
an antidote to the cowboy image.
