* 0145 Terraforming
[[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]]

The Emperor's passion for the arts and very high standards of living
saw a rapid population increase in Imperial systems. Massive migration
from independent, [[id:c71d963e-1933-4701-bb5a-d2a4332125c5][Galcop]] and Federation worlds saw an accompanying
increase in prosperity.

To deal with the rapid rise in population across many worlds, the
Empire began terraforming of Cemiess 2 in 3080. This put paid to
Federal ambitions in the system. A colonial charter had been
established since 3055, but lack of funds had prevented any
expansion. The act of approving the Imperial settlement proved to be
the last of [[id:3b5b7101-a735-4d40-a48e-215cdcf06a27][Gaylen Trasken Duval]] who dies shortly afterwards, he was
109 years of age.
