Emperor Hengist Duval Attacked During Wedding 
 
The city is in a state of shock following news that the Emperor was attacked by a high-ranking official during the wedding ceremony. 

Details of the attack are scant at the moment as a total comms blackout was imposed throughout the immediate area following the incident. One of our sources has indicated that the assailant was killed, but that he managed to injure the Emperor before he died. We do not know how serious the Emperorâ€™s injuries are, but our hope is that he makes a swift recovery. 

Along the route of the procession, millions of citizens and slaves who had been celebrating the grand occasion wait in stunned silence for news of their beloved Emperor. We wait with them.
