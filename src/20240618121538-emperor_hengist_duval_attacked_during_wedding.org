* Emperor Hengist Duval Attacked During Wedding

/05 Aug 3301/

Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] Attacked During Wedding
 
The city is in a state of shock following news that the Emperor was
attacked by a high-ranking official during the wedding ceremony.

Details of the attack are scant at the moment as a total comms
blackout was imposed throughout the immediate area following the
incident. One of our sources has indicated that the assailant was
killed, but that he managed to injure the Emperor before he died. We
do not know how serious the Emperorâ€™s injuries are, but our hope is
that he makes a swift recovery.

Along the route of the procession, millions of citizens and slaves who
had been celebrating the grand occasion wait in stunned silence for
news of their beloved Emperor. We wait with them.
