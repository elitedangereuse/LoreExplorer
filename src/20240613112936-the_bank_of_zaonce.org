* 0243 The [[id:e9439fe0-8637-4330-b5fd-b4f1643cf472][Bank of Zaonce]]
[[id:66127aeb-8fbf-4c1c-b0a7-5f4c7425a5db][Zaonce]]  

Early in Zaonce's colonial history, in 2682, a former Federation
banking executive named [[id:9a2d42df-cc68-47fa-bdf0-5a71d3801d12][Herschel Derrey]] moved to the colony and set up
a family banking business. He and his extended family spread their
usiness around the world in only a decade and by 2693 they had earned
a reputation as a level headed and reliable financial
establishment. Derrey's daughter [[id:a4917d52-3e9f-4c58-b89a-30dba1252ec5][Emily]] brokered a loan on an
undiclosed but sizeable sum of credits to an up and coming spacecraft
manufacturer named [[id:6da1c424-2b8f-4612-9c68-415c9ce6aed7][Faulcon Manspace]] in exchange for stock options. Six
years later, when the [[id:369150fa-848e-401e-9ce6-373f1453e405][Viper]] was unveiled, profit rolled in and the
stock options for Faulcon Manspace suddenly became vastly profitable
to her family. Buoyed by this financial victory, Derrey took over
several other banking concerns on the world until his corporation was
the sole financial establishment on the planet, although operating
under different brands. They adopted the name [[id:e9439fe0-8637-4330-b5fd-b4f1643cf472][Bank of Zaonce]] in 2718.
