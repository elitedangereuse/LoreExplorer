* Thargoid War Bulletin: Two Active Titans Remain

/20 Aug 3310/

Titan Thor in the Col 285 Sector IG-O c6-5 system has been reported as destroyed, leaving only two of the eight Thargoid motherships still active. 

Aegis has begun a scientific analysis programme to investigate the hulks of all inactive Titans. A spokesperson told the media: 

“Xenologists from the Alliance, Empire and Federation are eagerly cooperating to study the Titans’ remains. Military teams are accompanying our research specialists as they seek to improve our understanding of Thargoid biotechnology.” 

“We are aware that some independent ships are already scavenging the debris, hoping to locate something of value. Aegis advises extreme caution to all pilots when approaching inactive Titans. The immediate area has been reported to be highly corrosive , and individual Thargoids may have survived deep within their motherships. We cannot discount defence mechanisms still being active, or even attacks from smaller Thargoid vessels.”
