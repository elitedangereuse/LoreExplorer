* Rumours Arise of New Alien Artefacts

/15 Aug 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Anecdotal reports suggest that a previously unknown non-human object has been discovered by independent pilots. 

No details about where or how the object was obtained have been established at this time. What little information exists has been provided by individual members of the Pilots’ Federation. 

One of these sources is a public message posted by Commander Marcus Mercer via an Interstellar Common Experience (ICE) network: 

“I recently met up with an old friend of mine. Let’s call her Digger. Years ago we’d team up to excavate Guardian and Thargoid artefacts. Sold them and split the profits. She mentioned having an ‘unusual find’ in her ship’s cargo hold, and invited me onboard to check it out.” 

“Standing there bathed in its light from the other side of the window, I knew this was something alien. But it wasn’t just another dusty relic from millennia ago. This looked newer, alive and glowing, giving off a vibration that made me feel queasy.” 

“Commander Kralone was the first to discover these objects, apparently. Digger said she’d worked out how to get hold of one and would tell me how – for a price. I joked that if Aegis was still around, it would have paid big credits for the thing. Digger suddenly stopped talking and gave me this look. Then she kicked me off her ship and was out of the docking bay before I’d even cleared the hangar!” 

“I know that Digger spends a lot of her time investigating Thargoid stuff planet-side. So I’m going to visit a few and see what turns up. There’s got to be more of those things out there, and if they end up being worth something, then I want my share.”
