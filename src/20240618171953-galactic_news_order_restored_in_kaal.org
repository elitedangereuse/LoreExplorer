* Galactic News: Order Restored in Kaal

/25 Aug 3303/

The Kuk Silver Fortune Company has announced that its campaign to clear the Kaal system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in the Kaal system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vercors Station in the Kaal system.
