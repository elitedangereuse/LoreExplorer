[[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] Questions Convenience of Emperor’s Recovery 
 
In a secretly recorded and unguarded discussion with one of her aides, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] is allegedly seen to question the motives of Senator [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] and other parties close to the Emperor. 

“How is this possible? Am I not the most beloved person in the Empire? This is clear manoeuvring to make sure that Arissa becomes the heir. I can see her annoyingly haughty expression now. That Blaine thinks she will let him carry on doing what he wants .” 

The recording has received universal condemnation from sources on both sides. Senator Blaine refused to comment directly, although an aide claimed that an investigation would be initiated. 

[[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] issued a statement denying the validity of the recording: 

“This so-called recording is barely audible, and clearly a fabrication. I have not and would not say the despicable things portrayed in this horrid fantasy. My best technicians are already working to discover how this fraud has been perpetrated, and rest assured that the criminals will be caught.”
