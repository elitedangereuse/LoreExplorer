* Galactic News: Halsey Comments on End of Cold War

/28 Oct 3303/

With the news that [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] has withdrawn its fleets from the Pleiades Nebula, apparently signalling the end of the Federal-Imperial cold war, former Federal president [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] has commented on the cessation of hostilities. 

Addressing a large crowd in Nerah City on Argent’s Claim, Halsey said: 

“Like many of you, I rejoiced when I heard the Federation had recalled its ships. But my jubilation was undercut by the knowledge that our protests and entreaties had failed to move a single Federal or Imperial vessel. Were it not for the emergence of a greater potential threat, [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] and Federation might still be installed in the Pleiades, squabbling over barnacles. And while the impact of the conflict could have been far greater, it was still far from a bloodless war.” 

“I would like to believe that the Federation and Empire have learned from this experience, but I suspect they have not. But I promise you that I will continue to help those affected by such conflicts, for as long as I am able.”
