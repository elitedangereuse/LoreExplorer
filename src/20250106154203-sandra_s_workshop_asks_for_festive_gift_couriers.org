* Sandra’s Workshop Asks for Festive Gift Couriers

/20 Dec 3310/

The CEO of leading children’s toy manufacturer [[id:40f307c4-5447-493c-bc3a-2b8ad20a595e][Sandra’s Workshop]] has
requested help with parcel deliveries.

[[id:8e7e3014-eedf-4896-bc92-20512403b8a8][Sandra Corrs]], the much-loved [[id:87e48435-d66d-476a-9468-12b4750388ee][philanthropist]] who provides gifts to
children across the core systems each year, made a similar request two
years ago. Then, with the Thargoid invasion just beginning, her
courier fleet was loaned out to help refugee evacuation efforts.

This year a different problem has emerged just as the Thargoid
Invasion appears to be over, as Sandra explained to [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“Our Dolph’s Routes transport fleet has been upgraded and fitted to
increase delivery capacity. Or, as we like to say in the workshop:
‘ferry even more joy’, haha! But we’ve discovered a rather irksome
snag: with so many little boys and girls displaced by the nasty alien
invasion, it’s going to be a challenge finding them all!”

“Even our fleet won’t be able to deliver all our presents on time,
given the extra work needed to track down their proper delivery
points. We’ll need to rely on kind-hearted pilots to volunteer their
time and ensure we can brighten the smiles on every child on our
list.”

Pilots willing to help Sandra’s Workshop can collect festive gifts
from the [[id:aea6f093-b65a-4a23-b818-4cabf62b555d][Frost Dock]] outpost in the Njambalba system. The outpost can
only provide landing pads for small- and medium-sized vessels. A
beacon outside [[id:aea6f093-b65a-4a23-b818-4cabf62b555d][Frost Dock]] holds delivery information which can be
acquired via scan.
