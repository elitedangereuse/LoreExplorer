* Freelance Report: Barnacles Continue to Occupy the Canonn

/23 Feb 3302/

Verity Gavroche, public correspondent for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, has been speaking to [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] about his teams' ongoing research: 

"I realise the public might think our research has stopped because the barnacles and the Unknown Artefacts have not been in the news, but I can assure you that we are still hard at work. Many Commanders have undertaken expeditions to distant nebulae in the hope of uncovering more barnacles. We've also been working hard to map all the barnacle sites in the Pleiades. In fact, a new site was recently discovered on [[id:5fcd46ca-b9bc-4135-8596-79ac2f8883f5][Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-16]] C4." 

"We are also trying to understand why the barnacles appear in the Pleiades. Are the raw materials in the nebulae important for their growth? Perhaps the ancient cloud the Pleiades is moving through has long held the 'seeds' for Barnacle growth, and they've only now taken root? We don't know, but we will continue our research." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
