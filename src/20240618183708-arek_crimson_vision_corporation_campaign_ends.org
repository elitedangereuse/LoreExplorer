* Arek Crimson Vision Corporation Campaign Ends

/09 Mar 3304/

A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has announced that its appeal for weapons has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to the organisationâ€™s base of operations. The weapons will now be shipped to the Colonia region. 

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation issued a statement thanking those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Gold Hub in the Arek system.
