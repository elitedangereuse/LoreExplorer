* Starport Upgrade Initiative to Support Fleet Carriers

/11 Sep 3306/

A press release from Brewer Corporation discusses plans to improve access to refuelling for owners of fleet carriers. 

“We have been surprised and gratified by the popularity of our latest product. The options for independent pilots and crews have been considerably expanded by the versatility and capability of our Drake-Class Carriers.” 

“But we have also listened to customers’ concerns, in particular that large ships such as Anacondas, Corvettes and Clippers cannot dock with refinery outposts to take on Tritium fuel.” 

“To help alleviate this issue, Brewer Corporation has partnered with two independent construction firms: Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc. They are tasked with upgrading a number of outposts into fully functioning starports, in order to make refuelling runs more efficient.” 

The two construction companies that won this contract both have impressive track records in modifying orbital habitats. Kavanagh Spaceframes specialises in Orbis starports, while Steel Castle exclusively works with Coriolis designs. The projects are expected to begin next week.
