* Oktoberfest Supply Campaign Successful

/04 Oct 3304/

Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has confirmed that its appeal for commodities to supply an Oktoberfest celebration in the Bhagui system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community.  

Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Leavitt Port, and by protecting traders in the Bhagui system. 

A spokesperson for Mould Federal Mining Incorporated issued the following statement:  

“Thanks to so many generous pilots, Bhagui Oktoberfest will now go ahead. Revellers will be able to put aside their differences, forget their troubles and celebrate life.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Leavitt Port in the Bhagui system.
