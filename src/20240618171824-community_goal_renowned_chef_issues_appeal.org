* Community Goal: Renowned Chef Issues Appeal

/23 Jun 3303/

Celebrated chef and culinary scholar Dr Cordelius Swainn has issued an appeal to the galactic community for rare goods for one of his famous celebrity soirées 

In a statement, Swainn said: 

“I create unique dining experiences for the wealthiest patrons and most important dignitaries to visit the Lave system. I will be hosting another of these events in a few weeks for one of my most important clients, and am therefore seeking rare commodities from across the galaxy. But it is not only food I require – I am in need of a wealth of exotic goods, all of which will contribute to overall ambience.” 

The appeal is being financed by Dr Swainn’s corporate partner, Lave Incorporated, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested commodities to Lave Station. 

The campaign begins on the 22nd June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
