* Major Victories against the League of Reparation

/06 Jul 3304/

A series of successful operations against the League of Reparation has led to much of the terrorist group being dismantled. 

Captain Niamh Seutonia, a member of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League, released this statement: 

“Over the last few days, Senior Agent Ramirez and I have led multiple raids against the League of Reparation. We interdicted several of their ships and located many outposts concealed within Imperial and Federal systems. The key to these victories was the decryption of their communications network.” 

“Despite meeting fierce resistance, our security forces arrested or eliminated dozens of League members. In some cases, we acted just in time to prevent further murderous acts against those descended from members of the INRA.” 

“We believe the League has been dealt a fatal blow, but we are still investigating how they gained access to top-level comms encryption and other restricted equipment, which suggests support from influential individuals. Furthermore, we have yet to identify Nexus, the organisation’s coordinator. We have many fresh leads, however, and expect further results soon.” 

Milo Vesper, an editor for The Alliance Tribune, published this opinion piece: 

“This may be great news for some, but what about our citizens? The taskforce should be hunting down these animals in the Alliance! We know they’re here, what with Admiral Buchanan at Lave and the trap they set for Chief Inspector Kilbride, whose bravery we will never forget. Why isn’t her replacement out there on raids too?” 

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.
