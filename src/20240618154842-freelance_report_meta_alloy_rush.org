* Freelance Report: Meta-Alloy Rush

/18 Jul 3302/

As [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and Empire attempt to lay claim to the organic structures known as barnacles, the demand for meta-alloys has skyrocketed. Many starports have begun placing orders for the material as a hedge against potential malfunctions. 

Vernon Trask, lead engineer at Bauschinger City, said: "Some stations have been defunct for nearly a year because of those corrosive Artefacts. We can't afford to be out of commission that long." 

"Quite a few stations in [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] have open orders for meta-alloys, including Bauschinger. We're hoping to get ahead of this techno-plague before it bites us." 

This 'meta-alloy rush' has alarmed conservationists and researchers concerned about the future of the barnacles. 

"We know so little about the barnacles," said Dr Elana Lorax, a noted xenobiologist. "We don't know how they grow, how long they live or how they create meta-alloys. If the exploitation continues at this rate, we may never know."
