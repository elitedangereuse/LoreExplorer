* Freelance Report: August Exodus Ends with a Bang

/02 Sep 3302/

On the 30th of August 3302, the August Exodus came to end with dozens of independent pilots assembling outside [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station for photos and general tomfoolery. 

Despite a few explosions, revellers enjoyed a race on the track that will host the first official event of the newly established Colonia Citizens Network on the 4th of September. 

The August Exodus team issued a statement saying: "With the establishment of this colony, our wildest dreams have come true. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all those who took part in this endeavour. This could not have happened without your help."
