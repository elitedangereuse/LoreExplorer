* The Thargoids
** Human-Thargoid Contact
The Thargoids are a nonhuman race with a history of hostility towards
humanity.

The first recorded encounter with a Thargoid ship took place in 2849,
although earlier undocumented encounters are believed to have taken
place. In the years that followed, contact with lone Thargoid vessels
was intermittently reported.

Humanity clashed with the Thargoids in the 32nd century, but details of
the conflict remained scarce for many years, and it proved difficult to
differentiate authentic accounts of Thargoid encounters from the
sensationalist media stories of the time.

The discovery of abandoned Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm bases in 3303
did much to dispel the fog, however. The INRA, a joint Federal-Imperial
intiative established in 3193, was responsible for researching the
Thargoids and developing technologies to counter their aggression, but
the organisation's lack of accountability meant that the details of its
research did not come to light until years after is dissolution.

Almost all of the reliable data concerning the Thargoids have been
sourced from INRA facilities. This data, originally deemed highly
confidential, was declassified in 3304 following a resolution from the
Federal Government and an Imperial decree. Some controversy over the
backing and funding of the INRA remains, however.

** Society
The INRA discovered that Thargoid society is organised into hives, with
most Thargoids falling into three categories -- queens, princesses and
drones. Queens function as reproducers, while drones serve to maintain a
favourable environment for the rest of the hive. Thargoid hives can be
vast, although it may be that some of the larger observed groups are in
fact multiple, overlapping hives. Ultimately, little is known for sure.

The average Thargoid queen is at least as intelligent as a human being,
while the typical drone possesses a more rudimentary level of
intelligence. Existing evidence suggests that queens have extremely long
lifespans, living for hundreds or even thousands of years. The variable
size of queens' neurocraniums suggests this might be an indicator of
age.

Little is known about the precise nature of Thargoid reproduction, but
it is likely that queens can reproduce both sexually (with other queens)
and asexually. It is thought that the latter method produces drones,
while the former produces a new queen. Analysis of Thargoid specimens
led some INRA researchers to believe that a new queen, or 'princess',
becomes a full queen only once it has produced drones of its own.
Significantly, queens are believed to be single sex.

The Thargoids' ability to reproduce asexually means that their
populations can expand incredibly quickly, but it is thought that they
deliberately restrict the size of the populace so as not to deplete all
available resources. There is evidence to suggest that this is sometimes
achieved by culling older drones.

INRA testing indicated that queens perceive drones as entirely
expendable, presumably due to the ease with which they can be replaced.
Indeed, a Thargoid queen appears to give no more thought to the loss of
a drone than a human would an eyelash.

** Communication
The belief that Thargoids were capable of some form of extra-sensory
communication was often cited in the early years of human-Thargoid
interaction, but prior to the discovery of INRA records it was not fully
understood.

Professor Uri Anslow of the INRA theorised that a Thargoid queen can
communicate with the drones in its hive via a spread-spectrum electronic
signal, and can use this signal to control the drones, and even to share
their sensory input. Studies of battlefield footage certainly suggest
some kind of near-instantaneous communication among Thargoids, and the
presence of low-level radio noise in areas occupied by Thargoids
indicates that they do indeed communicate via short-range electronic
signals. Professor Anslow went on to claim that a queen could
effectively see and hear through its drones, but her contemporaries were
sceptical, dismissing the assertion as baseless. Professor Ishmael
Palin, one of the galaxy's foremost experts on the Thargoids, has even
gone so far as to denounce Anslow as a 'glory hound'.

Thargoids have been known to make staccato clicking noises with their
mouthparts when in the presence of humans, punctuated with occasional
hisses and buzzes. They have also been observed directing such noises at
one another, albeit much less frequently. Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], a
founding member of the joint-superpower initiative Aegis and a
specialist in interspecies communication, has studied INRA audio logs
and suggested that the sounds probably represent some kind of language,
due to the repetition of certain sound combinations.

It is unclear why the Thargoids would sometimes choose to communicate
with each other vocally, given their capactiy for extrasensory
communication. Professor Anslow suggested that the sounds could be
designed to intimidate enemies or opponents, noting that Thargoids often
produced them prior to combat.

Thargoid ships have been observed emitting a complex array of sounds,
and in some cases subtly changing colour. The exact meaning of these
behaviours has not been determined, but they appear to correspond to
different emotional states. What is not known is if these sounds are
produced by the pilot and amplified by the ship, or emitted by the ship
itself. If the sounds originate with the pilot, it would suggest some
kind of physiological connection between pilot and vessel. Given the
sophistication of Thargoid bio-engineering, however, it is possible that
the sounds come from the ship itself, and that Thargoid ships are able
to feel and communicate to a limited degree.

The hulls of Thargoid ships are typically emblazoned with one of several
symbols, the meaning of which is unknown. Some have theorised that they
could denote membership of a particular familial group, or possibly be
an indicator of rank.

** Physiology
Human understanding of Thargoid physiology is far from complete, but
recovered INRA data has offered some insights into their nature.

INRA records describe the average Thargoid as physically larger than a
human being, and generally insectoid in appearance. Thargoid biology is
carbon-based, using an RNA-like encoding for biological information, but
Thargoid chemistry is based on ammonia rather than water. Consequently,
while Thargoids can comfortably tolerate environments as cold as minus
80 degrees Celcius, they cannot withstand environments warmer than 45
degrees Celcius for long.

According to notes compiled by Doctor Peregrine Henig, an INRA
researcher, Thargoids can survive for a significant time in the vacuum
of space without apparent discomfort, and can tolerate radiation and
extreme cold for far longer than a human.

** Vulnerabilities
In 3151, the INRA developed a biological weapon known as they mycoid
virus for use against the Thargoids. The virus was the result of an
accidental discovery made by an INRA researcher, who noted that a
particular strain of fungus was found to thrive on the hulls of Thargoid
vessels, and appeared to be digesting the material of which the ship was
made.

The INRA refined the fungal strain and began experimenting on living
Thargoids and their spacecraft. The mycoid proved to have delterious
effects on both, leading to the swift elimination of the Thargoids
active in human-occupied space at the time.

It is widely assumed that since the last human-Thargoid conflict, the
Thargoids have developed an immunity to the mycoid virus.

** Starships
In terms of structure and function, Thargoid vessels are radically
different from anything produced by humanity, and are able to navigate
hyperspace in ways that are not fully understood. They are also at least
partly organic, meaning that they can self-repair -- or heal -- over
time.

Ship function in general, and this restorative ability in particular,
have been shown to be dependent upon the so-called Thargoid heart -- a
biomechanical organ found in varying quantities in different Thargoid
ships. These hearts often survive the destruction of the ship, enabling
them to be salvaged, although they can also be targed and damaged with
appropriate weaponry. They are highly corrosive, however, and require
special containers for safe transport.

Thargoid vessels that have sustained combat damage exhibit scar-like
patterns. Given that Thargoid technology is sophisticated enough for
such damage to be repaired, it follows that the Thargoids might
deliberately choose to preserve these scars.

INRA logs document an encounter with a Thargoid mothership many times
larger than other Thargoid craft, against which the mycoid virus was
successfully deployed, although no such vessels have been reported in
recent times.

** Structures
Dozens of planets in human-occupied space are peppered with Thargoid
barnacles -- biological resource extractors that convert minerals into
meta-alloys, a key component in the creation of Thargoid vehicles and
technology. Theories that these barnacles have been genetically
engineered by the Thargoids have yet to be verified.

Larger structures, referred to as Thargoid surface sites, have also been
discovered. These sites typically consist of a spiral-shaped structure
nesting within a shallow crater, beneath which lies a series of tunnels.
At the heart of this sub-surface network is a device that, once
activated, emits a holographic star map. The sites are patrolled by
semi-sentient biomechanical entities called scavengers.

** War with the Guardians
Archaeological records have revealed that the extinct nonhuman
civilization known as the Guardians experienced conflict with the
Thargoids several million years ago.

Logs recovered from Guardian sites indicate that the Thargoids were the
aggressor in this conflict. Having seeded Guardian space with
biomechanical constructs used for resource extraction long before the
emergence of the Guardians' civilisation, the Thargoids apparently
believed they were entitled to uncontested dominion of the territory.
The Guardians attempted to communicate with the Thargoids and reach a
compromise, but without success.

Over the course of the conflict, the Guardians developed new
technologies to give them an advantage against the Thargoids. These
technologies were apparently successful, forcing Thargoids to abandon
their offensive.

** Agenda
Thargoids do not attack indiscriminately, and their choice of targets
shows them to be highly intelligent. They have conducted targeted
strikes on Aegis facilities and attacked pilots carrying Thargoid items
in their cargo holds, indicating that they know they are being studied
and want to halt the process. But despite their evident intelligence,
they appear to be completely uninterested in meaningful communication.

The engineer Ram Tah, who has extensively researched the Guardians and
their war with the Thargoids, holds the view that Thargoid aggression is
a product of territorialism. They seed an area with barnacles, thus
laying claim to it, and return -- sometimes many centuries later -- to
harvest the extracted resources. Any lifeform advanced enough to compete
with them for the territory is treated as an enemy and summarily
attacked.

Professor Palin concurs with this view, adding that the Thargoids are
apparently so determined to eliminate any threats to their long-term
survival, they will not tolerate any advanced species in close
proximity.
