* Freelance Report: The Mercury Seven Expedition

/03 Mar 3303/

This weekend, the Mercury Seven expedition will depart from Jaques Station in the Colonia system. Citizens are invited to join the expedition, or to watch it depart at 7.00 UTC on the 5th of March 3303. 

The expedition takes its name from the Mercury Seven, a group of astronauts from an early spaceflight programme â€“ brave men who risked much to explore the frontier. 

The expedition will comprise a number of stages, with regular stops for those with SRVs or fighters. Sights will include the Orio-Persean Conflux, the Osprey Stellar Remnant, Wagar's Reach and Zephyrus. 

Pilots who want to participate are encouraged to contact the Colonia Citizens Network.
