* Inhabited Generation Ship Discovered

/08 Nov 3305/

A [[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][generation ship]] with a living population has been discovered in the
[[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system.

The ship’s distress signal was initially picked up by a [[id:4df4a36a-20bf-43ca-9bf1-2324f832ab81][listening
post]]. Investigating pilots were surprised to find that the ancient
vessel - identified as the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] - had drifted into the uninhabited
region around [[id:240cb7c7-e94f-46b8-bbda-021a0d0ea538][Upaniklis B]].

[[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][Generation ships]] are huge, self-sufficient craft from the
pre-hyperdrive era, designed to deliver their original crews’
descendants to uninhabited systems. Launched in the 22nd century, the
Golconda has survived for more than a millennium as the home of a
self-reliant society.

But it is believed the vessel’s outdated facilities are struggling to
meet the needs of its crew. The inhabitants have reported a lack of
maintenance materials and medical supplies, the latter made more
pertinent by a [[id:dd5abb31-73fb-4390-82ad-33030cb49d38][virus]] sweeping through the ship.

[[id:868d286f-de8c-40f7-9743-bbadc4d38423][Itsuko Harada]] of [[id:f3e9c36a-0e5d-493b-8fff-b86cdb2a3dcb][Upaniklis Vision Incorporated]] gave the following
statement:

“These visitors have crossed incredible distances, entirely
disconnected from the rest of humanity until now. Sheer desperation
has forced these proud people to call for help – a disease referred to
as ‘[[id:62c30f25-2c97-444a-8572-7169cfbf1ab5][the wasting kiss]]’ is running rampant, and in a closed environment
its effects may prove catastrophic.”

“Understandably, the Golconda’s people are reluctant to leave their
home or interact with the rest of the galaxy, at least at
present. They have gratefully accepted our offer of medical supplies
and other materials, however.”

Traders are asked to deliver basic medicines, advanced medicines,
aluminium, ceramic composites and semiconductors to [[id:01afd0e9-6618-4c17-b425-4e228f418159][Fozard Port]] in the
[[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system. Upaniklis Vision Incorporated is also offering
bounty vouchers on wanted ships to deter [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]] activity in the area.

The initiative is scheduled to run from the 8th to the 14th of
November 3305. If the final targets are met earlier than planned, the
campaign will end immediately.
