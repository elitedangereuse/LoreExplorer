* Free Marlinist Candidate Wins Election

/22 Jul 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Kayode Tau has been elected as prime consul for the Marlinists, following a successful data delivery initiative. 

The candidate from the Free Marlinist Movement faction received more public votes than rival nominee Verity Dexter. His campaign was supported by deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files in greater quantities. 

Prime Consul Tau will now serve as the lead ambassador for the Marlinist Colonies in all dealings with the superpowers. He gave this statement to the media: 

“The Marlinist Consulate will act to preserve our colonies’ independence, and improve diplomatic relations with the rest of the galaxy. Let me be clear – we do not represent the extremist views of Neo-Marlinism. Our consuls will assist all efforts to eliminate the NMLA.” 

In the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Aaron Whyte protested that ignoring the Neo-Marlinist fringe was “a provocative act that could inflame further violence”. First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for the result of the democratic vote to be respected. 

Pilots who supported Kayode Tau can now collect their rewards from Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 system.
