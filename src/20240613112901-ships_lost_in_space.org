* 0187 Ships Lost in Space
[[id:113500ff-cc01-4fe3-a0f4-87d92e2c2d31][Zelada]]

In 2867, disappearances of several traders near Zelada prompted a
[[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal Navy]] response under the new President [[id:8cd6d869-45c4-448f-b6ec-11814b056178][Olaf Smith]]. The task
force soon found itself with more to do when further ships disappeared
in Ququve and Aymiay in the same year, totalling thirteen ships in
three months. In response, the Federation bolstered forces on [[id:735abc3e-2370-4fd4-a38c-3796f0dfd536][Laedla]]
rapidly and militarised the system as a base in response to this alien
threat.

It has never been determined that these disappearances could be
attributed to the Thargoids and little documentation has emerged about
the Federal battlegroup's activities in this sector in this
period. Nevertheless, Smith made much of his show of strength 'driving
away the alien threat' and was popular as a result, further enhancing
naval forces and drawing a line under the [[id:77091a28-dc28-405d-bb97-c32a1aecdd33][Gellan]] incident and the
taint it had delivered to the Presidential office.
