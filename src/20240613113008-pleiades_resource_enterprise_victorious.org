[[id:af205c6d-cb6f-4d7b-bcdd-42dc2999c376][Maia]]  

On November 1st 3302 reports from Maia indicated that the [[id:268dd81e-54f9-447a-9a47-11b2f7242e81][Pleiades
Resource Enterprise]] successfully overcame resistance from the [[id:c8cf3da4-154e-49a2-98ff-039aaab3b1dd][Ant Hill
Mob]] to gain a foothold in the system.

A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise released a brief
statement:

"The Ant Hill Mob believes our expansion into Maia was orchestrated by
Federal officials, but I think they're just looking for a way of
explaining their defeat. In war, it's the stronger side that
wins. Simple as that. We may be aligned with the [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]], but we
were acting on our own behalf."
