* Superpowers Plan to Replace Aegis

/18 Jan 3308/

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have accepted the [[id:f87fc526-4e0d-4019-aa88-15d40da45ac9][Baumann Report]]’s
recommendation to permanently shut down [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]].

The independent inquiry’s findings on the organisation’s failings will
result in Aegis being immediately shut down. However, Chief
Administrator [[id:fa943255-7f7c-4ac5-b8ac-86c78b156512][Carter Armstrong]] has cautioned that “full demobilisation
of staff, ships and resources might take several months”.

Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] has successfully obtained senatorial approval
for an increased military budget, to allow the [[id:e9becd28-9644-42aa-afc8-7bba3ce10076][Imperial Navy]] to
directly take on the role played by Aegis.

Fleet Admiral [[id:b185e009-c014-443d-b73b-63b625ebfec6][Tayo Maikori]] likewise confirmed that the [[id:614fd344-ec09-483c-a28e-0289590946c4][Federal
Congress]] has ordered the creation of a new naval strike force. On his
own authority he has also commissioned an investigation into
[[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]], following [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]’s testimony regarding the nature of the
[[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][anti-xeno]] [[id:6023377d-7271-49d1-80ec-ffab82dc8c29][superweapon]].

Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], who was recently appointed to the [[id:b0b347ac-10b8-4190-8787-1557f7d4a6da][Council of
Admirals]], stated that the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] and [[id:3dd2f3c7-3ddf-4900-aa28-580344edd509][Sirius Navy]] will
work in conjunction to fulfil Aegis’s purpose.

[[id:4e827915-3759-4040-97d0-346eac70fb5e][Xenological research]] laboratories set up by Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]]
will now transfer their work to specialist departments in the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway
Bioscience Institute]], [[id:1719bc8f-26fd-43f4-958d-fbbf98ef8648][Imperial Science Academy]] and [[id:f0ff8ab8-beec-480c-9b04-41279c11a1ee][Olympus Village
University]]. In 3304 the Thargoids made targeted strikes against
Aegis’s labs, but all three institutions have made assurances that the
new locations will have the highest security.
