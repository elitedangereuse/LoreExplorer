* Week in Review

/03 Nov 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

The investigation into the death of Alliance presidential candidate [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]] has concluded with no convictions. Alliance Interpol confirmed that Silva’s death was a homicide, but said that all avenues of investigation had been exhausted. [[id:e9a91ed4-acc1-4e93-9dee-b0aa03fd2ce9][Tashmira Silva]] has now assumed control of her late sister’s corporate empire. 

A radical group called Nova Imperium is gaining influence throughout the Empire. The organisation claims that to survive the Thargoid conflict, the Empire must sever contact with all other systems and concentrate on protecting itself. Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the group’s rhetoric. 

Meanwhile, the engineer [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] has rejected an offer from the Sirius Corporation to support the manufacture of Guardian-human technology. In a statement, [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] said the technologies were too important to become corporate products, and reaffirmed that using tech brokers to distribute the designs allowed them to be widely available. 

In other news, the [[id:0ba9accc-93ad-45a0-a771-e26daa59e58f][Federal Security Service]] has abruptly terminated its investigation of The Mars Tribune regarding personal administration robots fitted with hidden surveillance programs. It has been alleged that a senior figure in the FSS ordered the task force to focus elsewhere. 

Recent reports from the Geras system indicate that after a spate of reciprocal attacks, hostilities between the Geras First and the Ndozins State Inc have escalated into all-out war. The warring organisations have issued calls to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction. 

Finally, Senator [[id:1d3d8a69-609b-4e83-b1a1-a46cb23ba195][Caspian Leopold]] has announced that his appeal for aid has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. A spokesperson for the senator said that a humanitarian crisis had been narrowly averted, while assuring refugees at Leopold’s rehabilitation centre that new homes would be found for each and every one of them. 

And those are the main stories this week.
