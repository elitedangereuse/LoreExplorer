* 0116 Alliance Council Members
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

Each Alliance Member State has a number of Council Members within the
Alliance Assembly, based on the size of their respective
populations. Some only have one. The Prime Minister is elected by the
Members, and it is his or her job to corral them into some sort of
consensus; generally a slow process. There is much less tradition than
in the other powers, and processes within the Alliance Assembly are
still subject to change - generally when arguments break out, as they
frequently do. In practice the Alliance is largely run by Civil
Servants - salaried officials that look after day to day running of
the Alliance, generally not getting involved in the political
struggles.

The Alliance Defence Force is run by the six member Council of
Admirals, independently from the Council of Members, but reporting to
it after the event, to facilitate rapid decision-making. Each of the
Admirals is from a key contributing Navy.
