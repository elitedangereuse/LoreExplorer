* 0186 Gellan Scandal
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]

In 2866 [[id:77091a28-dc28-405d-bb97-c32a1aecdd33][Gellan]] lost his mid-term Vote of Confidence, and the extent of his
corruption and corporate links were brought to light shortly
afterwards, bringing down a number of Congressmen too, and exposing a
seedy sub-culture of corporate entertainment and abuse of Federal
power on a massive scale. No on on the corporate side was ever
prosecuted, but a period of scrutiny followed and most corporations
wisely back off interference with Federal politics for several years.
