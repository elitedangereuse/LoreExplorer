* Shinrarta Dezhra Defence Fleet Prevails

/24 Sep 3310/

The Thargoid invasion fleet that ambushed the Shinrarta Dezhra system last week has been successfully repelled. 

Providing an update on behalf of the system was Florian Baljak, acting starport commander of Jameson Memorial: 

“The Thargoids swept through Shinrarta Dezhra hard and fast, taking our defences offline before we were able to regroup. It’s a miracle Jameson Memorial lasted until reinforcements could arrive.” 

“We lost a lot of good people driving the aliens back. But thanks to the efforts of thousands of Commanders, along with auxiliary support from Sirius Corporation and Azimuth Corporation, we can say victory in this particular battle.” 

Work has commenced on bringing all system ports back online as quickly as possible. Requests for assistance in delivering commodities to the system have been submitted. 

Head of Aegis, [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], offered her gratitude to those involved in the fighting while Aegis directed AX efforts on the frontline with the two remaining Thargoid Titans. 

The initiative will remain open for any remaining bounty voucher hand-ins. Participants will be able to collect their credit rewards from Rescue Ship Cornwallis in the V886 Centauri system once the initiative ends. Module rewards will be distributed automatically in due course.
