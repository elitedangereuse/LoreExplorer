* Galactic News: Prospects for Malfunctioning Starports Improving

/30 Aug 3302/

Technical personnel at New Dawn Station in the Ceos system have announced a breakthrough in the ongoing fight against the so-called technological plague. 

Tag Arthurs, head of the starport's technical team, released the following statement to news feeds: 

"Although our understanding of meta-alloys remains incomplete, we are now able to apply them much more efficiently. Consequently, we now need much smaller quantities of meta-alloys to return a malfunctioning starport to functionality â€“ half as much as we used to, in fact." 

"We've also determined that the week immediately following the first signs of Unknown Artefact-related interference is a critical one. If an affected starport can be supplied with meta-alloys within that week, it is far less likely that the situation at the starport will worsen."
