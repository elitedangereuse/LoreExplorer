* Alliance Festival of Culture Begins

/27 Jul 3305/

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has announced the start of the Alliance Festival of Culture, a series of events taking place across seven systems. 

The Alliance Tribune’s cultural correspondent Corinne Macintyre provided a summary of the festival: 

“This seven-week tour of Alliance space will begin at the Fine Art Emporium on [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]]. We have been promised that a wide range of artistic achievements, entertainment and history will be highlighted.” 

“Naturally, the Tribune will be offering in-depth coverage over the course of the festival.” 

The prime minister was visibly pleased to introduce the Alliance Festival of Culture, describing it as “a celebration to lift citizens’ spirits in these challenging times”. It has been speculated that Mahon is hoping to move forward from the recent political scandals involving [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]]. 

The centrepiece of the opening ceremony was a tribute to Megan Madigan, widely considered one of the most significant visual artists of the late 33rd Century. Her most famous work, titled ‘Penance Street’, was tragically lost in transit sixty years ago. The much-loved painting was honoured by modern reinterpretations from dozens of [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]]’s finest artists.
