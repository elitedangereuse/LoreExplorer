[[id:3b5b7101-a735-4d40-a48e-215cdcf06a27][Gaylen Trasken Duval]]'s first act as Emperor, was to expand the
[[id:7210d36a-25f5-4c8e-8cf2-069de549d438][Imperial palace]] on Capitol, transforming the building into the glowing
pink glass structure we know today. To complete his vision, the
Emperor hired thousands of the galaxy's best designers and architects
to work on the structure. The result is one of the great manufactured
interstellar marvels of our age.
