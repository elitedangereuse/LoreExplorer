* 0142 Ashfield's Death
[[id:dfbc8f06-6724-4a34-a908-f90a2fe3ba43][Zeaex]]

In 2976, the death of [[id:427b921a-bfb3-4f81-83f5-9c2df18b82d9][Francis Ashfield]] in the Zeaex system, allegedly
at the hands of [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federal]] [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassins]], prompted only the second major
military assembly of [[id:164e5782-9d44-45d3-9bc7-f769de096303][Olban Hensard Duval]]'s reign. However, conflict
was averted when the settlers of Newtown in the system sent a personal
appeal to both the Federation and the Empire, which resolved the
matter of mining rights and established an uneasy truce.
