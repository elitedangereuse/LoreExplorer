* 0500 [[id:4cd2cbf1-0257-4c0f-b5eb-46e96661b509][Octavia Quinton]]'s Derelict Asteroid Base
[[id:377aeee7-ee8d-46b8-a9c6-c81b1b76c8af][Suijin]]

A ruined base left over from events in 3300. The base was rumoured to
be a [[id:97ea89e5-e1f9-4ee5-abef-9690edc0830c][stronghold]] of notorious [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]] lord [[id:4cd2cbf1-0257-4c0f-b5eb-46e96661b509][Octavia Quinton]], who was
killed in mid 3300 when she became involved in the Reclamation of the
[[id:8da12af2-6006-4e7e-a45e-7bf8b2c299c8][Prism]] system. Today it is a ruin and visitors are warned not to
venture within. Rumours abound that it is heavily [[id:b2cc9430-9295-4ce7-80c6-ac3887f13eac][booby-trapped]].
