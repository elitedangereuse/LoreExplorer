By 2200 corporations had a stranglehold on a great many aspects of life, and this didn't stop during colonisation, though there was quite a delay before the first wholly corporate system was settled. The colonisation of Sirius by a solely corporate mission in 2339 and its rapid to rise to become the premier supplier of drive fuel to first the Federation and then [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] led to much corporate profiteering between the two powers. Throughout this period, conflicts of interest were raised by congressmen backedby corporate interests. However, eventually Sirius Corporation delegates were also responsible for initiating negotiations between the two powers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |   |   |   |
