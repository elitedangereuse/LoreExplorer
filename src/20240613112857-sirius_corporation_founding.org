By 2200 corporations had a stranglehold on a great many aspects of
life, and this didn't stop during colonisation, though there was quite
a delay before the first wholly corporate system was settled. The
colonisation of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] by a solely corporate mission in 2339 and its
rapid to rise to become the premier supplier of drive fuel to first
the Federation and then the Empire led to much corporate profiteering
between the two powers. Throughout this period, conflicts of interest
were raised by congressmen backedby corporate interests. However,

initiating negotiations between the two powers.
