* Mass Thargoid Strike – Emergency Declared

/13 May 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Thargoid forces have invaded the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] system and several systems in the California, Coalsack and Pleiades Nebulas. 

Huge numbers of Thargoid scouts and interceptors have appeared within multiple systems. Aegis has mobilised available defences, but also requested assistance from anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots in combating the Thargoids. 

Shipments of Guardian artefacts were recently delivered to the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] system as part of an Aegis research programme. Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] has speculated that the Thargoids’ well-documented aversion to Guardian technology may be the reason why Delphi was targeted. 

Two starports recently constructed by the Kumo Crew syndicate – California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system and Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system – are among those seriously damaged by the assault. [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]], the syndicate’s warlord, announced: 

“I’m not going to let these filthy aliens tear down what we’ve only just built. We need to teach them a lesson that even they will understand!”  

All attacked stations have called upon the galactic community for help with rescuing their populations.
