* Mass [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Strike – Emergency Declared

/13 May 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Thargoid forces have invaded the Delphi system and several systems in the California, Coalsack and Pleiades Nebulas. 

Huge numbers of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] scouts and interceptors have appeared within multiple systems. Aegis has mobilised available defences, but also requested assistance from anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots in combating the Thargoids. 

Shipments of Guardian artefacts were recently delivered to the Delphi system as part of an Aegis research programme. Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] has speculated that the Thargoids’ well-documented aversion to Guardian technology may be the reason why Delphi was targeted. 

Two starports recently constructed by the Kumo Crew syndicate – California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system and Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system – are among those seriously damaged by the assault. Archon Delaine, the syndicate’s warlord, announced: 

“I’m not going to let these filthy aliens tear down what we’ve only just built. We need to teach them a lesson that even they will understand!”  

All attacked stations have called upon the galactic community for help with rescuing their populations.
