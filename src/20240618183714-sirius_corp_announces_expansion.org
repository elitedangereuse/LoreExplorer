* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp Announces Expansion

/23 Mar 3304/

The [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation has announced that it will be expanding its presence at two locations just outside the core systems. 

  

A spokesperson for [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] made this statement: 

“For some time now, the amount of traffic passing through both the Ceos and [[id:aa43803c-e60c-45bf-ab48-49a139931c68][Sothis]] systems has been steadily increasing. Naturally, we are keen to ensure that all pilots have access to essential services.” 

“To this end, we are in the process of building several new starports and settlements in these systems, as well as several megaships. These will support Ceos and [[id:aa43803c-e60c-45bf-ab48-49a139931c68][Sothis]]’s residents and visitors, and provide pilots with the high standard of services that they have come to expect from [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp.”
