* Silver United Succeed at Securing [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]]

/05 May 3301/

After months of being terrorised by malicious criminals intent on turning the Old Worlds into some kind of ‘New Caribbean’, residents of the [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] cluster finally banded together this past weekend to crack down on the lawless scum that had been pillaging and plundering their way across the sector. 

Inspired by the recent help freely given to the people of [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] by the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, Silver United [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]utions decided to offer a set of substantial rewards to any pilot brave enough to help remove the criminals known as the Jet Gang from [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]].   

The initiative was an overwhelming success. 5,535 pilots were temporarily deputised during the course of the weekend, leading to the [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]] Jet Gang (and many other local pirate crews) being crushed by the raw power of the makeshift fleet. 

To celebrate their success, Silver United [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]utions has organised a special discount on all Faulcon DeLacy ships being sold from Ridley Scott Station, [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]]. A limited number of Pythons have been made available for the duration of the sale.
