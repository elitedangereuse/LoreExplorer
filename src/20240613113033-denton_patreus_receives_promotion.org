[[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]]

On February 22nd 3302 Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] announced that
Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]]' promotion to Admiral of the Fleet following
his triumph over the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn. In a
statement, the Emperor praised Patreus' recent military success:

[[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] exhibited remarkable resolve in the campaign against
Emperor's Dawn, and demonstrated his ability to act with conviction in
the face of an often unpredictable enemy. I can think of no more
appropriate person to assume command of the Imperial Navy. It is with
great pride that I confer upon him the title of Admiral of the
Fleet."
