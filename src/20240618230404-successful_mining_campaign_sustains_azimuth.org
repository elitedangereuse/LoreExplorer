/08 Sep 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A range of mined materials have been delivered to the [[id:b5d15d69-0f29-4147-b813-07098cf5085f][LHS 157]] system
to help [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biotech]] create new facilities.

Captain [[id:73023479-2655-4c13-a3d5-48e6d625ef5b][Maxim Lagunov]], in command of the [[id:4e26dabc-d7bd-4e6b-9619-7afb122f4ce8][Glorious Prospect]] megaship, announced: 

“This is the second time in recent weeks that our cargo bays have been
stocked with vital supplies to sustain [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth]]’s future. These
[[id:49673a62-e730-4833-9c29-dd6227e444a0][shipments]] of [[id:3de49bff-8041-45b0-a713-d3646334efd9][cobalt]], [[id:19346f59-fa1a-4ba2-8373-5b4d90f26662][gallite]] and [[id:89bb247d-d459-4ebf-a000-698cd1d9c5fe][osmium]] will be distributed to our
manufacturing teams, and we hope to construct new permanent facilities
in good time.”

“[[id:78d58f4a-e080-4548-a2f0-9506b7b73674][Torben Rademaker]] has authorised us to release funds to all pilots who
mined and delivered these materials. This initiative has played a
major role in helping to rebuild the corporation and continue our
important work.”

now. Pilots who have contributed to this initiative will shortly
receive a [[id:a5427e6e-e2f5-4c09-b595-97bbc14894ee][Mbooni]] system [[id:b2b2d9ee-9c33-4a0b-b3ce-82cfa362577e][permit]], providing individual contribution
