* Privateer’s Alliance Campaign Concludes

/13 Apr 3304/

A spokesperson for the Privateer’s Alliance has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Barjavel Station, the organisation’s base of operations. 

Construction will now begin on a new military installation in the HIP 33368 system to resist the Thargoid threat. 

The Privateer’s Alliance has extended its gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Barjavel Station in the HIP 33368 system.
