* INRA Descendant Murdered

/08 Jun 3304/

A descendant of Amaro Hem, one of the INRA’s senior members, has been murdered by terrorist group the League of Reparation. His body was found in the wreckage of a crashed ship. 

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, part of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League, provided a full explanation at a press conference: 

“We have identified the deceased as Luca Hem, an unemployed construction worker living at Houtman City in the Aeternitas system. He was reported missing by his family two weeks ago. We can confirm that he was the great-grandson of Amaro Hem, who was a programme coordinator with the INRA.” 

“Luca Hem’s body was found strapped into an ancient Cobra Mk III, the same model flown by Commander Jameson. Forensics indicate he was still alive when the ship struck an asteroid in the Aeternitas A Belt. The Cobra’s derelict condition suggests it wasn’t travelling under its own power, and was most likely salvaged from a scrapyard specifically for this purpose.” 

“According to logs discovered at the Taylor Keep INRA facility, Amaro Hem was responsible for ensuring that Jameson did not return from his mission against the Thargoids. This staged murder, recreating the circumstances of Jameson’s death, is obviously intended as an act of poetic justice by the League of Reparation.” 

“Luca Hem’s wife and children have been taken to secure locations for their own protection, as have nine individuals from other families related to Amaro Hem.” 

Agent Ramirez concluded: 

“It’s clear that the League is using theatrical tactics to ensure its message reaches the media. Our taskforce is working hard to discover more about this organisation, and to bring these terrorists to justice.”
