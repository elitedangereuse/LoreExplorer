* Galactic Mysteries: The Far God Cult

/19 Jul 3307/

The enigmatic Thargoid-worshipping religious order is examined by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency. 

“Of all the myriad faiths practised across the galaxy, the Far God cult is one of the strangest and least understood. But in recent years it has grown from a fringe sect to a widespread religion.” 

“Its central tenet is that an unknowable being exists beyond our dimension – the Far God. What we call the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] are its heralds, preparing for when it descends from hyperspace to instantly wipe out all life. This apocalyptic creed therefore attracts people who have nothing to live for, and who find purpose in awaiting armageddon.” 

“The cult has no official name or spokespeople, and its followers willingly replace their names with titles such as adherent, disciple and witness. This dehumanising approach includes its members wearing simple black robes and making their hive-chapels resemble [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] bio-technology, complete with ammonia fumes.” 

“Despite praying to an alien species, this is not the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] fifth column many feared it to be. In fact they are pacifistic fatalists, expecting death and never offering resistance. This has caused them to be victimised by other doomsayer cults, anti-xeno activists and even the Federal Intelligence Agency… yet their serene patience has allowed them to survive.” 

“The discovery of two abandoned void-temples in the Etain system provided an insight into the cultists’ mindset. Here can be heard the final testaments of people willingly entombed in suspended animation to await the Far God’s arrival.” 

“More recently there are reports of several chapters of the sect migrating to the Panjabell system. This is controlled by the Pleiades Concordat, a theocracy devoted to the Far God, so perhaps it is preparing something bigger – or stranger – than we’ve seen before.”
