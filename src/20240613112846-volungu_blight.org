| [[id:d31d3dd1-f63a-4ff2-9fa5-5031c4b7bf6c][Furbaide   

Reports began in February 3301 that despite the valiant efforts of medical staff in Liaedin, LHS 3505 and Furbaide the illness known as the Volungu Blight was spreading unchecked. Hundreds died in just 24 hours from the disease. A rapid-response medical team was sent to Effinger Port in the Furbaide system in an attempt to contain the spread. \ Aisling Duval arrived at Effinger Port to offer her assistance along with dozens of trained medical staff. Despite this intervention, the death toll reached thousands within a few days. \ By the end of the month the blight was contained after the pathogen was identified by Aisling Duval's team. By the time the cure was distributed, 3,505 people had lost their lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |
