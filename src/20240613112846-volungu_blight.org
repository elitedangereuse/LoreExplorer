[[id:d31d3dd1-f63a-4ff2-9fa5-5031c4b7bf6c][Furbaide]]

Reports began in February 3301 that despite the valiant efforts of
medical staff in [[id:867ef9a7-e1b0-4b85-b0b4-3036c0cb8e48][Liaedin]], [[id:c7e9e317-97fb-453b-bd7a-a52a61b5cafa][LHS 3505]] and [[id:d31d3dd1-f63a-4ff2-9fa5-5031c4b7bf6c][Furbaide]] the illness known as
the Volungu [[id:1cffca4e-480b-46bf-b6c5-0af48c7292d3][Blight]] was spreading unchecked. Hundreds died in just 24
hours from the disease. A rapid-response medical team was sent to
Effinger Port in the Furbaide system in an attempt to contain the
spread.

[[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] arrived at [[id:c110740a-38a9-4697-a8fd-e961f86e2b21][Effinger Port]] to offer her assistance along
with dozens of trained medical staff. Despite this intervention, the
death toll reached thousands within a few days.

By the end of the month the blight was contained after the pathogen
was identified by Aisling Duval's team. By the time the cure was
distributed, 3,505 people had lost their lives.
