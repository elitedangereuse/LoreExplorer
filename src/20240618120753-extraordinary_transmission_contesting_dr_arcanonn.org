* Extraordinary Transmission Contesting [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]]

/23 May 3301/

After recent terrorist activities in 78 Ursae Majoris, GalNet received multiple reports about a single transmission regarding [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]], that has been broadcast via various radio stations throughout known inhabited space simultaneously without their approval. 

GalNet was provided with a recording of the audio message: 

“It doesn’t matter who I am. My message is clear and simple. You have all been deceived by a charismatic individual calling himself a scientist, full of misled ambitions, going by the name of [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]]. He is taking advantage of the picture in your head of him being peaceful and reasonable for the greater good, but your support is being utilized and shamefully exploited. But who am I to trust? What do my words of prudence, my voice of sanity matter?” 

“Just look at his last statement, indirectly acknowledging terrorism, clearly showing that he is willing to do everything to achieve his own goals.” 

The voice goes on, describing the researcher’s various unsafe attempts to solve the artefact’s secrets and describing the Doctor’s demands for information as a masked attempt to sow the seeds of discord between them. The message closes with a call to stop the group’s support: 

“Don’t let yourself be fooled. Open your eyes and see the clear [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] unfolded in front of you. I’m asking for your sanity! Don’t let history repeat itself! Remember!” 

It is still unknown how the coordinated transmission was achieved, as it presents a serious effort. 

The respective station owners are also researching how that broadcast was routed into their programmes and deny any previous knowledge or even support to allow this transmission.
