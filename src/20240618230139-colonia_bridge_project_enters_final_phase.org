* [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge Project Enters Final Phase

/10 Feb 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Deliveries have been requested in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] and [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] systems to implement services to the Colonia Bridge starports. 

A press release from Brewer Corporation provided the details: 

“The fourth and final phase of our [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge project will take place over the next four weeks. Our goal is to finish constructing the starports that were recently added to the route between the Colonia and [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] systems.” 

“For the first week, we require deliveries of Coffee, Emergency Power Cells, Geological Equipment and Liquid Oxygen to Macdonald Settlement in the [[id:eb11ab9d-aab7-4d9b-aeaf-a228ef33d4da][Alcor]] system and [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] system. If we receive sufficient commodities, we can add Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics to all six stations.” 

“Everyone at Brewer Corporation was impressed by the galactic community’s dedication to improving the travel corridor to the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] region. For this week’s initiative, contributing pilots have the opportunity to be rewarded with a generous number of credits. In subsequent weeks, we will be offering a variety of additional rewards.” 

“Following feedback from our shareholders, we also plan to install beacons to recognise the major contributors to all phases of the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge project. The top ten contributors of every past and upcoming Colonia Bridge initiative will be listed on these beacons to immortalise the names of these pilots.” 

The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Bridge starports currently offer rearm, refuel and repair services as well as basic commodity trading. The second, third and fourth weeks of this phase will focus on adding further services.
