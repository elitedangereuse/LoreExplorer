* Bishop’s Congressional Bid Collapses

/04 Oct 3304/

Juanita Bishop, whose protest movement against the Far God cult gained broad support, has failed to be elected to Federal Congress. 

Independent political analyst Vaughan Niven published this summary: 

“Many of Juanita Bishop’s followers have abandoned her in the wake of Gethin Okonkwo’s investigation, which found no connection between the Far God sect and the Thargoids. As a result, Mrs Bishop’s congressional campaign has collapsed.” 

“There has also been a sea change in attitude within Congress itself. The majority of members have now taken a stand against Mrs Bishop for cultivating civil unrest and violating the Federation’s principles of religious freedom.” 

Juanita Bishop gave a forceful statement to the media: 

“If Congress can’t see that these people are dangerous, then they’re fools. These [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] spies need to be rounded up and executed before they murder us all. History will prove me right!”
