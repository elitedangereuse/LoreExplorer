* 0146 Atticus Ascension
[[id:a85c2248-39b0-4961-92ec-b21ee5ee7e36][Exioce]]

[[id:fca0838d-e7da-42e2-9656-590360079fa2][Atticus Obellan Duval]] ascended to the Imperial throne in 3081. His
arrival triggered noticeably less celebration and the man's dour and
bitter countenance was quickly noted as a contrast to the theatrically
inclined [[id:3b5b7101-a735-4d40-a48e-215cdcf06a27][Gaylen]]. In 3082 a second mission was sent to Exioce,
terraforming the planet Experiment and establishing a permanent
presence there, putting an end to Federal ambitions in the system.
