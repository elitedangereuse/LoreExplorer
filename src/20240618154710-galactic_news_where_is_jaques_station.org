* Galactic News: Where is [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station?

/13 Jun 3302/

Jaques Station hit the headlines two weeks ago when it was reported that the galaxy's most famous travelling starport had disappeared. [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]], the starport's owner and operator, had announced plans to jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point. But when contact with the starport was lost, many feared the ambitious enterprise had resulted in disaster. 

Fortunately it seems the starport is still intact, even if its whereabouts remain unknown. Several outposts throughout inhabited space have reported receiving messages over the past 24 hours, suggesting that the cyborg and his travelling starport survived the attempted journey to Beagle Point. 

Unfortunately the messages are extremely fragmentary, giving no clear indication of where the starport might be. One of the more complete messages reads as follows: 

"...witch-space...drive engines... station infrastructure intact but...we are..." 

We will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute reports on this issue.
