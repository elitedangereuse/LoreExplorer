* Freelance Report: Canonn Holds Press Conference

/04 Nov 3302/

The Canonn Interstellar Research Group held a press conference today to reassure the public that the ruins in the [[id:bfba5e37-ad9f-4fbb-a19c-5156313c79a4][Synuefe XR-H d11-102]] system were not being mishandled. 

A spokesperson for the organisation claimed that reports of damage at the site had been hugely exaggerated. 

"It's true that several scientific vessels were destroyed by rogue pilots, but we haven't observed any damage or contamination at the site." 

"As first on the scene, Canonn scientists and affiliates quickly got to work recording the artefacts at the site. Several hundred have already been disseminated to research institutes for analysis."
