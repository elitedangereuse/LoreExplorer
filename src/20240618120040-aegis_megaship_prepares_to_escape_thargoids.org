* Aegis Megaship Prepares to Escape Thargoids

/01 Jun 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

All independent ships aboard the Alexandria in the HIP 16538 system will be undocked on Thursday the 3rd of June. 

The megaship triggered an invasion of Thargoid vessels when it arrived from the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] system. Aegis believes this was a reaction to the large quantities of Guardian artefacts being stored in its cargo holds. 

Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, outlined the next steps: 

“On Thursday we will make a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system. Since this has a small population, the risk of casualties will be low if the Thargoids continue to pursue us. Once there, we will arrange to offload our cargo and distribute it to multiple locations.” 

“As a precaution, shortly before the jump we will uncouple all independent ships and leave them in the HIP 16538 system. We advise all pilots currently docked with the Alexandria to depart as soon as possible.” 

The Alexandria was ordered not to enter any Federal systems, causing many newsfeeds to refer to it as a ‘plague ship’. There are widespread concerns that it will attract Thargoids to any system it travels to.
