* Galactic News: Distress Call Received from Col 70 Sector

/20 Mar 3303/

Recent reports indicate that a [[id:f73ecba3-223e-494a-ad0e-0dac71699bf1][garbled]] [[id:384ade5a-7cbb-4f1a-85b6-aa38423886e7][distress call]] from somewhere in
the [[id:c8fe6fa0-8b82-4887-be3e-13422ca888a6][Col 70 sector]] has been received. The news has been met with
surprise from some quarters, given that [[id:b2b2d9ee-9c33-4a0b-b3ce-82cfa362577e][permit]] restrictions have made
the sector relatively inaccessible.

"We're not sure what to make of it," said [[id:1b48c230-52ef-4df7-a046-6659edf6338a][Perry Hussein]], a member of
the [[id:fb4d1189-972d-4599-a797-16392852f627][Federal intelligence community]], "but it was definitely a distress
call and the ship that sent it appears to have been [[id:c65c6053-6022-44e2-a1c7-ada136ecad65][destroyed]]. The
telemetry indicates it was an older vessel, perhaps [[id:83299a14-b6b0-4670-ba39-2914e05ed2f5][Cobra]] class."
