#+title: First [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Contact
The first recorded contact between humanity and the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] took
place in 3125, although it has been speculated that there were
encounters, albeit ones with no human survivors or witnesses.

A holo clip of the encounter showed showing a brief glimpse of the
alien ship, and analysis of the footage revealed characters on the
hull reminiscent of the letters 'THARG'. Some argued the characters
might in fact be some kind of symbol, but the word nevertheless fell
into popular use, giving rise to the name 'Thargoid'.

In the years that followed, scores of encounters with [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessels
were reported, but little concrete evidence emerged, and for a long
time nothing more was learned about these mysterious aliens.
