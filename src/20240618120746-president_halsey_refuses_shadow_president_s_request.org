* President Halsey Refuses Shadow President’s Request

/09 May 3301/

The office of President [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] has today issued a statement refusing Shadow President Hudson’s demand to meet him for a live presidential debate on ‘Face the People’. 

James Speakes, the President’s Press Secretary, had this to say on the matter: 

“The President is of course happy to debate the Shadow President on policy. President Halsey welcomes any opportunity to talk about the many wonderful programmes she’s instigated since taking office. Sadly in this instance, prior engagements keep her from being able to attend such a debate.” 

“As President of the Federation, Jasmina Halsey’s schedule is booked months in advance. Clearing her entire schedule for the next two weeks simply to take part in a debate against the Shadow President is not something that the President felt that she could do. If Shadow President Hudson still wishes to debate President Halsey when she returns from her trip, then the President will be more than happy to oblige him.”
