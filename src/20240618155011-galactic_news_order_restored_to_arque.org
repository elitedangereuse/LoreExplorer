* Galactic News: Order Restored to Arque

/25 Aug 3302/

Arque Commodities has announced that its campaign to clear the Arque system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in the Arque system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at Austen Town Station.
