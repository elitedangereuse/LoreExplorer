* Galactic News: Order Restored to [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]]

/25 Aug 3302/

Arque Commodities has announced that its campaign to clear the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the criminals operating in the system. 

Authorities in the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. 

Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at Austen Town Station.
