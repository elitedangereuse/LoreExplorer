* Azimuth A Historical Perspective (Part Three)

/28 Jun 3308/

An overview of how Aegis was impacted by the rise of [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] as a competing anti-xeno force. 

“For now I cannot provide you with my credentials. Suffice to say that I am a man of science, unconnected with modern politics. I am recruiting agents to investigate the work undertaken by [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]] two hundred years ago, which I believe to be of enormous scientific importance. Much has been lost in that time, but our dedication will allow us to rewrite history.” 

This was how the anonymous figure known only as [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] introduced himself to Pilots’ Federation members in April 3307. Faceless and voiceless, he remains unseen to the present day. His messages characterised him as a dedicated scientist, one with enormous confidence in achieving his goal to destroy the Thargoids and “save all of humanity”. 

It was clear that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] possessed detailed knowledge about [[id:e68a5318-bd72-4c92-9f70-dcdbd59505d1][Azimuth Biochemicals]], without which the Hesperus would not have been discovered. He began recruiting independent pilots to undertake missions via the intermediary of Taurus Mining Ventures, a corporation based in the remote T Tauri system. 

After locating the Proteus in June 3307, [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] claimed exclusive rights to exploit the ancient Guardian-Thargoid battleground on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a. This was contested by Aegis, but their initiative to gather Guardian artefacts from the site was eclipsed by Taurus Mining Ventures’s campaign. In a short time, Salvation successfully emerged as a rival to Aegis, claiming that the tri-superpower agency could not be trusted. 

This was reinforced after the tragic loss of the Alexandria megaship. Due to its cargo of Guardian artefacts, Thargoids had relentlessly pursued the megaship before it vanished in hyperspace. An independent inquiry into the disaster ordered Aegis’s operations to be suspended, leaving an absence that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] was keen to exploit. 

In September 3307, [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] warned of an impending Thargoid attack in the Cornsar system, apparently detected by his version of Eagle Eye. Aegis and local factions dismissed this as highly unlikely, but nevertheless Thargoid vessels did swarm into the system. 

Salvation again reached out to pilots and asked them to transport vital equipment from a Taurus Mining Ventures megaship to Cornsar, for a prototype weapon that he was constructing. A counter-initiative took place by Commanders who distrusted [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] or supported Aegis, illustrating that each now had their supporters among the galactic community. 

Four days later, the Thargoid invasion force unexpectedly vanished from Cornsar. Most withdrew into hyperspace, but crashed alien vessels remained on some planetary bodies. [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] revealed he had developed an anti-xeno superweapon, capable of eliminating the Thargoid presence from an entire star system. “I have achieved what Aegis could not – an effective deterrent against the alien threat.” 

The nature of this incredible new weapon remained unclear, but evidence of Guardian technology later found in Cornsar raised a disturbing possibility. Did [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] really detect the approaching Thargoid fleet Or did he deliberately attract the Thargoids to Cornsar by stockpiling huge quantities of Guardian artefacts – as happened on the Alexandria – in order to test his prototype superweapon. 

As a Vox Galactica report put it “Time will tell if [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s ambition to replace Aegis is a noble goal, or if we are replacing the devil we know with a darker demon.”
