* [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] ‘Hunter’ Vessel Class Confirmed

/18 May 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

A new type of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessel, first encountered within the Maelstroms, is interdicting ships in Thargoid controlled systems. 

Aegis highlighted the threat as part of its research into the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] capital ships. Commodore Emil Varga, the Allied military liaison, gave this statement: 

“The first explorers to breach the Maelstroms’ inner regions encountered a previously unseen [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] vessel, larger than a scout but smaller than an interceptor. These medium-sized craft have been categorised as hunters, with this specific class designated the ‘Glaive’ due to its blade-like protrusions.” 

“The Glaives operated close to the motherships, so it was initially believed they acted as sentries. But in recent days they have appeared within systems under [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] control. Pilots lucky enough to survive these encounters report being forced out of supercruise by Glaives and aggressively attacked.” 

“Personally, I believe that our newfound ability to penetrate the Maelstroms caught the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] by surprise. In response, they have redeployed the mothership’s defenders to a more offensive role. Such rapid tactical adaptation is not typical of this species, which is a good indicator that we have them worried.” 

Aden Tanner provided more details following a research mission: 

“The Glaive is extremely aggressive and attacks any human ship within range. Its high-intensity energy weapons take the form of lightning bolts, similar to a [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] interceptor, but this vessel is faster and more manoeuvrable.” 

“Anti-xeno pilots should be advised that Glaives are also capable of disabling Guardian-based weaponry. This only became apparent when encountering them outside of the Maelstrom systems, where the Thargoids’ anti-Guardian field is permanently present.”
