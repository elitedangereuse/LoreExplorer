* [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] Cult Praises Alien Victory

/16 Aug 3308/

A breakaway sect of the Thargoid-worshipping fringe religion is apparently celebrating the massacre of human forces in the HIP 22460 system. 

A message was broadcast from the Testament megaship by the anonymous woman known only as the First Apostle of the True Chapters: 

“We rejoice in the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]]’s triumph! Those who tried to desecrate the dark angels have paid the price. The Far God is calling to us from the higher dimensions, and Its manifestation is closer than ever before. It is coming.” 

There has been widespread outrage at [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] believers for their joyous reaction to the many thousands of deaths in HIP 22460. Some political and military leaders have even called for the ‘alien-loving traitors’ to be arrested as enemy agents. However, there is no evidence that they have any actual relationship with the Thargoid species other than idolisation. 

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented: 

“Despite its unusual belief system, and notwithstanding the poor taste of the First Apostle’s remarks, we should support the evolution of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult toward a more structured framework. We must also remember that it is a lawful institution, and only establishes hive-chapels in systems with legislation that protects religious liberty.” 

Authorities in several of those systems have stated that local [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] chapters are experiencing a surge in recruitment. Anecdotal reports suggest that these newest members are convinced the Second Thargoid War is already lost, and that humanity’s extinction is as inevitable as the cult has always claimed.
