* Freelance Report: Dr Arcanonn Appeals for Help

/05 Aug 3302/

The image transmitted by the mysterious Unknown Probes is still a mystery. But while the image occupies his teams, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group believes there is more to discover about the Probes themselves. The problem is supply. 

"The only known sources of Unknown Probes are Federal military convoys in the Ross 47, G 99-49, Wolf 294 and Wolf 504 systems." 

"The Federal military apparently knows where the Probes can be found, but they're keeping it a secret, so it's up to us to lift the veil." 

"Since Unknown Artefacts are found in a 135-150 light year shell around Merope, we believe the probes are in a similar region â€“ possibly even the same region. We also think they will be found in anomalous signal sources, the same as the Artefacts." 

"So please help science, and break the Federal monopoly on these Probes. It could be the most important thing you ever do." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
