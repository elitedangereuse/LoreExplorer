* Galactic News: Aegis Initiative off to a Promising Start

/08 Dec 3303/

Reports from the Taygeta system indicate that Aegis’s new research programme is already bearing fruit. 

Professor Boden Tench, principal researcher at Titan's Daughter, offered the following statement to Universal Scientist: 

“We’re currently focusing on the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Probes and Sensors, and we’ve already learned a great deal about the way the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] transmit and store information.” 

“We’ve also been studying the star maps found inside [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] structures. We still don’t know the precise purpose of these maps, but our analysis has revealed some intriguing details about how the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] categorise geographical data. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that their concepts of territory differ dramatically from our own.”
