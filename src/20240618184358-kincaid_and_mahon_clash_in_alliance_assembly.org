* Kincaid and Mahon Clash in Alliance Assembly

/26 Apr 3305/

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has once again clashed with President Gibson Kincaid, following the latter’s attempt to take control of government policy during an Assembly session.  

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune: 

“There were dramatic scenes in the Assembly as President Kincaid sought to steer debates on military strategy, making several demands for increased funding towards new fleets.” 

“Prime Minister Mahon eventually stepped in and rejected these proposals outright. Kincaid was further reminded that a prior request for executive presidential powers had been unsuccessful, even if he insists on behaving otherwise.” 

“Although he still has supporters, a number of councillors have privately opined that Kincaid is now a toxic presence at odds with the Alliance’s ethos.”
