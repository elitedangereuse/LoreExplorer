* The Assault on Indra

/05 Jul 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation Alert*  

Titan Indra is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of the fifth Titan. 

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships: 

• Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – To break through the maelstrom defence wave. 

• Caustic Sink Launchers – To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom. 

• Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon – To hamper the Titan’s vents and make it vulnerable to damage. 

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat. 

Good luck, Commanders.
