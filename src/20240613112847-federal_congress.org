*     0161  Federal Congress
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]

Federal Congress is made up of 500 Congressmen (the term for both men and women). They sit in Congress, which is in Olympus Village on Mars - which replaced its location in Washington DC early in the previous millenium.

Congressmen are elected for an eight year term, along with a President, with a 'vote of no confidence' after four years. If the vote if no confidence succeeds then a full election takes place. A Congressman (or President) cannot serve multiple consecutive terms.

Every Federation system has representation in Congress, but generally a Congressman represents multiple systems, except a few (like Sol) that have more than one Congressional representative, based loosely on historic population. Phenomenal growth in the outer systems has meant that they have have little representation in the Congress, and there is frequent discussion about creating many new Congressmen to address this balance, but the various power blocks realise it will change the balance of power away from the core systems, the very people who would have to vote it through - so many agree it is unlikely to happen in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |   |   |   |
