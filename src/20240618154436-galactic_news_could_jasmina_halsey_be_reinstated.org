* Galactic News: Could [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] be Reinstated?

/16 Mar 3302/

Following the extraordinary rescue of former Federal president [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]], whose escape pod was recovered from the wreckage of [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]], questions have been asked about her possible return to power. According to an anonymous source within the Federal government, several senior-level politicians have voiced the opinion that, should she make a full recovery, Halsey ought to be allowed to serve out the remainder of her term. 

Simon Newell, a legal advisor to the Federal government, spoke to the Federal Times earlier today. 

 "There's no direct precedent for this situation, so it's hard to be certain. I know some members of government believe Halsey should be reinstated, but my feeling is that such an outcome is unlikely. When Halsey disappeared she was already facing a vote of no confidence, and her presidency was officially terminated so a new president could be elected. My suspicion is that if there were a legal challenge, the law would uphold the vote of no confidence recorded at the time."
