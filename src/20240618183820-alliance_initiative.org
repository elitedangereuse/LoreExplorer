* Alliance Initiative

/27 Jul 3304/

The Alliance has announced plans to build an Ocellus starport in the MEL 22 Sector GM-V C2-8 system, to further bridge the gap between the core systems and the Alliance’s outposts in the California Nebula. 

Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement: 

“Our previous initiative established a link between our outposts in the California Nebula and the galactic core. But to ensure the safety and wellbeing of travellers following the route, we need to maintain a robust programme of starport construction.” 

The initiative is being overseen by the Turner Research Group, which has placed an open order for mined resources to be used in the construction. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 26th of July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
