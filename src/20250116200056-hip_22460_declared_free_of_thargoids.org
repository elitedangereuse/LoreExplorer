* HIP 22460 Declared Free of Thargoids

/16 Jan 3311/

[[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] has confirmed that [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] shows zero sign of Thargoid
activity following a blockade organised by [[id:191fb0ed-5a88-4a49-a98d-e25794c5b36b][AXI]] and [[id:795e99a1-cd10-4768-8155-0d5cd0af6e10][XSF]] forces.

It is theorised that the Thargoids have maintained a varying presence
in the HIP 22460 system since at least 3303, due to reports recovered
from the now-abandoned [[id:117f59dd-4f18-47a4-88a1-ac5b3088b78a][Fort Asch]] laboratory. After the Proteus Wave
weapon in the system in 3308, Thargoids aggressively swarmed the
system until recently.

But AX forces sought to change this over the past few weeks, and the
signal from Aegis’ military advisor [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]] indicates that the
system is now fully under human control. Tanner himself provided a
message of thanks:

“The impeccable efforts of AXI, XSF and allied AX pilots have finally
brought peace to one more system. I only wish I was young enough to
join these heroes out on the front lines. These pilots have provided a
great service to humanity, and all here at Aegis salute them.”
