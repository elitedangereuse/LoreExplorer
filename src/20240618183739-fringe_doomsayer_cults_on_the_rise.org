* Fringe Doomsayer Cults on the Rise

/19 May 3304/

An increasing number of religious movements in the core systems are proclaiming that humanity is on the verge of destruction. 

Awareness of the issue has been raised by independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo, who published an article outlining the phenomenon: 

“The return of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] has led to the emergence of dozens of radical groups. Although their nature varies, the message is the same: the apocalypse is coming.” 

“Some of these groups are distinctly religious in flavour. The Church of the Eternal Void, for example, preaches that the war for human souls is almost lost. Their view of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] as ‘demons from a hellish universe’ and [[id:f57cff55-3348-45ea-b76f-d0eaa3c68165][the Guardians]] as ‘beings of light who have decreed us unworthy of salvation’ runs along classic theological lines.” 

“Others, such as Generation Omega, stoically accept that our time is almost over. They state that ‘superior spacefaring lifeforms will naturally destroy inferior ones, just as our own cultures have overrun each other since prehistory’. Generation Omega plans to build mass euthanasia centres for planetary populations, declaring that the human era deserves to end in a dignified manner.” 

“Of course there have always been ‘doomsayers’, and naturally our governments refuse to accept them as legitimate. But that hasn’t stopped these organisations from attracting thousands of citizens and millions of credits, with their followers growing in number rapidly.” 

“During wartime, many people become desperate for the certainty that such belief systems provide. We are likely to see these radical elements increase their influence as long as the shadow of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] falls over us.” 

Authorities in the core systems responded to Okonkwo’s article by restating that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] threat is being controlled and that such fearmongering is unwarranted.
