* Campaign for New Xeno-Research Centre

/07 Feb 3305/

Dr [[id:d5ca99a6-ded7-43fb-bc1e-83a622b49c50][Roy Casimir]] of the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] has announced
plans to construct a research centre focusing on new life forms
discovered by the galactic community:

“The development of the [[id:1f629124-e470-420f-ae19-d55c66bb97c5][Codex]] has led to a number of [[id:4e827915-3759-4040-97d0-346eac70fb5e][xenological]]
discoveries. Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility
to analyse these incredible [[id:01ddb7a3-3a00-4fa6-b3b0-7dcdf01be1b2][lifeforms]].”

“We therefore request quantities of [[id:3de49bff-8041-45b0-a713-d3646334efd9][Cobalt]], [[id:9fbdd62c-a62a-45d1-9ee5-9ab7980a4fd6][Indium]] and [[id:d10c0435-4bc8-42ac-bea6-228d2f02604c][Tantalum]] to be
delivered to [[id:e7277813-d4d3-496c-8fe5-e5f540ff5ef3][Williams Vision]] in the [[id:3efd571e-0167-4167-bf6c-67b4650259ce][Nahuaru]] system.”

“In addition, we ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which
will form the core of our xenological research catalogue. [[id:f38f6f14-2b32-4ace-b352-41a5bac00d32][Nahuaru
Crimson Bridge Int]] has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse
contributing pilots.”

The initiative begins on the 7th of February 3305 and will run for one
week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign
will end immediately.
