* Imperial Senate Considers Marlinist Diplomacy

/28 Jun 3307/

A proposal for the Empire to formally open diplomatic relations with the Marlinist Colonies has been made by Senator Lorcan Scordato. 

The eight systems are populated by ex-Imperial citizens who fled to avoid persecution for their beliefs in Marlinism, which advocates democratic representation. 

Returning from a fact-finding mission to the colonies, Senator Scordato told the Senate: 

“The Marlinist community is primarily focused on peaceful co-existence alongside the Empire, rather than trying to reform the Republic of Achenar. And now that Minister Aaron Whyte speaks for the Neo-Marlinists, we have an opportunity to prevent further extremist actions via diplomacy.” 

Although some senators agreed, others such as [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] stressed that “As a matter of honour and principle, the Empire does not negotiate with terrorists.” 

Several newsfeeds observed that both the Alliance and the Federation are looking into opening formal diplomatic channels with the Marlinist Colonies. Similar debates have occurred in the Assembly and Congress regarding the acceptance of an [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] political wing. 

First Minister Jenna Fairfax has repeated calls for the Marlinism Reformation Party to cease representing the Neo-Marlinist fringe. However, she also announced plans for a Marlinist equivalent to the Imperial Diplomatic Corps that would undertake ambassadorial duties.
