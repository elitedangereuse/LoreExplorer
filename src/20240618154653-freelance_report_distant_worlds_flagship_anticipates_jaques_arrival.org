* Freelance Report: Distant Worlds Flagship Anticipates [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]' Arrival

/14 May 3302/

Preparations are underway for the Distant Worlds Expedition gala at Skvortsov Orbital, but one explorer will be unable to attend: Commander Olivia Vespera, pilot of the expedition's fleet flagship, a Type-9 named Zombie Wasp IV. 

At the time of writing, Commander Vespera is still at Beagle Point, prospecting for the necessary materials to synthesize 'jumponium', a colloquial moniker given by explorers to frame shift drive injection. Without it, Vespera will be unable to return home. 

But Commander Vespera is unconcerned â€“ in fact, she's jubilant. 

"I got a message saying that [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station is coming to Beagle Point. I might actually be the first to meet him here!"
