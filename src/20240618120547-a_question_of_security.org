* A Question of Security

/17 Feb 3301/

During a gathering of patrons held on Eotienses earlier today, Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] received a standing ovation after delivering a stirring speech on the importance of internal security. 

“We live in uncertain times my friends,” the Senator began. “The health of the Emperor is failing and the wolves are at our door. Even here, close to the very heart of our Empire, there are dangers lurking in every shadow.” 

The Senator went on to say: 

“It might surprise you to learn that just 30 mere lightyears from where we stand bloody handed chaos reigns supreme. The criminals of Falisci use their privileged sovereignty to peck away at law abiding Imperial states, and they are far from the only ones to do so. Is it not our honour bound duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves? We must purge the Empire of these parasites in our midst. Only then will we be free to achieve our true destiny.”
