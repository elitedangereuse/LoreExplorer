A rare commodity sold at [[id:b08b812a-f510-420c-b5f2-15cc3897ece2][Stasheff Colony]] in [[id:0a1cb833-3b43-4525-b28b-fb2603051efa][HIP 80364]]

#+begin_quote
The high phosphorous content of this powerful pesticide is highly
effective, but can cause a number of highly dangerous side
effects. This has led to some governments classifying it as a chemical
weapon, and many independent agricultural worlds taking legal action
against the producer after cattle and workers have been left maimed.

This rare good is legal in all systems except for Independent
Co-operative and Communist systems and Alliance Co-operative systems.
