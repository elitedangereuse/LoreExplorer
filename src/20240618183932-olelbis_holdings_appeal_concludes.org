* Olelbis Holdings Appeal Concludes

/22 Nov 3304/

A spokesperson for Olelbis Holdings has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering goods to Polyakov Orbital, and by eliminating agitators in Olelbis, thereby ensuring the safety of traders. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Polyakov Orbital in the Olelbis system.
