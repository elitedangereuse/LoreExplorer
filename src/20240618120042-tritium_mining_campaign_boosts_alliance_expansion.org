* Tritium Mining Campaign Boosts Alliance Expansion

/03 Jun 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]]’s request for mined tritium has concluded, paving the way for new Alliance starports. 

Large quantities of tritium were delivered, which will provide fuel for a civil infrastructure programme designed to increase the Alliance’s presence.  

As part of this expansion, new Alliance starports will be constructed in these systems by the 25th of June 3307:

Prime Minister Mahon, who was recently re-elected by the Assembly, told the media: 

“The economy of the Alliance will benefit greatly from investment in expansion. These new stations will provide more opportunities for individuals and corporations alike.” 

Pilots who mined and delivered tritium can now collect their rewards from Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.
