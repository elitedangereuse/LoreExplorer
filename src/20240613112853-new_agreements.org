* 0172 New Agreements
[[id:144149ef-21cd-4e52-afea-dcf379d12d18][Altair]]

The renewed sense of purpose this strategy brought to the planet
extended outwards to the interstellar colonies. Agreements were
reached with [[id:0def2d80-7010-4455-b926-9354a9142b07][Beta-Hydri]] and Altair. In exchange for further
self-determination each system agreed to maintain and preserve the
natural habitats of indigenous life in their star systems. Shortly
after this, Delta Pavonis also joined this agreement to act with
restraint should any further life be discovered in the
system.
