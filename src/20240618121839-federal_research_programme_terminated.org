* Federal Research Programme Terminated

/20 Sep 3301/

Federal [[id:112b5795-655f-4cc1-9995-b7aa39cb27c4][Research]] Programme Terminated 
 
Reports have begun circulating that the Federal research programme
established last week to study the so-called ‘[[id:3b903a70-280c-4b0c-8240-e97c4c970d92][anomalous]]
[[id:193cf057-7f74-4842-b9a8-af825a04e7e6][extraterrestrial]] objects’ (or AEOs) has been terminated. This news
comes only a week after the inauguration of the project.

According to a source at [[id:cf35447b-c4b9-4450-83ad-830b1af13cfa][Fort Harrison]], where the programme was based,
study of the objects was brought to an abrupt halt by the station
governor, [[id:d61b7c78-a45a-48cd-bcab-4a0d30b83661][Aoishe Quaid]]. Apparently, Quaid ordered the head of the
project, Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]], to immediately cease his
research. The reason for Quaid’s decision is not known, although it is
not believed to have been informed by concerns over public [[id:33a46531-2d6b-460d-8b56-b5c81acd8c42][safety]].

A second source from Fort Harrison, who asked not to be named, had the
following to say:

“Frankly, I don’t think it was Quaid’s decision at all – I think she
was pressured into shutting the programme down. She was enthusiastic
about the project and had a lot of respect for Professor Palin, so
this change of direction just doesn’t make sense. The question is, who
forced her to [[id:d6b96fb1-c922-4d7c-b249-26fa1c650f23][cancel]] the research, and why?”

The objects under study were described as [[id:f73e6c5a-b8aa-409c-9ee9-e81039144897][quasi-organic]] in nature and
capable of [[id:9e7b9200-31ec-4163-b258-f4fa04346d42][broadcasting]] location data across vast distances. Their
discovery was widely considered the scientific find of the decade, and
the cancellation of the project will no doubt provoke a strong
response from the scientific community.

Professor Palin declined to comment on the Governor Quaid’s decision.
