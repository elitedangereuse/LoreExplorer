/17 Jan 3305/

The conflict in the Paresa system has ended with Nova Imperium being defeated by Imperial organisation Yupini Limited. 

As the conflict drew to a close, Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] made the following statement: 

“With the aid of our loyal Imperial auxiliaries, the isolationists’ forces have been significantly depleted. Let this be a warning to others – [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] will not tolerate insurrection.” 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Dyson City in the Paresa system.
