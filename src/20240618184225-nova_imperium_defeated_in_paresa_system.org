* Nova Imperium Defeated in Paresa System

/17 Jan 3305/

The conflict in the Paresa system has ended with Nova Imperium being defeated by Imperial organisation Yupini Limited. 

As the conflict drew to a close, Senator Denton Patreus made the following statement: 

“With the aid of our loyal Imperial auxiliaries, the isolationists’ forces have been significantly depleted. Let this be a warning to others – the Empire will not tolerate insurrection.” 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Dyson City in the Paresa system.
