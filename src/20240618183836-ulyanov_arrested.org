* Ulyanov Arrested

/18 Aug 3304/

Dr [[id:2bf69df4-bf62-4877-87eb-5158254f5fcb][Alfred Ulyanov]], a leading exotheologian and an authority on the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult, has been apprehended as a suspected Thargoid sympathiser. 

The arrest took place at Dr Ulyanov’s home in the Rana system, where he and his family were taken into custody by the Federal Intelligence Agency. Research materials and computer systems were also removed from the property, according to witnesses. 

Professor Siobhan Vogel of the Interstellar Association of Universities registered a formal complaint: 

“For Dr Ulyanov’s academic studies to be viewed as evidence that he is some kind of Thargoid agent is utterly ridiculous. This violation of his rights sets a dangerous precedent.” 

Federal Intelligence Agency Senior Agent Micah Whitefield gave the following statement: 

“When it comes to possible Thargoid allies, we cannot afford to overlook anything. Dr Ulyanov’s involvement with the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult makes him a valid person of interest. We are also investigating the Galactic Interfaith Commune, the Spiritual Freedom Movement and other organisations that have supported Thargoid worshippers.” 

Juanita Bishop, whose campaign against the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] sect has continued to attract popular support, commented: 

“This proves that there are Thargoid collaborators among us, in all walks of life. We must root them out before they start murdering innocent people.”
