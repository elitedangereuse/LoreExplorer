Previously known as the [[id:f16a32d5-814d-4446-935d-32c4edfc4c42][Cisco Corporation]], [[id:ebaea4eb-8ba1-4f48-ada6-ca694704143b][WorldCraft]] is based in the
Epsilon Eridani system and has been the [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][Federation]]'s favourite tourist
resort for more then three hundred years.

For centuries Woldcraft (then Cisco) was a major tourist corporation,
running tourist resorts throughout human space. It was a big customer
of [[id:e8554355-4cee-41f8-9edf-c8c4bbbaf25a][Free World Ventures]] 'Worldcraft' atmospheric processing units as it
began to create whole tourist resort planets in the early part of the
33rd century. To exclude its competitors from this market, it bought
FMV in a hostile takeover in 3260 via a leveraged buyout - doubling
the size of the corporation in one step, and renamed the whole
corporation to 'WorldCraft' (with a capital 'C' in the middle) based
on this operation, as at that point Cisco was associated with a broad
range of holidays, including the seedier end of the market - something
that had prevented Cisco from sucessfully entering the Imperial
market. The 'WorldCraft' brand was highly respected, including in
Imperial space, and the change was made in the hope of being more
acceptable to the [[id:8ec888bf-bc94-41a6-a316-c0b3af0c778f][Empire]].
