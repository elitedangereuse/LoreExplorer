* ‘Thargoid Roar’ Leaked to Public

/15 Sep 3308/

Classified audio-visual footage from the Battle of HIP 22460 has been anonymously submitted to several mainstream newsfeeds. 

The Alliance Tribune, [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]], The Imperial Herald, The Sovereign and Vox Galactica all received databanks salvaged from various wreckages in the HIP 22460 system. Most were obtained from naval vessels, along with a handful recovered from independent ship’s logs. 

Superpower-based newsfeeds elected not to publish any information related to their own militaries, citing security guidelines. But enough material has reached the public domain to portray the sequence of events of August 9th: the activation of the Proteus Wave, the Thargoid counter-attack, and the subsequent destruction of huge numbers of ships. 

These files include audio recordings of a broadcast of unknown origin that occurred throughout HIP 22460. They match previously unverified descriptions of a so-called ‘Thargoid roar’, something that has been discussed by independent journalist Flint Lafosse and Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn. 

Several interpretations of this unearthly sound have been offered. Professor Shamus Madigan believed it to be “residual electromagnetic radiation from the Thargoids’ energy pulse on HIP 22460 10b”. Dr Jeong-Hui Shin theorised that it was “a burst of frenzied communication to – or from – some distant location”. Meanwhile, the First Apostle of the True Chapters claimed: “The voice of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] calls to the faithful. The manifestation has begun.” 

Coupled with the Thargoid expansion from HIP 22460 and their recent invasion of three inhabited systems, this new revelation has fuelled public anxiety over the Thargoid threat. Members of the Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have reassured their citizens that there is no need for panic. It is believed that several intelligence agencies have opened investigations into the source of the leak, the content of which is believed to have been classified by military departments. 

Anti-Thargoid operations are continuing in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems. The Federation has submitted several Farragut-class battle cruisers to help repel Thargoid forces. Local factions organising the defensive efforts have called for independent pilots to join the fight.
