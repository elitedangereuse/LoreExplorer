* Emperor Approves Aisling’s Plan for Aegis

/31 Jan 3309/

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] met with Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] in person to discuss an Imperial contribution to the reformation of Aegis. 

The Imperial Herald’s political journalist Cassia Carvalho reported on events: 

“Aisling Duval’s arrival at the Imperial Palace was completely unexpected, according to several dignitaries whose appointed meetings with the Emperor were abruptly cancelled. One senatorial aide described how the princess ‘burst into the throne room so suddenly that I’m surprised the Imperial Guard didn’t shoot her’.” 

“Despite visible irritation, Emperor Arissa acceded to Princess Aisling’s demand for urgent talks. The two royals held a private conversation behind closed doors for many hours. I heard claims of raised voices at one stage, but nobody was willing to go on record to confirm this.” 

“Eventually, Her Majesty call for the media to assemble, which we did eagerly. The Emperor made it clear that her decree to isolate from the other superpowers remained active. However, if Aegis were to be re-established, a limited number of scientists and naval vessels would be allocated to the anti-xeno agency. Princess Aisling would take ownership of the endeavour, and coordinate with both Imperial and foreign organisations.” 

“Senators and Imperial Navy officials were surprised by this exception to the Emperor’s policy. But political analysts remarked on the shrewdness of making Princess Aisling personally responsible for the proposed anti-xeno collaboration, thereby distancing the Emperor from any potential failures.” 

“Insiders claim that Princess Aisling has already requested members for her delegation including Senator Caspian Leopold, Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson  and xenological specialist Ivano Colombera. She has also tasked the Imperial Diplomatic Corps with re-opening diplomatic channels to the Alliance and Federation, specifically to share information about [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]]’s respective proposals for a reformed Aegis.”
