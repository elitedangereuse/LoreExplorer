* Flashpoint for Nova Imperium

/11 Jan 3305/

Political journalist Cassia Carvalho has reported on the current conflict with isolationist group Nova Imperium: 

“In recent weeks, Nova Imperium has become a genuine political force. Tensions have now erupted into open conflict in the Paresa system, with Imperial Navy auxiliaries attempting to destroy Nova Imperium’s fleet.” 

“In return, Imperator Mordanticus has called on the galactic community to fight for Emperor Hengist’s long-lost grandson Hadrian Duval to be recognised as an heir to the throne.” 

“Whether this is a one-off battle or the beginning of an Imperial civil war, the outcome of the Battle of Paresa will influence the future of the Empire.”
