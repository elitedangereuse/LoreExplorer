* Galactic News: Perpetrators of Darnielle's Progress Heist Identified

/24 Mar 3303/

Three of the five individuals responsible for the recent theft of
[[id:da2f167d-0157-4deb-afb2-98bf6518cf01][meta-alloys]] from [[id:b4d90e11-7f9a-42f4-a995-4ca941d38851][Darnielle's Progress]] have been positively identified,
following analysis of starport security footage. Remarkably, one of
the perpetrators has been acknowledged as Commander [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Salomé]], also known
as Kahina Tijani Loren.

Loren was sentenced to life imprisonment last year for the attempted
murder of Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]], but when her convoy was destroyed en
route to [[id:974fe20f-15c8-4fbc-a351-746c6598137e][Koontz Asylum]] it was assumed she had been killed.

Responding to the news, Imperial authorities promptly placed a
galaxy-wide bounty on Salomé to the tune of 500,000 credits.

Meanwhile, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] released a brief statement: 

"Commander Salomé is a disgraced senator and a convicted murderer. She
incites violence wherever she goes, and in the interest of public
safety she must be stopped. I urge all those loyal to [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] to
deliver justice to this criminal."

Salomé's accomplices have been identified as former [[id:f778f4fa-9cd0-4e2c-b3f4-6ee7adac4d03][MetaDrive]] employee
[[id:4ab3e632-de21-44bc-a834-83b808a737ec][Raan Corsen]] – previously believed deceased – and former Junior
Alliance operative [[id:7bc38ab5-1b0b-4821-a335-41be23b62612][Tsu Annabelle Singh]]. [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][The Empire]] has placed sizeable
bounties on both individuals.

Imperial military sources issued the following advice to those
interested in pursuing these bounties:

"These individuals should be considered armed and dangerous. Make no
attempt to communicate with them. Shoot on sight. Visual evidence of a
target's death will guarantee the relevant bounty."

Salomé's current location is unknown, but she is believed to have fled
the core systems.
