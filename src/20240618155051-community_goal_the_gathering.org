* Community Goal: The Gathering

/13 Oct 3302/

Each year, the Annual Galactic Games Organisation holds an elaborate gaming tournament known as the Gathering, enticing the rich and famous to a chosen system for a week-long party. 

This year's event will take place at the Norman â€“ Mavis's Bingo Palace starport in the Aramzahd system, chosen for its proximity to the lush planet of Guardinia. In addition to the games, there will be historical flight displays and presentations from many of the galaxy's premier ship manufacturers. System authorities have welcomed the event, which is expected to attract thousands of guests and bring in millions of credits. 

In anticipation of the event, the Aramzahd Empire Party has placed an open order for Centauri Mega Gin, Giant Irukama Snails, Lavian Brandy, Tanmark Tranquil Tea and Witchhaul Kobe Beef. Pilots who deliver these commodities to Norman - Mavis's Bingo Palace in the Aramzahd system will be generously rewarded. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Aramzahd, to ensure the safety of those attending the event. 

The campaign begins on the 13th October 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
