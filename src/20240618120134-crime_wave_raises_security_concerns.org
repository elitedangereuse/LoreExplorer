* Crime Wave Raises Security Concerns

/22 Nov 3307/

An expert larcenist known as the [[id:b9519a7c-f00b-4a57-9bcf-964258bdd2d8][Winking Cat]] has triggered widespread
alarm with a spree of high-profile [[id:f15a269f-7b00-45dd-a4e5-632d0a37ad95][thefts]].

[[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]] published this feature by crime correspondent [[id:39c4c90a-eb6a-4306-b1a4-b95ff114a428][Mira
Bukowski]] :

“Last month, the galaxy’s most infamous thief reappeared in the
headlines after a long absence. It appears the Winking Cat is making
up for lost time by stealing multiple items in quick succession.”

“One notable target was a portrait of Emperor [[id:164e5782-9d44-45d3-9bc7-f769de096303][Olban Hensard Duval]], the
tenth ruler of the Empire. Painted in 2989, it was notable for being
seven metres high - as was the graphic of a smirking [[id:0f96c6fb-16c4-4d2f-b9be-58c19db68490][feline]] face
engraved on the wall where it once hung.”

“Another disappearance, albeit of a less artistic nature, was the only
working prototype of [[id:04ba4637-336a-46c7-bab0-3ac12f16b2f9][Achilles Corporation]]’s [[id:12501602-38ed-4364-9282-81f4959ce0c3][XS1001]] security
robot. This was being guarded by several [[id:b56468c2-ce7d-4372-8336-66ebb0540cf2][XS801]] models which, according
to insiders, were found lying on their sides and emitting an unusual
‘purring’ sound.”

“There are reports of several other rare or precious artefacts
disappearing from secure locations. In all cases, there are no clues
as to how security systems were circumvented.”

“The [[id:b40c2b11-1199-4276-8f40-30cfcef498fa][Wallglass Investigations Agency]] has theorised that the Winking
Cat may not be an individual after all, but a group of criminal
specialists working together. They also suspect that these latest
thefts may be intended for some larger purpose.”
