The [[id:83b3ed4c-f0b1-4311-a4df-34bdfa742126][Sim-Archive]] of Antal Opens to Visitors
 
For the first time in the history of Utopia, the famed [[id:83b3ed4c-f0b1-4311-a4df-34bdfa742126][Sim-Archive]],
located in [[id:f14d6309-4330-49a0-8134-7f05c8a2c522][Antal]], is being opened to outside visitors.

The archive is a vast collection of memories stored as sims, allowing
others to relive the experiences of Utopian pilgrims in the form of
vivid virtual reality experiences. In the past, those sims have been
used to educate Utopians and to reform dissidents within the
community.

Today, pilots from across the galaxy can buy Utopian sims from the
more limited, public section of the [[id:83b3ed4c-f0b1-4311-a4df-34bdfa742126][Sim-Archive]]. In a brief statement,
Simguru [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] urged all-comers to travel to Antal.

"What we are offering to our brothers and sisters throughout the
galaxy is an opportunity to learn, to experience, to live through the
memories of thousands. From childlike wonder, through crushing terror,
to unrestrained joy, the sims we offer are not just a means of
entertainment, but the purest, most direct tool for achieving empathy
and consensus."
