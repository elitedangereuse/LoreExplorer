In 3278, the Corporation saw a turnaround in its decline with the
introduction of a new, faster drive system. Any similarities to the
system in the Antares incident were denied at the time, though
acknowledgements decades later revealed it was based on the results of
the same research program. In the following years further improvements
were made available both by [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] and by its rivals, each
dramatically reducing jump tomes, eventually resulted in very rapid
hyperspace travel - journeys that previously took days could now be
made in seconds - triggering a further age of expansion.

Not only did this success trigger a new period of galactic expansion,
but expansion of the Corporation itself. It has expanded into other
fields, with offices throughout human space.
