* Alliance Inspector Killed by the League of Reparation

/28 Jun 3304/

Chief Inspector [[id:9d17bf0f-6ce5-46b2-b9e6-2cab238fcce7][Kay Kilbride]] has been murdered by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation, along with four other agents of Alliance Interpol. 

The incident took place in the city of New Rossyth on Turner’s World. A spokesperson for Interpol released a brief report: 

“Chief Inspector Kilbride was acting on information that a League cell was operating from an abandoned foundry complex in New Rossyth. She led an assault team with the intention of capturing the terrorists. Preliminary forensics suggest that the entire complex was rigged with concealed explosives. Kilbride and four of her colleagues were killed instantly, with seven others injured.” 

Kilbride was one of three founding members of the tri-superpower taskforce investigating the League of Reparation. The other two, Captain [[id:cdaa5220-8f79-47dc-b160-a5d3d1ca30a0][Niamh Seutonia]] and Senior Agent [[id:fb74a286-1688-41e8-9bec-9ef14adaaf1f][Tanya Ramirez]], made a rare joint statement on behalf of the Imperial Internal Security Service and the Federal Intelligence Agency: 

“This is a sad day. We have lost one of our greatest champions in the fight against terrorism. It’s clear that the Chief Inspector was personally targeted with misinformation designed to lure her into a trap – an act of retaliation for her recent successes against the League.” 

“Although we mourn the loss of Inspector Kilbride, our work continues. Alliance Interpol has assigned Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt to assume the role of taskforce liaison. We look forward to working with her to eliminate this fanatical organisation.” 

Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.
