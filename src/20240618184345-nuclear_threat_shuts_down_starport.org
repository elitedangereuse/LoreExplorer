* Nuclear Threat Shuts Down Starport

/14 Mar 3305/

Archambault terminal in the Chun Tstar system has been overtaken by the Children of Tothos cult, who are threatening to detonate a stolen nuclear weapon. 

Senior Agent [[id:1900b0bf-bf32-4102-8cba-e9f2143ebedc][Rochelle Karim]] gave this statement: 

“Most services at Archambault terminal have shut down as a result of the control deck’s occupation by Children of Tothos adherents. It’s evident that personnel are obeying the cultists’ orders for fear that they will use the [[id:070dd4b2-b839-41a8-8f99-e8f0b1e7db9f][Lucifer Device]].” 

“Millions of people remain at the starport, making a frontal assault too risky. FIA negotiators are taking steps to open a dialogue and resolve the situation peacefully.” 

The cult’s leader, Barnabas Cole, transmitted a brief message using Archambault terminal’s communications array: 

“At last, we have found the place where our testament’s light will shine. Join us. When the ceremony is complete, you will all see Tothos as we do.”
