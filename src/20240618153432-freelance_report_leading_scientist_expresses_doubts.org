* Freelance Report: Leading Scientist Expresses Doubts

/22 Jan 3302/

Yesterday, Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] called upon independent pilots to deliver meta-alloys – produced by the newly discovered 'barnacles' in the Pleiades Nebula – to Obsidian Orbital, suggesting that the material could be the cure for the technological virus spreading through inhabited space. But Professor Violet Belbin of the Xenological Research Institute has expressed doubts: 

"I would caution against assuming that this material is the answer to our problems. The nature of these 'barnacles' is not fully understood. They could be a form of alien life, and harvesting them could have unforeseen consequences. The Xenological Research Institute is sending a team to [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] and asks that Professor Palin takes our concerns into consideration." 

Pilots have already started delivering cargo holds full of meta-alloys to Professor Palin's base of operations at Obsidian Orbital.
