* Community Goal: Halsey to Build Refugee Centre

/02 Feb 3303/

Former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has announced plans to establish a rehabilitation centre for victims of war â€“ specifically those affected by the ongoing Federal-Imperial conflict. In a statement, Halsey said: 

"The centre will of course provide victims with food and shelter, but it will also serve to reunite families and friends, and where necessary will help those affected by war relocate to new systems." 

Humanitarian groups were quick to applaud Halsey, who since being discharged from the Clearwater Clinic in July last year has repeatedly expressed her commitment to peace. 

The campaign has received financial support from the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry, which has placed an open order for Power Generators, Tantalum and Polymers for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver these commodities to Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system will be generously rewarded. 

The campaign begins on the 2nd of February 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
