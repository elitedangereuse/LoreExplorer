* A Week in Powerplay: Corrections

/14 Dec 3301/

Gabriel Vox, chairman of the GalNet Board of Review, has released a statement in response to criticism of errors in recent GalNet publications: 

"The GalNet periodical 'A Week in Powerplay' summarises weekly changes in political dynamics, economics and various other situations in thousands of systems throughout inhabited space. With this task comes a high probability of clerical error. It is my dubious honour to correct some of these errors at this time." 

"The summary of 22nd–28th October 3301 incorrectly stated that the Alliance forged no new trade agreements, when in fact an agreement with Kpaniya was finalized." 

"The summary of 3rd–9th December 3301 failed to mention the trade agreement between the Alliance and 37 Librae." 

"Princess Aisling Duval has erroneously been referred to as a 'senator' in several publications." 

"Please be assured that we will redouble our efforts to ensure the facts represented in 'A Week in Powerplay' are reliable."
