* Justice Isn’t Always Blind

/24 Apr 3301/

Just when it looked like the trail was turning cold, a new clue has
been uncovered in the investigation into the attack on the Emperor.

According to forensic accountants working on behalf of [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Princess
Lavigny-Duval]], the evidence suggests that rogue members of [[id:8c17d34d-72ce-4b62-b4a1-a9cf789fbc9d][Silver
Allied Network]] channelled funds for the attack through [[id:6039fc3b-3e2e-442d-8f35-0ee79a4125c3][Silver
Universal Plc]]. The credits were then sent to an account in the HR 706
system.

Sources close to the investigation informed GalNet that the clue was
actually uncovered several days ago, but certain groups within the
Empire had been slow in granting the Princess’s fleet unrestricted
access to the system.

Whatever the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]], Princess Lavigny-Duval has finally sent word for
her fleet to begin dismantling all crime syndicates operating in
[[id:9aad751b-a749-4fee-a990-d7da57714653][HR 706]]. It is believed that Emperor’s Grace has lodged a formal
complaint with the Senate over Senator Lavigny’s incursion into their
system, but so far the complaint has gone unanswered.

Imperial citizens interested in aiding the Princess with her
investigation are being asked to report for active duty aboard [[id:2343096d-b460-4a97-87ff-5bbd12670b4f][Laming
Orbital]].
