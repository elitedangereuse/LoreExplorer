* 0132  Lanner's Privateers
[[id:7075359f-79ca-4a24-88da-64f22e6b024a][Ackwada]]

In 2865, a request from the Rockforth Corporation reached the Emperor for assistance in the Ackwada system against the Federation. At the promise of substantial financial reward a battlegroup was assembled to respond. / Officially, the appointed leader of this flotilla, one Samuel Lanner, was an independent trader and privateer. / The clash between [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and Lanner's forces remained limited and the Federal fleet withdrew to Laveack. The Rockforth Corporation paid up as promised and signed a contract with Lanner's privateers to guarantee the defence of the system.
