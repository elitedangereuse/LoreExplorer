In 2280, the first non-human [[id:23f66b0e-9198-4dc8-a11c-fea8851e4e6d][relic]] was found in space. The object was
found buried on [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]]; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is
still surrounded in [[id:6ad7e1e4-4fb0-4cbf-b9a1-771afa67ed0b][secrecy]], even in 3300. No information has ever
been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other
than it is non-human.
