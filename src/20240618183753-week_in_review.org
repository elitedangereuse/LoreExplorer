* Week in Review

/10 Jun 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

A descendant of Amaro Hem, one of the INRA’s senior members, has been murdered by terrorist group the League of Reparation. The murder recreated the circumstances of Commander John Jameson’s death, and has been interpreted as an act of poetic justice by the League of Reparation. Senior Agent [[id:fb74a286-1688-41e8-9bec-9ef14adaaf1f][Tanya Ramirez]] said that the League was using theatrical tactics to ensure its message reached the media. 

In other news, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] met with not one but two of her suitors over the weekend – Federal Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] and Senator [[id:1d3d8a69-609b-4e83-b1a1-a46cb23ba195][Caspian Leopold]]. The former was invited to a function at the princess’s palace on [[id:465800ad-1e27-44fa-9b4b-5ca23bcc36ce][Emeral]]d, while the latter made an unofficial visit the following day. 

Meanwhile, the [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] Radio Network has announced plans to broadcast its annual conference from the [[id:4aedfccd-a366-4b25-a5e2-538bb29a35cb][Diso]] system. To ensure they can share the event with the entire galaxy, the Network has placed an open order for various commodities. But the Lave Jet Family has responded with a rival campaign designed to undermine the Lave Radio initiative, inviting pilots to liberate commodities from those supporting the Lave Radio campaign. 

Two initiatives to restore starports damaged by the Thargoids have reached successful conclusions. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaigns by delivering construction materials to Dantec Enterprise in the [[id:092e7139-1d8c-45d1-89ce-615326e10853][Socho]] system and to The Oracle in the Pleiades. 

Finally, a valuable work of art has been stolen by a mysterious and highly skilled criminal. A spray-painted graphic of what looked like a winking cat was discovered at the scene of the crime, which took place in the Garden City Gallery on Turner’s World in the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system. Garden City security forces are investigating, but as yet have no leads.  

And those are the main stories this week.
