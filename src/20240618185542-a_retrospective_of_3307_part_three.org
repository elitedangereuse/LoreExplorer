* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part Three)

/02 Jan 3308/

Sima Kalhana reviews the most newsworthy events of the past year in this series of articles. 

“July began badly for the Federation, with more factions seceding in response to the Proactive Detection Bureau’s establishment. The newly independent nations severed all links with these new surveillance efforts, inspiring many other systems to do likewise. This secession crisis would rumble on for the rest of the year.” 

“The Blue Viper Club, one of the rarely seen dredger clans, joined forces with the Kumo Crew to manufacture a medicinal drug that turned out to be a new strain of onionhead. The drug would ultimately end up being legally distributed by Neomedical Industries, causing [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] to seek revenge against the corporation.” 

“Tensions soared in the Marlinist Colonies during an election for the head of their diplomatic consulate. Aaron Whyte’s candidate had the support of an Imperial senator, which would have given the Neo-Marlinists a powerful voice within the Empire.” 

“When a more moderate candidate was elected, the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] reacted by bombing both Marlinist starports, murdering tens of thousands including First Minister Jenna Fairfax. It seemed Theta Seven’s extremist views allowed anyone to be targeted as an enemy, even his fellow Marlinists. The civil war concluded in August, with Whyte killed in battle as his supporters were overcome in direct combat.” 

“Following accusations of incompetence regarding the vanished Alexandria megaship, Aegis was officially suspended and subjected to a board of inquiry. This would have ramifications for the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids, and encourage [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] to position himself as an alternative.” 

“In the corporate sphere, [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] created a new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that would eventually become an autonomous company. There were rumours that the Torval and Mastopolos families were now at loggerheads after decades of working in unison.” 

“In September, the mystery of Hyford’s Cache was finally unlocked. The trail led to revelations of dark experiments which are believed to have involved human test subjects and Thargoid technology.” 

“When the Thargoids themselves appeared en masse in the Cornsar system, [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] was ready for them. An anti-xeno superweapon of undisclosed nature was deployed, wiping out some of the aliens and driving away the rest. It seemed that the self-titled ‘man of science’ had developed something revolutionary, inspiring many to place their faith in him to end the Thargoid menace once and for all.”
