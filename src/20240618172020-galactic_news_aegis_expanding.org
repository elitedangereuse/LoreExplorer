* Galactic News: Aegis Expanding

/21 Oct 3303/

Following news that the Empire and Federation have withdrawn from the Pleiades Nebula, contractors in the core systems have reported that Aegis is poised to establish a number of outposts in the region. 

The reports indicate that Aegis intends to establish more than twenty orbital outposts in the coming months, to support its ongoing research and defence initiative. Two of these outposts have already been built, and construction of a third is expected to begin soon. 

Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], Aegis’s chief military liaison, commented briefly on the news: 

“In my view it is imperative that Aegis has a consolidated presence in the Pleiades, close to the centre of Thargoid activity. Fortunately our backers in the Alliance, Empire and Federation agree with me.”
