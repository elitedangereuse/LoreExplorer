Sirius Navy is a large organisation, providing vigorous protection for
all [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] interests. It owns its own cruisers built by
Imperial [[id:aa5d0177-2807-4e3d-b0d0-1a40b3203598][Gutamaya]] yards, and built under license in [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]]' own naval
yards, branded in the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]'s own royal blue livery, but
much of their naval force comes from a large number of [[id:ab621e71-06dd-443a-a038-6e84e1c9e04e][Cutters]] built
under license and by Imperial Gutamaya, operating as patrol ships, and
a great many fighters.
