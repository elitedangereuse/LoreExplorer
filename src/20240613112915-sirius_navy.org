Sirius Navy is a large organisation, providing vigorous protection for
all Sirius Corporation interests. It owns its own cruisers built by
Imerpial Gutamaya yards, and built under license in Sirius' own naval
yards, branded in the Sirius Corporation's own royal blue livery, but
much of their naval force comes from a large number of Cutters built
under license and by Imperial Gutamaya, operating as patrol ships, and
a great many fighters.
