* Galactic News: [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] to Undergo Psychiatric Review

/07 May 3302/

A member of Jasmina Halsey's personal staff has announced that the former president's appeal for exploration data failed to uncover any evidence of the entities she claims to have seen. The campaign yielded a huge quantity of exploration data, but despite being subjected to extensive examination, the information did not yield any proof of Halsey's assertions. 

The spokesperson went on to say that the former Federal president had been admitted to a secure psychiatric facility on Mars for "extended care and review". This announcement follows weeks of speculation concerning Halsey's mental health, which was called into question by commentators both within and outside the Federation. 

Halsey's spokesperson declined to answer journalists' questions.
