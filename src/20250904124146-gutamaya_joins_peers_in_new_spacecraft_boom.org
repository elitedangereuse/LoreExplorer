* Gutamaya Joins Peers in New Spacecraft Boom

/01 Apr 3311/

Imperial socialites were treated to a tour of [[id:aa5d0177-2807-4e3d-b0d0-1a40b3203598][Gutamaya]]’s newest ship,
the [[id:e7e28c28-b97c-4106-9b04-8932279e267f][Imperial Corsair]], at an extravagant launch on [[id:912f1172-e2b9-4fe9-9e53-13dd44fac4c4][Capitol]] in [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]].

Gutamaya's event was attended by over a thousand prominent engineers,
senators, press members and other notable individuals. Princess
[[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] and her cousin, [[id:3198b73e-a63a-4edd-aadd-d6cdbf197115][Lucretia Roche-Duval]], were the guests of
honour.

Positive reviews of the Imperial Corsair’s public unveiling have been
published in several outlets across the Empire already.

"The Corsair’s specifications showed a promising mix of straight-line
speed and large cargo capacity, making it ideal for traders who value
efficient travel times,” said [[id:ca3f2497-4c01-42c8-9535-b6f5628443d0][Eugine Varrik]] of the [[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][Imperial
Herald]]. “The sleek design employs Gutamaya’s famous curves – attendees
were queueing up with their blinks to take the perfect selfie.”

“What impressed me was the flexibility of the Corsair’s internal
components,” said [[id:ebcf3345-ea0c-4d36-941b-24e8786acab6][Miyu Azusa]] for [[id:9e04a792-7d27-4492-b430-8bd8673d7454][Eye on Achenar]]. “With the right
modules this vessel could adapt well to any pilot profession. All
while enjoying a classic Imperial aesthetic, of course!”

The Imperial Corsair is a medium-sized vessel, notable for being the
first multipurpose Gutamaya ship which will be commercially available
to pilots outside of the [[id:e9becd28-9644-42aa-afc8-7bba3ce10076][Imperial Navy]]. It is expected to be available
for purchase from shipyards next week.
