* Alien 'Barnacles' Discovered in the Pleiades

/15 Jan 3302/

[[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has released a statement in response to the discovery of non-human structures in the Pleiades Nebula: 

"This is a momentous day â€“ alien structures have been confirmed on at least two planets in the Pleiades Nebula! I must congratulate Commander Octo, who made the initial discovery on [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] 5c, and thank Commander Snax, who contacted me. Within minutes, Canonn scientists and other commanders were at the site." 

"We now know of multiple barnacles on [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] 5c, and the corrupted message recently received in [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] has led us to many more on Pleiades Sector JC-U B3-2." 

"I can confirm that these structures produce meta-alloys, emit a sound similar to that made by the Unknown Artefacts, and bear mysterious markings that we have yet to identify. Some commanders have reported malfunctions near the structures, which might explain the crashed ships found near many of the barnacles." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
