* [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] Announces Marriage to Federal Ambassador

/23 Jun 3304/

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] has made an unexpected announcement regarding her relationship with Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester.  

At a press conference in her palace on Emerald, the princess looked radiant as she addressed the media: 

“It’s no secret that Jordan and I grew close during his official visit. The time has come to let you know that we are to be husband and wife.” 

“I’m aware that some will see this as unorthodox, even controversial, but love knows no borders. It’s our wish that our marriage will build lasting bridges between the Empire and the Federation.” 

A statement from Ambassador Rochester appeared in a special edition of The Federal Times: 

“Representing the Federation has been my life’s work, but meeting Her Highness – Aisling – made me realise that being by her side means even more. We hope that our betrothal will usher in a new era of cooperation between the two superpowers.” 

Among the media reactions was this from entertainment journalist Solomon Helios: 

“I’ve been reporting on Princess Duval’s romantic life for a while now, and even I didn’t see this coming. Can Aisling really pull this off? Could a Federation gentleman actually marry into the Imperial family? Will Emperor Lavigny-Duval and President Hudson share a dance at the wedding, or will they step in to prevent this union from taking place? The galaxy might never be the same again!” 

As yet there has been no official comment from the Imperial Palace or the White House.
