* Aisling Duval Announces Marriage to Federal Ambassador

/23 Jun 3304/

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] has made an unexpected announcement regarding her relationship with Federal Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]].  

At a press conference in her palace on Emerald, the princess looked
radiant as she addressed the media:

“It’s no secret that Jordan and I grew close during his official
visit. The time has come to let you know that we are to be husband and
wife.”

“I’m aware that some will see this as unorthodox, even controversial,
but love knows no borders. It’s our wish that our marriage will build
lasting bridges between [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] and the Federation.”

A statement from Ambassador Rochester appeared in a special edition of
The Federal Times:

“Representing [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] has been my life’s work, but meeting Her
Highness – Aisling – made me realise that being by her side means even
more. We hope that our betrothal will usher in a new era of
cooperation between the two superpowers.”

Among the media reactions was this from entertainment journalist
[[id:761f7c54-51ea-4248-80c1-3c00cb010a27][Solomon Helios]]:

“I’ve been reporting on Princess Duval’s romantic life for a while
now, and even I didn’t see this coming. Can Aisling really pull this
off? Could a Federation gentleman actually marry into the Imperial
family? Will Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Lavigny-Duval]] and President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Hudson]] share a dance
at the wedding, or will they step in to prevent this union from taking
place? The galaxy might never be the same again!”

As yet there has been no official comment from the [[id:7210d36a-25f5-4c8e-8cf2-069de549d438][Imperial Palace]] or
the [[id:08d6421e-9b07-4a01-8df1-44f9dd51de59][White House]].
