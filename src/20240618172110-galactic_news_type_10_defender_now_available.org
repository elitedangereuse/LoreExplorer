* Galactic News: Type-10 Defender Now Available

/22 Dec 3303/

Lakon Spaceways has announced that its new ship, the Type-10 Defender, is now available to the public. 

The vessel boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9 Heavy on which it is based, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout. 

The Type-10 has been developed primarily in response to the recent [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] attacks in the Pleiades, and Lakon has said it envisages the ship “being particularly effective in combat situations”.
