The Achenar system is notable as the home of the Empire, one of the
galaxy's three superpowers. Capitol, a satellite of the sixth body in
the system, is the primary residence of the emperor, and the seat of
Imperial power. The system is characterised by widespread opulence and
ostentation. The permit for this system can be obtained from the
Imperial military.
