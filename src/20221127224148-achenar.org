* 0128 [[https://eddb.io/attraction/72927][Origins of the Empire]]
The origins of the [[id:2891de55-e2d4-429c-b761-095a74482a02][Empire]] date back to the colonisation of the Achenar
system in the middle of the 23rd century. [[id:7be9a849-7a8d-40f9-837d-b1ab30538bb0][Marlin Duval]] was a wealthy
woman from [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]], who, disenchanted with their administration and
authorities, set off with her own colonising fleet to [[id:6348d885-bf86-44b6-a189-3d849e34eb40][Achenar 6d]]
because it was so far from Earth. Her leadership ended abruptly when
her brother [[id:a8a8c926-5bfc-4411-928b-7f88d2209e41][Henson]] oversaw a flying 'accident' in which she
perished. The democratic government changed abruptly to one of strict
Imperial rule and from then on the family assumed leadership. [[id:872d74c9-9cce-49ad-8f91-be76bbd3e2cb][Female]]
children in the family were prevented with [[id:45285b61-0955-4b0e-86d1-dcce9b03b6d3][genetic techniques]], such
was the hatred of Marlin Duval's principles and vision of a world in
peace. This restriction was gradually phased out over the years, but
the succession of [[id:1aad604c-fb0f-484b-b3dc-a63fe14597b5][Emperors]] has remained along the male line until
recently.
