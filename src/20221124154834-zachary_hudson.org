  "The truth is that you cannot escape adversity. You have to stand up
  and face it. That's how you get stronger. That's how you learn. Maybe
  you miss a meal or two. Maybe your kids have dirty faces and shabby
  clothes. If that's what it takes to get you out looking for work, then
  so be it. I'm not going to insult you by pitying you, because I know
  you can do better. And you know it, too."

  "I'm not a monster, despite what the Liberals think. I believe in
  government aid. But I believe it should be reserved for times of
  genuine crisis, and being poor is not a crisis!"

  "People can do remarkable things when they're properly motivated, and
  that motivation is something no amount of government money can
  provide. Without it, we'd still be on Earth, jostling for whatever
  scraps of living space the state gave us."

  "I have a framed quotation on my wall. It's something my father used
  to say to me. When I got older, I found out it was by a man called
  Nieremberg who lived a couple of thousand years ago. It says, 'Certain
  divine rays break out of the soul in adversity, like sparks from the
  afflicted flint.' Now you just think about that. Take all the time you
  need."

[[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] is the President of the Federation, having won a vote of
no confidence against the previous incumbent, [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]], in
June 3301. Politically, Hudson is a Republican and a 'hawk', unafraid to
explore military solutions to problems.

Hudson's parents were itinerant traders who made their home on their
hauling vessel. From a young age, Hudson was burdened with
responsibility. He would often be left in harge of his five younger
siblings while his parents were off plying their trade, and has spoken
on the long hours he would spend watching the cargo "with nothing but a
rifle for company" in case raiders tried to steal it.

The young Hudson greatly admired the military, and when he was old
enough to be trading himself he made a point of offering pilots a
discount on food and beer. Given the standard of food-cartridge rations
in most barracks, and the low pay soldiers received, this effort was
welcomed.

When times were especially hard and there was no money to invest in
stock, the Hudson family would land on Earth-like planets and hunt for
game, which they would dress and sell themselves. Hudson has emphasised
that this was perfectly legal -- no matter how hungry they were, they
never resorted to poaching. The president remains a keen hunter, and
enjoys taking diplomatic guests on hunting trips, cooking them dinner
himself. Hudson reportedly takes particular pride in his steaks.

Hudson's entrance into politics was marked by a growing sense that the
Federal government and its heavy taxes were making it harder for traders
to earn a living, while rewarding those who did not want to work. When
bureaucratic red tape prevented the family from docking for twenty-four
hours, resulting in the loss of an entire cargo of perishable goods,
Hudson decided to do something about it.

Hudson has never served in the military, but he is generally regarded as
'one of us' by the Federation naval command. His old friend, Lucas
Vincent, is now Admiral of the Fleet, and the two enjoyed a close
professional relationship. Hudson has given the military considerable
support, investing in improved training facilities, cutting taxes for
shipyards and cultivating public respect for the armed forces.
