Is [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] Next in Line? 
 
With the wedding of her mother and the Emperor due to take in place in just over a week’s time, it now looks certain that [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] will become heir apparent to the throne. When asked about this during the Imperial Herald political special show about the upcoming wedding, she said: 

“Like all Imperial citizens I am overjoyed at the Emperor’s  recovery from his coma. As a close member of the family, I was of course kept in the loop concerning his condition and we all expected that he would make a full recovery.” 

In a breach of etiquette for what was supposed to be a light-hearted programme, the reporter pressed for a more direct answer. With regal dignity [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] replied: 

“We are only days from the Emperor returning to the public stage. Trying to debate about what might occur if he were to die in these intervening days is both rude and disrespectful of our Emperor. I look forward to many years in service of Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] in whatever capacity he deems appropriate.” 

The live online audience booed the commentator and applauded her response.
