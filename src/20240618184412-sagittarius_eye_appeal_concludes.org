* Sagittarius Eye Appeal Concludes

/13 Jun 3305/

A request for construction materials made by Sagittarius Eye has ended. 

The appeal has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in an influx of deliveries to McMullen Ring, the organisation’s base of operations. As a result, a new asteroid base named The Print Works has been established in the Millese system. 

As the campaign drew to a close, the organisation’s spokesperson issued the following statement:  

"Thanks to all you delightful pilots, we now have a lovely new print works in Millese to produce the galaxy's finest magazine. We’re absolutely thrilled, and everyone who helped is welcome to visit us in our new home." 

Contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from McMullen Ring in the Millese system.
