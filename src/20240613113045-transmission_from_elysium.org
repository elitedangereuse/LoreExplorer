"We made it and it is as beautiful here as one might imagine. It is so
serene, so peaceful. Yet not everyone made it.

Some time ago, I met a woman named [[id:fd714225-17da-4571-9c25-739be337069a][Margaret]]. She and her husband
traveled the stars. They weren't necessarily prolific explorers,
rather they would travel to [[id:1f37cad9-f017-4253-ae21-915fee1285a2][war]] torn systems where she, as a nurse,
would treat the wounded and comfort the dying. On one of their
expeditions, her husband died and she was left alone with the ship
they once roamed the stars in. It was after this time that I met
her. She would leave the station pad so slow, I would often tease her
by declaring she was the notorious loiterer Margaret Mason, flaunting
the law at every station but never caught.

As I said, she wasn't a famous explorer but for some reason when this
chance to go to Elysium came up, she wanted to join. She isn't on any
of the official rosters as she came along without signing up. There
were more than a few of those.

Being a bit of an engineer, I helped prepare her ship for the
journey. I have some influence with [[id:d512672e-8849-46f9-b39d-a53f0c5765bf][Farseer]] at [[id:4af71116-980a-4119-b93e-a0b368cf9550][Deciat]], so getting her
FSD adjusted for the jump at point decision was fairly easy. We
replaced some of the ship construction with lighter materials and
removed what wasn't necessary. Her ship, [[id:115312bc-07bf-4a4a-a5b5-e5232eb691e0][Stellar Pearl]], was ready.

The day of the jump came and we all left [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] heading to [[id:29f2156a-1572-4077-9274-968142701ece][Hades]]. I like
the old songs, so I had a song called 'I see fire' on the PA while
landing. It seemed apropos. It occurs to me that using a place called
Hades as a rally point to reach a place called Elysium is ironic. Once
everyone arrived, we left the star kissed surface to begin the climb
to point decision. There things did not go as smoothly.

It was discovered that some specialized software we had all installed
for fuel calculations had a bug, but not until the group had started
the jump across un-scoopable stars. In addition, fuel use is not
linear for some ship configurations, such as my own. Luckily I
discovered this fact and was able to compensate.

During the jumps from point decision to Elysium the common radio
channel was filled with chatter, some panicked, some calm. Finally, we
made it across the gap.

Most of us did anyway. A headcount had showed a few missing. Among the
missing was the Stellar Pearl. The last I saw of her ship was at the
second star coming across the gap, where most of the confusion had
started. Her ship [[id:6ccd4f78-28b4-4206-8194-647814a8ce69][disappeared]] from the scope leaving a jump wake but
apparently never arrived at the other side.

Over the expedition period, I scanned and cataloged my assigned
systems always keeping an eye out for my friend or any of the others
who didn't come across. They never appeared.

At the time of this recording, there is no known way to get back from
this cluster. I send this out in hopes someone on the other side
receives it and knows of our fate and remembers those lost."
