* Marlinist Refugee Crisis Grows Critical

/08 Dec 3306/

Hundreds of thousands of political refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation have brought both superpowers to the brink of conflict. 

The Marlinists, who believe in restructuring the Empire into a republic, escaped crackdowns in several Imperial systems during a hunt for Neo-Marlinist terrorists. 

The Federation has provided temporary safe haven for the refugees. However, security concerns proved to be justified when the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] bombed a Federal starport where captured members were being held. 

The Federal Security Service provided this update: 

“The Marlinists themselves have informed us of more individuals among them with [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] connections. The risk of terrorism from this population is now low, although it’s impossible to know exactly how many have been radicalised.” 

There have been heated debates in Congress over granting citizenship to the Marlinists. President Hudson insisted that “all illegal aliens must be deported”, and has strengthened the Federal Navy as a defensive measure in light of the Empire’s warnings.  

Conversely, Shadow President Winters argued that “turning away starving refugees to face imprisonment and discrimination would be immoral”. She also noted that the same principles of democratic representation found in Marlinism are enshrined in the Federal Accord. 

This disagreement between the Republican and Liberal Parties has led to stalemate, with the fate of the Marlinists hanging in the balance.
