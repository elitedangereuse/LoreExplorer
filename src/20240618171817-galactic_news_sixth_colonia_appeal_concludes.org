* Galactic News: Sixth [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Appeal Concludes

/02 Jun 3303/

The sixth [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Council migration appeal has come to an end. Hundreds of organisations took part in the campaign, delivering huge quantities of material to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the hope of earning a place in the Colonia Nebula. 

The Council is now processing the deliveries to confirm exactly how much has been received. Once the process is complete, the Council will contact the organisations that made the largest contribution, and start work on their new outposts.
