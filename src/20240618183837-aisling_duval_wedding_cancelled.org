* Aisling Duval Wedding Cancelled

/23 Aug 3304/

Federal news channels have announced that the wedding of Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] and Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] has been cancelled. 

The statement came from Congress member [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]]:  

“The planned wedding between my son Jordan Rochester and Her Imperial
Highness will no longer take place. We have contacted everyone
involved with the event and closed down all related projects.”

The announcement follows [[id:11c82a20-33a7-444f-977c-0ea2f666c25b][anti-slavery]] campaigner [[id:5fdbd5d4-1f5f-4984-8876-4bee1d590dd7][Jarl Toredo]]’s
confession that he and [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] were romantically involved for
several months. Toredo also claimed that the planned marriage was
purely a political matter.

The cancellation was confirmed by the Imperial Palace on Emerald, but
there has been no direct response from Princess Duval or Ambassador
Rochester.

Political journalist [[id:745efc38-c548-40c0-81d2-82973c604d37][Cassia Carvalho]] of The [[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][Imperial Herald]] commented:

“The fact that this news comes from Isolde Rochester gives weight to
Jarl Toredo’s claims. If the marriage was a political scheme, that may
explain why the Rochester family matriarch is the one to call it off,
no longer trusting Princess Duval to play her part. Or perhaps this is
simply the reaction of a mother, enraged at her future
daughter-in-law’s infidelity.”

“Had the marriage taken place, would it have initiated an era of
Federal-Imperial cooperation, or triggered a new wave of conflict? It
seems we will never know.”
