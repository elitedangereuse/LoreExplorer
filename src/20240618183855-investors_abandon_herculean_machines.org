* Investors Abandon [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]

/14 Sep 3304/

An anonymous source has revealed that [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], owner of technology
company [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]], was previously investigated by the [[id:0ba9accc-93ad-45a0-a771-e26daa59e58f][Federal
Security Service]].

The source shared recently declassified FSS records on the [[id:d06803e0-267c-4ffc-88f2-967058fce82e][Rewired]]
news channel, and stated:

“When establishing Herculean five years ago, [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]] accepted
financial contributions from individuals connected to organised-[[id:d686af2f-d947-4f3b-ba19-d57c93d29d99][crime]]
networks, such as the [[id:792ffce8-85dc-4147-8ea3-8e5feb26ba94][Red Family]]. While Hurd did not technically break
the law, the FSS has kept a close eye on him ever since.”

In the wake of this news, a number of [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]]’ corporate
investors withdrew their support. [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]] told the media:

“This is a smear campaign, and those underhanded snakes at [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]] are behind it!” 

[[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]], CEO of rival company [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], declined to comment,
but [[id:81ba02cb-f405-4079-9207-63afc71263df][Harlow Nassry]], technology journalist at [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]],
observed:

“With [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] losing investment and [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]]’s facility
destroyed, both companies are in a compromised position. Unless they
can drum up additional support, neither will be able to unveil their
new designs at the [[id:9d064da0-7be3-4c7b-99ad-0edd1585d4ca][Rackham Ultratech Expo]] in October.”
