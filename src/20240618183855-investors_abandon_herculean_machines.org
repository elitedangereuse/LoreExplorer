* Investors Abandon Herculean Machines

/14 Sep 3304/

An anonymous source has revealed that Maddox Hurd, owner of technology company Herculean Machines, was previously investigated by the Federal Security Service. 

The source shared recently declassified FSS records on the Rewired news channel, and stated: 

“When establishing Herculean five years ago, Maddox Hurd accepted financial contributions from individuals connected to organised-crime networks, such as the Red Family. While Hurd did not technically break the law, the FSS has kept a close eye on him ever since.” 

In the wake of this news, a number of Herculean Machines’ corporate investors withdrew their support. Maddox Hurd told the media: 

“This is a smear campaign, and those underhanded snakes at Supratech are behind it!” 

Scorpio DeVorrow, CEO of rival company Supratech, declined to comment, but Harlow Nassry, technology journalist at The Federal Times, observed: 

“With Herculean Machines losing investment and Supratech’s facility destroyed, both companies are in a compromised position. Unless they can drum up additional support, neither will be able to unveil their new designs at the Rackham Ultratech Expo in October.”
