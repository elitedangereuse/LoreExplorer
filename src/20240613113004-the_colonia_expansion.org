* 0666 The Colonia Expansion
[[id:2490f4fa-a930-4e1a-9695-ebd5d4fe8f51][Colonia]]

Ever since [[id:935880a2-d4fb-4d27-ad48-0f95112ee0fe][Jaques Station]] arrived in [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] in June 3302,
thousands of galactic citizens have migrated to the system in search
of a new way of life. The migration movement has resulted in a number
of new outposts in the region, as well as a chain of stations
connecting the burgeoning community with the core systems.

With the colony now firmly established in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 -
recently renamed Colonia - the system's governing body, the Colonia
Council, has announced plans to colonize the surrounding
systems.
