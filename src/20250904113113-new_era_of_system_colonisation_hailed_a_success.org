* New Era of System Colonisation Hailed a Success

/13 Mar 3311/

The first wave of newly colonised star systems has been labelled a
‘remarkable success’ by observers from across the core systems.

[[id:81ba02cb-f405-4079-9207-63afc71263df][Harlow Nassry]] of the [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][Federal Times]] wrote that “the raw potential of
these new ports and settlements has inspired migration, with a notable
number of displaced refugees from [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] boarding [[id:c5877314-9b70-4da4-8bb0-7959b3e52706][colony ships]] to start
fresh.”

[[id:08031d1a-7eb6-4bb8-8be0-e61a5c11db82][Colm Tornquist]] of the [[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][Imperial Herald]] noted the “considerable
opportunity offered by [[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]]’s support system for
independent system colonisation,” remarking that “these fledgling
populations are potential candidates to accept the Empire’s
benevolence.”

Meanwhile, [[id:76d00760-e607-4a24-aec5-a630460b3f31][Irfan Karim]] of the [[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][Alliance Tribune]] suggested the
“commercial enterprise offered by these [[id:2547515c-389e-450d-893c-435b62436fc4][system architects]] is truly
impressive. One wonders just how far this new frontier will expand,
given the industrial potency of these trailblazing communities.”

[[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]] has released the official figures on the initial
colonisation rush:

26,684 Claims have been made

13,165 Systems have been colonised

24,037 New starports and outposts have been built

14,216 Surface installations have been established

983,599,593 Units of cargo have been delivered to construction sites
