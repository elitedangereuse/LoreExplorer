* Duvals Gather to Celebrate New Year

/01 Jan 3308/

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] marked the start of 3308 by introducing her cousin [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]], his wife and their newborn son to Imperial high society. 

Entertainment journalist [[id:761f7c54-51ea-4248-80c1-3c00cb010a27][Solomon Helios]] broadcast a report on the event: 

“It’s an annual tradition for Princess Aisling to invite the great and the good to her palace on [[id:465800ad-1e27-44fa-9b4b-5ca23bcc36ce][Emeral]]d, although the tragic loss of her father in 3306 meant that last year’s gathering was cancelled. This year she made up for it with a sumptuous, glittering celebration of the kind that we Imperials are famed for.” 

“For the first time, [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] and Lady [[id:ef9ddb06-8cb2-4c3f-a688-469be3149aa9][Astrid Minerva-Duval]] were in attendance. This youthful couple were surprisingly charming for a pair who would once have been arrested on sight. They entertained guests with stories of trading and fighting aboard tiny ships, from the days when their only title was Commander.” 

“However, the real guest of honour spent most of his time asleep, oblivious to the colossal attention he drew. Yes, baby Hector made his very first public appearance, having been born while his parents were under senatorial protection. Many dignitaries insisted on having their image recorded beside the ‘future Emperor’, a phrase one could hear being murmured throughout the palace.” 

“But what of the current Emperor? Unlike Hadrian’s family, [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] remains in seclusion and only communicates remotely with the Senate. Now that the terrorists have been quelled, surely the time has come for Her Imperial Majesty to reappear before her loyal subjects?”
