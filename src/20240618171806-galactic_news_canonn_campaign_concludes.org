* Galactic News: Canonn Campaign Concludes

/19 May 3303/

A spokesperson for the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has announced that its appeal for indium, computer components and tea has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Zoline Port. The campaign also received the support of hundreds of combat pilots, who protected traders contributing commodities to the campaign. Construction of the deep-space research vessel Gnosis is now underway. 

The organisationâ€™s leaders have extended their gratitude to those who supported the campaign.  

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Zoline Port in the LTT 377 system.
