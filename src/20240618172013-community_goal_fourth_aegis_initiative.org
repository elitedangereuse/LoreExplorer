* Community Goal: Fourth Aegis Initiative

/13 Oct 3303/

Aegis's campaign to counter the rising [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] threat has entered its fourth phase. Once again, the tri-superpower organisation has secured financial support from a corporate partner, which has placed an open order for various commodities. 

As the campaign began, The Federal Times spoke to Elvira Martuuk, one of many independent engineers contracted by Aegis, who is overseeing this stage of the campaign. Martuuk said: 

"The Thargoids' ability to disable our ships is one of their most formidable weapons. For the past few weeks I've been working on a device that I hope will protect human vessels from the Thargoids' immobilising field." 

The Khun Independent Governance has promised to reward pilots who deliver [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Cyclops Tissue Samples, Coltan and Beryllium to Cremona Prospect in the Khun system. 

The campaign begins on the 12th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
