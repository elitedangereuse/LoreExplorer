* Galactic News: People’s Rakapila Progressive Party Campaign Concludes

/07 Jul 3303/

A spokesperson for the People’s Rakapila Progressive Party has announced that its appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering domestic appliances, consumer technology and clothing to Stone Enterprise in Rakapila, and by eliminating agitators in the system so traders could deliver commodities in safety. 

The organisation has thanked those who supported the campaign. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system.
