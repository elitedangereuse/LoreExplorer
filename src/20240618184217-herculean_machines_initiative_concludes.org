* [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]] Initiative Concludes

/03 Jan 3305/

An initiative run by [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]], manufacturer of Duradrive personal computers, has now concluded. 

Multiple shipments of consumer technology, hardware diagnostic sensors and computer components were delivered to the Blatrimpe system, which will be used to fulfil a large order from the Federal Navy. 

[[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], the company’s CEO, made this statement: 

“Once again, I offer my thanks to the galactic community for its support. We’re very pleased to become a supplier to the Federal Navy, and we hope that the Duradrive remains in production for a long, long time.” 

Pilots who took part in the initiative can now collect their rewards from Boltzmann Hub in the Blatrimpe system.
