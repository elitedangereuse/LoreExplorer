* Federal Election: The Imperial Perspective

/12 Oct 3309/

As the Federation readies itself for a new president, the Empire is preparing for potential changes to its relationship with its historical rival. 

Last year Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] severed all official collaboration with the other superpowers, except for limited contributions to Aegis. But this does not mean the Empire is ignoring the potential impact of either Jerome Archer or [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] becoming the next Federal president. 

Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] remarked on the election during a military parade through the city of Port Isabelle: 

“The Federation’s leaders always reinforce their popularity by framing the Empire as the ‘great enemy’. I expect Archer will have those same aggressive tendencies. In [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]], I’d prefer to deal with that predictable approach, since Winters is clearly the more cunning and deceitful candidate.” 

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] was asked her opinion while visiting a xenology seminar hosted by the Achenar Research Council: 

“I must admit that Felicia Winters’s style of governance is more appealing, though she should be mindful of her running mate’s influence. But whoever becomes president must break the cycle of hostility between Empire and Federation. My fruitful collaboration with other Aegis delegates, and ACT’s success against the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, is evidence of how effective inter-superpower cooperation can be.” 

The election was also discussed by Cassia Carvalho, political journalist for The Imperial Herald: 

“The average Imperial citizen has little interest in the Federation’s internal workings, but anxiety in the Senate is high. With the Thargoid war still raging, the prospect of a new president seeking to stamp their authority on the interstellar stage is a major concern. Conversely, some captains of industry anticipate a new era of trade with a friendlier Federation, if the Emperor can be convinced to rescind her isolationist decree.” 

Voting within Federal systems has been running for 24 hours, and polling suggests [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] holds a slight lead over Jerome Archer. The election will run for another three days.
