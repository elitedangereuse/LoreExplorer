* Search for Lottery Winner

/14 Jul 3304/

An appeal has been launched to find the owner of a lottery ticket worth one billion credits. 

The Federal Grand Lottery is the largest of its kind, regularly handing out millions of credits. The Grand Lottery also funds a wide range of social and infrastructure projects in Federation systems. 

The annual Galactic Jackpot is by far the most popular lottery game, but on this occasion the winner has yet to make a claim. Purchase of the winning ticket has been confirmed, but no data is available as to who bought the ticket or when. 

[[id:c56b0f38-65be-4423-b9fe-9c1a19d4dcc1][Tori Theopolis]], a spokesperson for the Federal Grand Lottery, told the media: 

“Someone out there is rich beyond his or her wildest dreams – they just don’t know it yet. We’re keen to find this lucky individual so we can hand over their winnings. We ask all citizens to check with any lottery players they know. Your soon-to-be-billionaire friend or relative might be very grateful for your help!”
