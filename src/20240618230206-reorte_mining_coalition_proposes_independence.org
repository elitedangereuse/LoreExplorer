* Reorte Mining Coalition Proposes Independence

/14 Mar 3308/

The Reorte Mining Coalition wants to cut ties with the Alliance in protest against the military defence pact with Sirius Corporation. 

Vox Galactica featured an announcement from the faction’s CEO, Fergus Cassidy: 

“The pact’s three-month probationary period is clearly a ruse. It is designed to allow time for Sirius agents to bribe, convince or threaten Allied decision-makers into accepting [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]]’s presence. We’d rather become an independent faction than allow this greedy and untrustworthy company into Reorte space.” 

Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents Reorte, told the Assembly: 

“Obviously I have argued against this extreme move, but I cannot ignore the strength of feeling from the system’s governing faction. For Reorte Mining Coalition leaders, leaving the Alliance is less risky than allowing Sirius Corporation to become embedded in the system’s infrastructure.” 

Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported: 

“There are already wild rumours that this situation might spark mass declarations of independence, similar to the Federation’s secession crisis last year. But there is no indication as yet that these events will play out quite so dramatically.” 

“What is certain, however, is how damaging this is for Prime Minister Mahon’s campaign to promote acceptance of Sirius Corporation. A historically significant system such as Reorte withdrawing from the Alliance would likely sour the megacorp’s reputation with those it seeks to impress.”
