* 0149 Military Base Established
[[id:73e31493-0c88-4fd7-9f49-9f3f1c92db41][Facece]]

In 3104 a permanent military training base was established on [[id:f91fddfb-172c-481f-83fa-6f9c2bcc9264][Peter's Wreck]] in the Facece system. Facece had always been known for its
strong support and commitment to training the Empire's finest, but the
dedicated base signalled a new fervour for military renewal. This
renewal was tested when in 3114, the scientists of [[id:fdf67e2f-4b6c-40ff-b1f8-9ccc8638b82f][Nesbitt Landing]] in
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] began demonstrating substantial innovations in robotic
manufacture and production.
