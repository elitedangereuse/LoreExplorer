Aliens Kidnapped the President
 
The spectre of [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][President Halsey]]’s disappearance in [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]]
refuses to die down. Despite the findings of the official report some
claim that the matter is far from closed. One such person is
self-proclaimed conspiracy expert [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]] on his
investigative show ‘The Hidden World’:

“They took her for their own purposes. Not the [[id:f2149cce-3f7e-4870-9381-741b73c1ae32][lizard people]] from
[[id:0a33b305-8f49-4a9f-8c0a-177cab9cd72c][Andromeda]], that’s the Imperial Dynasty. She’s been taken somewhere
different.”

[[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal Navy]] officials refused to comment on this allegation. One
Congressman was overheard joking “Does anyone listen to that loon’s
shows? Except his precious lizard people from Andromeda, of course!”
