* Thargoid Assault Continues

/13 Jan 3304/

Reed's Rest in [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] and Obsidian Orbital in [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] are the latest starports to be targeted by the Thargoids. 

Authorities in the affected systems have appealed to independent pilots to deliver foods, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics, and to evacuate civilians from the pertinent starports. 

The attack against Obsidian Orbital is likely to dismay the galactic community, as the starport – the result of a community initiative involving thousands of pilots – is seen by many as a symbol of unity.
