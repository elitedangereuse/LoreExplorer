  "The grandest society of merchants in the Universe."

  --- self-applied description of the East India Company, 1600-1708

During the centuries in which humanity was confined to a single planet,
corporations were naturally limited in size and influence, life fish in
a bowl. While access to a finite quantity of natural resources, and a
relatively small arena in which to compete, corporations could not
achieve their full theoretical potential.

But with the advent of interstellar travel, the fishbowl became an
ocean. Corporations could access and exploit entire planets for their
mineral resources, and an expading population, eagerly colonising system
after system, meant a growing customer base.

To the governments of the time, the potential for corporate growth was
both thrilling and terrifying; commercial prosperity meant increased tax
revenue and higher employment figures, but also raised the worrying
prospect of security fleets that could rival the official militaries. It
seemed inevitable that the largest corporations would, in time, become
the equivalent of nation-states in their own right. With the old
restrictions gone, there was simply nothing to stop them.

Today this vision has been partly fulfilled, with several corporations
owning entire systems. For many corporate employees, the age-old
distinction between a home and a workplace has vanished. Workers on
corporate-owned ships, refineries and outposts can expect to spend their
entire lives in the embrace of the company.

Despite their immense wealth and power, the corporations have thus far
been content to operate within -- and remain subject to -- the
jurisdictions of the Alliance, Empire and Federation, rather than mount
a serious challenge to any of them. Commentators point to two reasons
for this. Firstly, corporations thrive by excelling in their chosen
fields, and assuming the onerous responsibilities of a government would
be a wasteful distraction from the corporate mission. Secondly, given
that the corporations already hold much of the real power (especially in
the Federation), there is nothing to be gained by abolishing the
convenient veneer of the state. Better to operate below the surface,
make a show of compliance, and trust in the power of money to smooth the
way forward.

Faulcon Manspace, originally a small military supply company,
experienced an overnight reversal of fortune when it released the Viper
fighter, which proved popular with governments and private citizens
alike. Indeed, demand was so high that Faulcon Manspace had to farm out
Viper production to other companies under licence.

With wealth came innovation and a range of new designs. Like the Viper,
these new ships were named after dangerous snakes: the Cobra marked the
company's entry into the trader market, while the lightweight, versatile
Sidewinder was designed principally as a reconnaissance craft.

As the company's wealth grew, it began to absorb many of the companies
to which it had previously granted manufacturing contracts. In almost
all cases, the target companies' close working relationship with Faulcon
Manspace made such acquisitions frictionless and mutually beneficial. In
2982, the corporation merged with one of the largest such manufacturers,
deLacy ShipWorks, becoming Faulcon deLacy.

The company pioneered the now-standard modular system of ship design
that allows pilots to swap out components with ease. Significantly, the
company made the schematics for the modular system freely available to
its manufacturing rivals, broadening the choice of compatible modules
available to pilots and thus making the Faulcon deLacy marques more
popular.

Without this philosophy of component compatibility, spacecraft
maintenance might have become a nightmarish scenario in which being
unable to get the proper parts could leave a broken-down ship stranded
in drydock for weeks, or worse subject to bodged repair attempts.

Today, Faulcon deLacy stands out as one of the most enduring, widespread
and consistently admired corporations in colonised space. Public regard
for the company is so high that the Alliance. Empire and Federation have
all made attempts to secure exclusivity to Faulcon deLacy starships.
Thus far, their efforts have been unsuccessful.
