* 0197 Onionhead Banned
[[id:b634e896-9d3d-4f44-9783-cfb8fd6d0c56][Kappa Fornacis]]

In late 3300 President [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] declared the rare narcotic
'Onionhead' illegal throughout Federal space. [[id:7f3533a9-ff80-4f30-af29-1b0cf658e2ee][Onionhead]] is the fruit
of on alien plant on [[id:53188f1f-8959-4e53-a50e-a9098fb1d15b][Panem]] in the [[id:b634e896-9d3d-4f44-9783-cfb8fd6d0c56][Kappa Fornacis]] system.

[[id:bfe1169b-d808-4619-993d-d22f4f228a71][Geogio Algeria]], spokesman for the [[id:4be1331d-cd9d-4a4a-9fd4-cdbfda93356f][Farmer's Cooperative]] in the Kappa
Fornacis system, accused the President of victimisation.

Tensions between the Onionhead cultivators and the Federation
continued to rise, culminating in the bombing of Panem by the [[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal
Navy]]. This action seemed to have little effect as a brand new strain
of Onionhead was subsequently discovered in markets, having been
cultivated somewhere on [[id:5c234ef0-d5d7-4e22-9763-8cb2fbccb84d][Luca]] in the [[id:267299e4-1a3f-4835-933d-7a1b30d7d43e][Tanmark]] system.
