* Common Symptoms Among Damaged Crops

/06 Oct 3305/

The Interstellar Association for Agriculture has identified similarities in the crop failures reported in multiple systems over the past several weeks. 

Dr Genevieve Kane, a spokesperson for the organisation, outlined a pattern of common biological markers contained in diseased harvests of staple food crops.  

“We have collated multiple reports in which farmers recorded healthy crops withering in a matter of days. Agronomists have confirmed that the symptoms of decay are identical, and share genetic similarities to known pathogens, but have not yet identified the cause.” 

“The IAA is coordinating with other agricultural and scientific bodies to investigate this situation further.” 

The lack of staple foods has triggered a cascade effect across the core systems, leading to the panic buying and stockpiling of consumables. While non-perishable foodstuffs are keeping local populations fed, many authorities are struggling to address their citizens’ concerns. 

The following statement from Governor Nadeem Clayton of the Orerve system is typical of the announcements made by political leaders in affected systems: 

“I can assure you that the current disruption is merely temporary. We guarantee that critical food supplies will remain available, and urge the public not to overreact. A committee has been established to explore the possibility of financial support for landowners affected by this unfortunate situation.”
