* [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] Attracts Superpower Interest

/15 Nov 3305/

The discovery of an inhabited generation ship has attracted attention from both the Empire and the Federation. 

A recent trade appeal in the Upaniklis system provided the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] with emergency aid. Each of the superpowers has since deployed a megaship to the area, along with proposals for integrating the Golconda’s crew into the galactic community. 

Imperial senator Ava Cornelius released this statement: 

“This remarkable thousand-year mission exemplifies humanity’s indomitable spirit. We stand ready to help these colonists complete that mission by constructing a new planetary settlement exclusively for their use. There, they will finally be able to enjoy solid ground and open skies, in a colony that thrives under Imperial protection.” 

Federal Congressman Harlan Turk outlined an alternative approach: 

“As the descendants of a generation ship launched from Sol, we view these courageous travellers as honorary Federal citizens. We therefore hold that they are entitled to remain a spacefaring commune as their ancestors wished, and intend to honour their traditional way of life with an orbital outpost to call their own.” 

There has been minimal communication with the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]], and only a select few representatives of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated have interacted with the colonists. Assuming that the freshly donated supplies can fortify this micro-civilisation, vital decisions will need to be made regarding the Golconda’s future.
