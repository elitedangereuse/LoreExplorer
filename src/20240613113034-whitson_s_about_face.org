* 0701 Whitson's About Face
[[id:9cf1f79e-2474-4252-a9fd-c4420e942dc7][LP 339-7]]

[[id:6081180d-0e36-40dd-9f16-703ec4a5c365][Whitson Orbital]] was once owned by the [[id:6ea7e35f-f8a0-4b1e-a375-b7cf75f99588][Independent Values Party]], a
political group within 339. After the Split between [[id:d20f91af-3196-4258-ad57-64c7c61e5ed9][SE]] and [[id:c44f2965-3d8c-45e5-8f66-90e1b57aa83d][Blue
Creative]], the IVP put up a lot of political pressure to try and halt
the progress of Dr. [[id:246ac86d-4a96-4fdc-907d-d8a84b142e70][Chapman]]'s Corporation. They did this because of
their opposing views on [[id:7e054db9-2dac-4f8e-ade5-91b31dffae11][black market]] trading in 339. Dr. Chapman had
in the past accused the IVP of 'under the table transactions with
disreputable parties' and demanded that they close the black markets
in their stations. Dr. Chapman however is an accomplished diplomat and
spokes person and he did not take the IVPs pressure lying down. The
media helped to inflame events all the more and eventually hostilities
broke out between SE and IVP, spiralling finally into full blown civil
war. These were dark times for [[id:9cf1f79e-2474-4252-a9fd-c4420e942dc7][LP 339-7]] but SE corp threw the full
weight of their corporation against the declining IVP party and won
the war, taking control of Whitson Orbital in the process. Over the
course of the next few months Starship Enterprises turned Whitson
Orbital around, making it the principal trading post in the
system. Dr. Chapman overhauled two subsidiary companies to incorporate
into Whitsons infrastructure: the [[id:b9d52ada-77fd-4e28-a894-c50600845e16][Terran Wild-life Project]] which
[[id:4d2ace21-1658-4733-a922-e2fa97dfd3cd][clones]] species of Earth animals, and [[id:b916e81d-4c25-4f12-ab39-d2de81ad52a2][Galaxy Tours]], Starship
Enterprises sightseeing company.
