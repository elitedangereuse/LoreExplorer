* Terrorist Attacks on Imperial Starports

/10 Sep 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders* 

The Empire has broadcast this message across its emergency channels: 

“There have been multiple explosions within Mackenzie Relay station, in Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]’s home system of [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]]. [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] terrorists have claimed responsibility.”  

“In coordinated attacks they have also struck at Tsiolkovsky Terminal in the Gabjaujis system, Garrido Market in the LHS 4031 system, and Muller Terminal in the Rabh system.” 

“We urgently request assistance from the galactic community with repairing these starports and rescuing their populations.” 

The Imperial Internal Security Service issued a bulletin regarding this current threat: 

“The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA) is a paramilitary force of political extremists, whose activities have been small-scale until now.”  

“Marlinism is a well-known ideology inspired by Marlin Duval, who established the Republic of Achenar in the 23rd century prior to it becoming the Empire. Many people in the fringe systems are Marlinists, who want to replace hereditary Emperors with representation by elected senators. Neo-Marlinism is a more radical conviction that only terror tactics will force such change.” 

“The NMLA’s hatred of the Imperial Family explains why it has targeted starports under the Duval banner. But its use of portable military-grade explosives is unprecedented, suggesting an increase in resources.”
