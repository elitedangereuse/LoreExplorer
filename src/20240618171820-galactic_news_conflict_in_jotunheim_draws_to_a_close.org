* Galactic News: Conflict in Jotunheim Draws to a Close

/09 Jun 3303/

Authorities in Jotunheim have announced that the operation to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim from the system has succeeded. 

The organisation entered the system in order to bring it under Imperial control, but the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance was swiftly mobilised to repel the incursion. 

Both factions issued calls for support, and hundreds of independent combat pilots responded, but ultimately the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance emerged victorious. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has now withdrawn from the system. 

The success of the resistance operation was due in no small part to the support of [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]]. Scores of pilots responded to her request for commodities, which were then donated to Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance. 

As the conflict drew to a close, representatives of the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance and the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry thanked those who supported their operations. 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Big Harry's Monkey Hangout in the Jotunheim system.
