* Galactic News: Conflict in [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim Draws to a Close

/09 Jun 3303/

Authorities in [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim have announced that the operation to drive the Autocracy of Jotunheim from the system has succeeded. 

The organisation entered the system in order to bring it under Imperial control, but the Revolutionary [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim Resistance was swiftly mobilised to repel the incursion. 

Both factions issued calls for support, and hundreds of independent combat pilots responded, but ultimately the Revolutionary [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim Resistance emerged victorious. The Autocracy of Jotunheim has now withdrawn from the system. 

The success of the resistance operation was due in no small part to the support of [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]]. Scores of pilots responded to her request for commodities, which were then donated to Revolutionary [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim Resistance. 

As the conflict drew to a close, representatives of the Revolutionary [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim Resistance and the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry thanked those who supported their operations. 

Pilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Big Harry's Monkey Hangout in the [[id:addd8c74-2425-4d26-a1d5-9cb11ce6b0ba][Jotun]]heim system.
