* Cultist Occupation of Starport Continues

/22 Mar 3305/

Archambault Terminal in the Chun Tstar system remains under threat of nuclear destruction by the Children of Tothos. 

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim updated the media: 

“Despite the best efforts of our negotiators, the cultists remain in control of the starport and still intend to detonate the Lucifer Device. This 300 megaton weapon is capable of wiping out Archambault Terminal, along with the starport’s entire population.” 

“Their leader, Barnabas Cole, has transmitted messages via the starport’s comms array, repeating claims of ‘preparing to bring Tothos’s light to us all’. There is no mention of a deity named Tothos in historical or mythical records, which suggests the faith was recently founded by Cole.” 

“Despite this, several civilian ships arrived in the Chun Tstar system over the past few days, attracted by Cole’s sermons and seeking to join the cult. The FIA is monitoring the situation closely.”
