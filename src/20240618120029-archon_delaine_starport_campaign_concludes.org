* [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] Starport Campaign Concludes

/22 Apr 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

An initiative by the Kumo Crew syndicate to construct new starports for increasing trade has ended successfully. 

Pilots delivered large quantities of ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. Bounty vouchers were also offered to protect the shipments during transit. 

The Kumo Council has announced that rewards for both traders and bounty hunters are now available from Gabriel Enterprise via its loyal intermediaries, The Razor Whips. 

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd will now fulfil its contract and construct new Orbis starports. These will be in place on the 29th of April 3307 at the following locations: 

Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system 

HIP 18390, near the California Nebula 

HIP 10792, near the Sothis system 

HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula 

Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region 

A statement from [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] was published by The Pegasi Sentinel: 

“I am pleased to see that our trade routes can now extend into fresh territories. My people will be very grateful, I’m sure.” 

“What pleases me less is the huge number of criminal scum that tried to disrupt the project. This has forced me to invent some very creative reprisals, which I look forward to inflicting shortly.”
