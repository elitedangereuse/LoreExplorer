* Rebellion Spreads Across Federal Systems

/30 Jul 3307/

New Kuwembaa Labour, which controls five systems, has triggered a second wave of secession by severing ties with the Federation. 

Following the victory of the Azaladshu Free, a minority of Federal factions are breaking away from the superpower in protest against its civil surveillance laws. 

Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour made this statement: 

“The Federal government has granted itself draconian powers to spy on its own citizens. Regrettably, the only way to avoid this is to withdraw from the Federal Accord. I urge the president to respect our wishes and accept our sovereign status.” 

In response, President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] ordered Governor Mishra to abide by constitutional law or face the consequences. He has also redirected the Fortress Liberty megaship to the Kuwembaa system. 

Political commentators believe that three other democratic Federal factions are ready to follow the example of New Kuwembaa Labour. If this occurs, up to 28 further systems could become independent as a result. 

There are also reports that influential leaders within the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour, which both recently seceded, have expressed regret about leaving the Federation. The congressmen who previously represented them believe that these factions could be swayed to return.
