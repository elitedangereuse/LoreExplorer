* New Federal Vice President Selected

/24 Mar 3307/

President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] has announced that the new vice president of the Federation is [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]], replacing the deceased Brad Mitchell. 

Archer was previously serving as the Secretary of Security. Prior to becoming a congressman, he was a director of the Federal Intelligence Agency and had a long career in law enforcement. 

His predecessor, VP Brad Mitchell, died in the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] bombing of Li Qing Jao station in the [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] system. The attack also killed several members of the Federal Cabinet along with many government officials, who were attending a meeting at the starport. 

Addressing a gathering of Congress, Vice President Archer said: 

“My primary focus in this office will be to increase security throughout the Federation. I vow to build vigilance into the fabric of our society, and prevent such atrocities from ever happening again.” 

During the congressional session, President Hudson announced new appointments for other deceased members of the Cabinet. He also successfully obtained approval to increase funding for counter-terrorism operations run by ACT and the Federal Navy.
