* Galactic News: Joint Superpower Initiative Announced

/05 Aug 3303/

In recent weeks, a number of programmes have been launched to gather further information about the Thargoids. While the Federation has established an outpost in HIP 17692 to monitor Thargoid activity, independent organisation Abroin Universal PLC recently completed a campaign to amass material for a research centre in the Pleiades Nebula. 

But not everyone believes such initiatives represent the best way to proceed, with a growing number of voices calling for an inter-superpower initiative that consolidates existing knowledge and resources. 

Now these individuals are about to have their wishes granted. At a hastily convened press conference in the Sorbago system, Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] of the Achenar Research Council announced that a confederacy of scientists from the Empire, Federation and Alliance has united to establish a new organisation: Aegis. The organisation’s remit will be to gather further intelligence on the Thargoids and coordinate all future research. 

Professor Tesreau said: 

“While I applaud recent efforts to learn more about the Thargoids, we can achieve far more by working together. It is imperative that we coordinate our efforts, and share our knowledge and expertise. That is what Aegis has been created to achieve.” 

“Naturally, the cold war between the Federation and the Empire has complicated efforts to make this initiative a reality. Fortunately, while there may be antagonism between our governments, there is a strong desire for collaboration and cooperation within the scientific community.” 

Having received substantial funding from all three superpowers, Aegis will soon establish its first research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula.
