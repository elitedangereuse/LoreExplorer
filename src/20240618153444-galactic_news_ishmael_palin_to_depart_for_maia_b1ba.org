* Galactic News: Ishmael Palin to Depart for Maia b1ba

/07 Feb 3302/

It has been several weeks since Professor Ishmael Palin, the scientist researching the Unknown Artefacts, appealed for help in establishing a new research outpost on Maia b1ba. The appeal was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a huge influx of deliveries to Obsidian Orbital, Professor Palin's base of operations. But since then there has been no news about the new research base, prompting some to wonder if it would in fact materialise. 

In a statement released today, Professor Palin explained the reasons for the hold-up, and reassured the public that the research base would go ahead: 

"I know the galactic community is eager to unravel the mystery of the Unknown Artefacts. The fact is that my team and I were sidetracked by our recent breakthroughs with the UAs and meta-alloys. I can assure the public, however, that the new research outpost will go ahead â€“ in fact, my team and I will be departing for Maia b1ba imminently." 

The professor's ship, containing a wealth of valuable research material, is expected to set off in the next 24 hours.
