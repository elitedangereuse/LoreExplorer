* The Long Trip Home

/19 Feb 3301/

After a week of wandering in HIP 110620 the [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Starport is now making its way through HIP 110079. GalNet is still no closer to learning the reason behind the station's unexpected return, nor can we ascertain where the cyborg barman's ultimate destination may be. 

A number of well known commanders from all walks of life have been seen coming in and out of [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]], which is fast becoming a popular nightspot among young thrillseekers from the Empire, Federation and Alliance alike.  

Now that his self-imposed exile has finally come to an end, [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] appears content to simply wander the stars in the company of a people he once called his own, accompanied by the booming sound of a dark electric beat.
