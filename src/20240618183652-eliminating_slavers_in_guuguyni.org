* Eliminating Slavers in Guuguyni

/19 Jan 3304/

Princess Aisling Duval has announced plans to fund a peacekeeping operation in the Guuguyni system. The operation's primary purpose is to neutralise an illegal slave-trading ring in the region. 

Princess Duval released the following statement, elaborating on the nature of the campaign: 

"Illegal slavery is an abhorrent practice that negates its victim's fundamental human rights. The amoral profiteers operating in Guuguyni must be stopped." 

The Guuguyni Empire Consulate has been authorised to oversee the campaign, and has pledged to reward pilots who hand in bounty vouchers at Shen Terminal in the Guuguyni system. 

The campaign begins on the 18th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
