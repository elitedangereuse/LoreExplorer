* Silver Allied Network Implicated in Attack on Emperor!

/20 Apr 3301/

Thousands of Imperial bounty hunters answered the call of Princess
[[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa]] over the last week, joining her in the hunt to uncover the
identity of the cabal behind the cowardly attack on the ailing
Emperor.

Acting on the advice of several trustworthy members of the Imperial
court, the Princess began by disrupting several large-scale criminal
operations taking place in [[id:1b91efee-b411-45a9-8b03-df967281885d][Nehet]] and [[id:c72ce3b7-f19e-4034-9df5-554bcddfaa4f][Mictlan]]. Hundreds of Imperial
Commanders loyal to the Princess descended on the systems in
force. The fury of the makeshift fleet shattered the local gangs, and
within 24 hours the fighting was over.

Information uncovered during the strike on Mictlan led investigators
to [[id:823c6413-b477-4227-a74f-683c30f42019][LTT 9810]], a system under the protection of Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina
Torval]]. There it became apparent that a rogue division of the LTT 9810
[[id:8c17d34d-72ce-4b62-b4a1-a9cf789fbc9d][Silver Allied Network]] had been acting as a financial consultancy
service for some of the more successful Imperial crime families.

Senator Torval, along with SAN’s board of directors, has denied any
knowledge of the rogue division’s activity. They have now opened up
their records to Princess [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa]]’s investigators, who are currently
hard at work trying to trace a series of payments that they believe
may lead back to the cabal responsible for the attack.

The Princess has requested that members of her fleet remain close to
[[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]]. As soon as any new information is available, the next stage
of the investigation will begin.
