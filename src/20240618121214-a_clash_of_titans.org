A Clash of Titans 
 
In this third article in GalNet’s series about the defining moments in
human history, famed historian [[id:e13ec234-b603-4a29-870d-2b87410195ea][Sima Kalhana]] discusses the first [[id:1f37cad9-f017-4253-ae21-915fee1285a2][war]]
between the Federation and what would become the Empire.

Although there had been other small-scale incidents beyond the Solar
System, the war between the Federation and Achenar (as it was then)
was notable as the first large-scale interstellar conflict. Much has
been made over the years of the Federation’s reasons for invading
Achenar, in particular the claim that the annihilation of the native
sentient species was little more than a slim pretext. While it was
certainly true that the principal reason for the military action was
Achenar’s refusal to join the Federation, it is also worth noting that
the protection of xeno-culture and life forms was a key tenet of the
Federation’s founding.

Under the command of Admiral [[id:8e40b676-782d-4395-a409-beec9df1a338][Richard Morgan]], a fleet was assembled at
[[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]] and began its transit to Achenar towards the end
of 2323. That region of space was relatively unexplored and thinly
populated at the time, meaning that the fleet lacked the logistical
support needed for a mission of this scale.

Despite a long and fragile supply line, Morgan chose to engage the
defenders in a single large battle. Achenar was alerted to the plan
and laid an ambush for the invaders, applying the infamous
pack-hunting formation against the Federal fleet initially, then
against its supply lines.

Throughout 2324 the Federal fleet continued to try and establish a
foothold in the system, but with little success. The constant
attrition took its toll on the invaders and in 2325 Achenar
counterattacked in what is now remembered as the ‘Great Battle of
Liberation’. Every local ship, civilian and military, was pressed into
service in a coordinated attack against every element of the invasion
fleet.

The battle succeeded in pushing the Federal fleet out of Achenar and
they retreated to their base in Beta Hydri. Bolstered by improved
supply, the Federal fleet held its ground. Skirmishing between the two
navies continued for another fifty years. During this time, and seeing
the need for a buffer zone around their home system, Henson Duval
expanded into the nearby systems. This heralded the change from a
single-system colony to a pan-system empire, and so the Empire as we
know it today was born.
