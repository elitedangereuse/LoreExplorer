* [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] Elected as Federal President

/16 Oct 3309/

The Federation has voted to elect [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] as its next president, with a four per cent vote majority over her rival Jerome Archer. 

The current shadow president of the Liberal Party will be officially inaugurated in the new year, entering an eight-year term of office. Congressman Isolde Rochester will also be sworn in as vice president in Winters’s administration.  

President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] will remain in power during the transition period, but will not be expected to implement any major policy changes. The Liberal Party will replace the Republican Party as the superpower’s governing authority in 3310, with Jerome Archer assuming the role of shadow president. 

President-elect Winters addressed her supporters during a celebratory rally in Olympus Village on Mars: 

“The people of the Federation have spoken! I thank you all for turning my party’s vision into a reality. My aim is to govern fairly for everybody, regardless of their political allegiance. Together we will create optimism where there was fear, give shelter those who are vulnerable, and improve the quality of life for each and every Federal citizen.” 

Vice President Jerome Archer formally conceded the election during a session of Congress: 

“My compliments to Felicia Winters, who fought a strong campaign. I look forward to taking on the role of shadow president next year, and ensuring that her government’s proposals are thoroughly scrutinised from day one.” 

Former presidents [[id:e70b7d46-d965-4fb7-859b-e67cacd230e5][Antonia Madison]] and [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] – whom Winters temporarily replaced after the Starship One disaster – offered their congratulations. Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] of the Alliance, First Minister Octavia Volkov of the Marlinist Colonies, and CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] of Sirius Corporation sent similar messages to the Winters campaign. 

No formal acknowledgement was received from the Empire. However, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] joined Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] and other members of Aegis leadership to state: “We trust that President Winters will remain committed to our unified approach, ensuring the development of technology needed to secure victory in the ongoing Thargoid war.”
