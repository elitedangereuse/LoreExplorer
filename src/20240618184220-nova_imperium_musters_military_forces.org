* Nova Imperium Musters Military Forces

/05 Jan 3305/

The isolationist group Nova Imperium is reported to be assembling its forces in the Paresa system. 

Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] made this statement: 

“We have evidence that this seditious organisation is amassing an armada in its home system. It consists of ships crewed by Imperator Mordanticus’s ex-Navy followers, as well as the private vessels of many misguided citizens.” 

“As Admiral of the Fleet, I order Nova Imperium to disperse its forces immediately or face the consequences.” 

The Imperial Herald’s [[id:745efc38-c548-40c0-81d2-82973c604d37][Cassia Carvalho]] commented: 

“Widespread support for [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] has led to Nova Imperium amassing its fleet in a very short time. The challenge for the Imperial Navy is to quash this threat without it being seen as a massacre of Imperial citizens, which can only fuel further rebellion.”
