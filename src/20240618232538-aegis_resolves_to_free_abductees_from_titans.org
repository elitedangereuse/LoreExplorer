* Aegis Resolves to Free Abductees from Titans

/25 Sep 3309/

With human life-signs now confirmed beneath the hulls of the Thargoid Titans, the urgency to mount a rescue mission has intensified.  

Many pilots equipped with the updated pulse wave xeno scanner detected signals that match living humans on every Titan mothership. As a result, Aegis has prioritised finding a way to recover the abducted. A potential solution has emerged, reportedly via a low-ranking engineer within [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation. 

Director [[id:878b6075-e168-4d0a-bb0f-9e6103c7f033][Ivano Colombera]], the Empire’s scientific liaison to Aegis, explained: 

“Li Yong-Rui has shared [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation’s projects to counter Thargoid abductions, and this has accelerated our work. Among their research was a blueprint that repurposes sub-surface displacement missiles – a commonly used mining tool – to breach Thargoid vessels and expose captured escape pods.” 

“These missiles were originally designed to extract mineral deposits from within asteroids without causing its destruction. Our consensus is that with some modifications, they could be deployed to target the human storage chambers within the Titan and retrieve the captives safely.” 

Aden Tanner discussed the approach with cautious optimism: 

“This could be the non-lethal rescue method we've been searching for. However, these missiles are intended for minerals not people, and Thargoid technology is poorly understood. We must ensure that we won't inadvertently harm those we’re trying to save, and prevent an aggressive reaction from the Titans themselves if possible.” 

Aegis confirmed that it has begun manufacturing prototype sub-surface missiles capable of penetrating the Titans’ outer hulls. Further developments are expected to be announced shortly.
