* Galactic News: Culinary Appeal Concludes

/24 Nov 3303/

Independent Leesti for Equality has announced that its appeal for rare food and drink has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to George Lucas Station, the organisation’s base of operations. 

Elias Hampton, a spokesperson for Independent Leesti for Equality, said: 

“Thanks to those who responded to our appeal, Lunch in Leesti looks set to be a resounding success. We would like to thank the many intrepid pilots who supplied us with rare foods from distant systems.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from George Lucas Station in the Leesti system.
