in 2974, [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] pushed further. Another invasion began in the
Ackwada system. This time, instead of sending a 'privateer'
battlegroup, the Empire supllied ships and equipment directly to the
system's residents. The '[[id:218b9d36-522d-4b1c-828d-f0496cdea5c5][Yorkville Partriots]]' rose up and defeated the
Federation fleet six weeks after they arrived.
