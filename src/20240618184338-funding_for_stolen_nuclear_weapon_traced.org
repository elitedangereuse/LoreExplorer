* Funding for Stolen Nuclear Weapon Traced

/22 Feb 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has traced the funding of an illegal nuclear research outpost to the Zlota system. 

Senior Agent Rochelle Karim provided the following details: 

“Having successfully decrypted the outpost’s communications, we have determined that Zlota Federal Holdings was financing these unregistered research projects. Several of the organisation’s principal figures were covertly redirecting public funds to construct portable nuclear weapons.” 

“We suspect that one of these individuals became greedy and arranged for the outpost to be raided, acquiring the prototype Lucifer Device to subsequently sell on the black market.” 

“The FIA is currently questioning the Zlota Executive Council to learn more. It is crucial that we locate the Lucifer Device, which poses a serious threat to public safety.”
