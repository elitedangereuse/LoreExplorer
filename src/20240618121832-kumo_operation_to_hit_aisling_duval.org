* Kumo Operation to Hit [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]

Kumo Operation to Hit [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] 
 
Ever the opportunists, Kumo Crew commanders have swept across a number of systems controlled by [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] in the last seven days. They penetrated deeper than in any previous skirmish, and elevated the level of danger faced by Imperial citizens as a result of the Pegasi Pirate War. 

With turmoil affecting billions of Imperial citizens and sweeping them into the ongoing saga, Commanders and tacticians have begun to realise that the conflict has taken on a new dimension. Leaked intelligence indicates that as the week draws to a close, Archon will focus his attention on planets and stations pledged to [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]. 

With Kumo Crew attacks imminent, the Empire must decide how to best fortify its strongholds against further incursion while trying to stem their enemyâ€™s momentum. What was once thought of as a simple operation now draws on the strength and resources of a thousand worlds. 

Commander Mikalus
