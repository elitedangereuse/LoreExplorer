* Galactic News: The Gnosis Takes Flight

/25 May 3303/

Over the past few days, news feeds in the Varati system have provided extensive coverage of the maiden voyage of the Gnosis, a scientific-research vessel commissioned by the Canonn Interstellar Research Group. 

The state-of-the art ship is the result of a community initiative that saw the public contribute huge quantities of material. In fact, the response from the galactic community was so positive that construction was completed ahead of schedule. 

The ship has now taken up position in orbit around Varati A6, and has already begun welcoming visitors and dignitaries from the core systems.
