Zy the Beagle was the epitome of the phrase "Man's Best Friend". Endlessly loyal and loving. Zy made sure his Commander was cuddled relentlessly after returning from a long journey; whether it was to another system, nebula, black hole... or just the local shop. / He spent his days dashing around, making friends with anyone who came near him and accompanying CMDR Chrispy Toast as his official "Exploring Buddy", on his adventures through space, often wrapped in a blanket. /To all Commanders who find this beacon, raise your hand and salute o7 to Zy. May he run wild and free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
