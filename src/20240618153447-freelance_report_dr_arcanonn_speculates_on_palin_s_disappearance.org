* Freelance Report: [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Dr Arcanonn]] Speculates on Palin's Disappearance

/15 Feb 3302/

Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has spoken out about the disappearance of Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]]: 

"I hope that the professor is safe, but I feel a growing sense that he is no longer with us. As was recently made public, I am currently in hiding because a credible threat to my life was received. My fear is that the dark forces that sought to end my life have intercepted Palin on his way to Maia b1ba." 

"We were told that the Diamondback Explorer that made the 'high-speed pass' at Obsidian Orbital appeared to be looking for something. Could it have been looking for the professor?" 

"We didn't always see eye to eye, but Professor Palin is – or was – a great scientist and he is sorely missed." 

Commander Lord Zoltan
