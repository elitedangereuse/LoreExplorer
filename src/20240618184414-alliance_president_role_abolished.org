* Alliance President Role Abolished

/21 Jun 3305/

The Alliance Assembly has permanently dissolved the role of President of the Alliance, following the recent revelations about [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]]’s multiple crimes. 

Summarising the vote, Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] said: 

“Recent events have made it clear that the presidential position is open to misuse, which places the integrity of the Alliance at risk. Following a thorough debate on the matter, this Assembly has voted – by an overwhelming majority – to remove the role from our constitution.” 

“The defunct Office of the Alliance President will now be restructured. Many emissaries will be retained to serve as the non-political ambassadors they were intended to be. Councillor Elijah Beck has volunteered to resign in order to oversee the new department.” 

“We hope that this unfortunate chapter of Alliance history has now been brought to an end.” 

An earlier vote held during the same session has selected Admiral Tahir West of the [[id:0b991a8e-234a-4888-8c0a-b3c64498f217][Tionisla]] fleet to join the Council of Admirals, replacing the disgraced [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Frederick Yamamoto]].
