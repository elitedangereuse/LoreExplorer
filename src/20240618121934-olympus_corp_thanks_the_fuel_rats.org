* Olympus Corp Thanks the Fuel Rats

/09 Oct 3301/

Commander [[id:a3e776db-e627-4712-85e2-12667901f336][F-Zlim]] was on the home stretch of a six-month galactic tour
when a CO2 leak knocked him out. When he woke to the blare of alarms,
his ship, the '[[id:0332501d-5b43-4396-b11e-41cda8906b9c][Korblah]]', was out of fuel. Using long-range comms,
F-Zlim notified fellow Commanders at the exploration arm of the
[[id:4d701921-5368-403e-a759-a50bb2e1180a][Olympus Corp]]. that he had exactly two minutes and 48 seconds of air
remaining. Using the last of the ship's backup battery, he transmitted
his final location via the captain's log module, and then he called
the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]].

"I had 50 seconds of oxygen left when the first refuel drone arrived,"
said Commander [[id:a3e776db-e627-4712-85e2-12667901f336][F-Zlim]]. "It was the most exhilarating and frightening
experience in the six months of my journey. The [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] saved me and
I am eternally grateful."

In recognition of for their valiant service, the Olympus Corporation
has chosen to award the first-ever Korblah Medal to Commanders [[id:2fc485fa-5002-46ce-a7df-c07608976f6e][Orphius]]
and [[id:c48ed3fe-4a54-465b-9df5-f041fbbc9ccd][Lokda Babybel]] of the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]].
