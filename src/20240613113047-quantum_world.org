Distant Worlds II was an ambitious five-month expedition to the far outer rim. It launched from the Pallaeni system in January 3305 and reached its final destination of Beagle Point in May 3305. The purpose of the expedition was to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, and to construct a starport at Sagittarius A*. / This planet was a last-minute addition to the Distant Worlds route, and with a radius of just 137 km is one of the smallest recorded planets in the galaxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
