* Galactic News: Bentonio's Request Rebuffed

/13 May 3302/

[[id:48690cd8-5d02-477b-9964-dbd1d3303936][Arlo Cortez]], a member of [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]]'s personal staff, has
responded to a recent statement from [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]], the notorious
conspiracy theorist. In an official press release, Cortez said:

"The suggestion that Jasmina has been somehow 'silenced' by oppressive
governmental powers is patently ridiculous. The decision to admit
Jasmina to the Clearwater Clinic was made by her friends and
family. No one else was involved."

Cortez also said that Bentonio's request to meet with Halsey would not
be granted:

"Our paramount concern is that Jasmina receives the care and attention
she needs. She will not be meeting with members of the press,
representatives of the Federation, or crackpot conspiracy theorists."
