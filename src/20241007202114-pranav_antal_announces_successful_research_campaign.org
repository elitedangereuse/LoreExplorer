* Pranav Antal Announces Successful Research Campaign

/15 Aug 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Utopia’s campaign in the Polevnic system has ended, with Pranav Antal offering his thanks to independent pilots. 

The requested deliveries of commodities and encoded materials arrived at Tanner Settlement starport in the Polevnic system. The Guardians of Harmony, which managed the initiative, is now arranging payment on behalf of Antal for all pilots who took part. 

Simguru Pranav Antal transmitted a celebratory message that was broadcast by all newsfeeds: 

“These materials will be put to effective use in several key projects. Our simulation technology, including the Sim Archive, can be properly maintained and calibrated to provide reality-adjacent experiences for our community in search of future technological breakthroughs.” 

“Recently, I have come to better appreciate the wisdom of my late father Rishi Antal, who founded Utopia decades ago. Accessing his memories helped me realise the necessity of isolating our commune, in pursuit of our ultimate goal of establishing the Acheron Interface. But, on this occasion, I felt the support of those outside Utopia who believe in the importance of our project. Thank you.” 

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, offered a brief comment following claims of exerting pressure on Utopia: 

“I am not going to dignify such brash words from Pranav with a public denial. My role as a representative of Sirius Corporation’s many shareholders demands that I seek profit and potential in all areas of colonised space. Utopia is no different, and I look forward to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement with Pranav personally.” 

Participants can now collect their rewards from Tanner Settlement.
