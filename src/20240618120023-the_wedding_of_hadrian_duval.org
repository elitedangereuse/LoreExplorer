* The Wedding of [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]]

/05 Apr 3307/

Imperator [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Augustus Duval]], leader of the isolationist group
[[id:64e89e89-f7fe-4f90-bc29-1cd90497e1f1][Nova Imperium]], has married his consort [[id:ef9ddb06-8cb2-4c3f-a688-469be3149aa9][Astrid Minerva]] in a closed
ceremony.

Commander Minerva was a young Imperial pilot who aided [[id:64e89e89-f7fe-4f90-bc29-1cd90497e1f1][Nova Imperium]]
at the [[id:c0a7a8bc-9add-49fb-b79e-18df5696e2b7][Battle of Paresa]] in 3305 and became a loyal supporter. Her
official title is now Lady [[id:ef9ddb06-8cb2-4c3f-a688-469be3149aa9][Astrid Minerva-Duval]].

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] personally attended her cousin’s wedding at a
secure location. She referred to it as “a precious moment of joy in
these bleak times”.

The [[id:7210d36a-25f5-4c8e-8cf2-069de549d438][Imperial Palace]] and the [[id:6b539fa1-7ebe-44d3-874b-41a3bd400af9][Senate]] have sent congratulatory messages,
and the event was covered by mainstream media.

[[id:4ccd6e9c-1bdb-4319-b951-2ef6919707fa][Paresa News Network]]: “Astrid’s well-deserved rise to nobility has made
her fellow [[id:9147b1a8-a73f-4144-b614-8e876943c10e][Paresans]] very proud. Everyone at PNN is overjoyed for the
happy couple!”

[[id:9e04a792-7d27-4492-b430-8bd8673d7454][Eye on Achenar]]: “It’s an insult to the noble [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duval]] bloodline when some
trigger-jockey from a gutter system can sink her claws into the
Emperor’s own nephew.”

[[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][The Imperial Herald]]: “Hadrian taking a bride at the age of 20 has
surprised many. If he becomes the only Duval to produce heirs, it will
place pressure on [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Emperor Arissa]] and [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Princess Aisling]], neither of whom
have consorts.”

In related news, Nova Imperium vessels are participating in the
current conflict against the [[id:ec1cb30c-2e72-410b-a664-0d609a352100][Neo-Marlinists]] of [[id:bb9435b7-f21d-4afc-8ca6-a57d0fd51065][Mudhrid]]. Praetor [[id:3fdf3f05-e7b5-436f-906e-e67dafa5d254][Leo
Magnus]], head of security, is liaising with the [[id:01980efc-1b06-4f55-bf18-fa6c7e56f1eb][IISS]] on anti-terrorism
intelligence.
