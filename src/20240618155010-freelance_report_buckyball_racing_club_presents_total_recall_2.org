* Freelance Report: Buckyball Racing Club Presents Total Recall 2

/25 Aug 3302/

Following the success of the Total Recall race in April, the Buckyball Racing Club has once again been contacted by a leading manufacturer of SRV tyres to help improve its public profile. Pilots from remote settlements throughout human space have claimed that the latest TrakMark tyres are not fit for purpose, resulting in damage to SRVs after just a few kilometres. It's up to the Buckyball Racing Club to prove them wrong. 

The race, which starts in the Cernobog system, runs from the 27th of August to the 4th of September.
