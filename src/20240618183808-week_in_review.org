* Week in Review

/01 Jul 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

Chief Inspector [[id:9d17bf0f-6ce5-46b2-b9e6-2cab238fcce7][Kay Kilbride]] has been murdered by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation. The incident took place in the city of New Rossyth on Turner’s World. In the wake of Inspector Kilbride’s death, Alliance Interpol has assigned Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt to assume the role of taskforce liaison. 

There has been a range of reactions to news that Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] and Federal Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] are to marry. A congratulatory message was sent from the Imperial Palace, but there was no comment from Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]]. Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] was frank in her disapproval, while Senator [[id:1d3d8a69-609b-4e83-b1a1-a46cb23ba195][Caspian Leopold]], who was rumoured to be courting [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]], was more supportive. 

Aegis has announced that it will allow technology brokers to reduce their requirements for items, in order to increase overall combat effectiveness against the Thargoids. A spokesperson for Aegis said the galactic community had worked hard to oppose the Thargoids, and that Aegis would therefore make it easier for independent pilots to obtain advanced weaponry and hardware. 

Meanwhile, an emergency report from Aegis has confirmed that the Thargoids have launched a large-scale assault on the [[id:4af71116-980a-4119-b93e-a0b368cf9550][Deciat]] system. The organisation has called on all members of the galactic community for assistance in defending the system, which is home to the Garay Terminal starport. 

A fringe religion that worships the Thargoids has become the target of hostility, with large numbers of civilian protestors reacting angrily to the sect’s openly pro-Thargoid stance. Authorities have responded with assurances that the sect’s members are harmless, and that criminal acts against them may result in prosecution. 

In other news, scientists in [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] have announced plans to build an outpost to monitor the region’s population and resources. Professor Alexei de la [[id:12db1b22-8d5c-482f-a91b-00021258a388][Vega]], who is heading the project, said the proposed outpost would focus on ensuring that the ever-expanding region would have sufficient resources in the long term. 

Finally, an operation to support construction of an Aegis military facility in the Pleiades Nebula has reached a successful conclusion. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering mined resources to The Oracle, and by protecting traders in the system. 

And those are the main stories this week.
