* Los Chupacabras Campaign Concludes

/01 Jun 3304/

Los Chupacabras have announced that their plan to host a music festival in the LFT 926 system has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Meredith City, the organisationâ€™s base of operations. 

Los Chupacabras thanked those who supported the campaign, and confirmed that a second festival is already being planned. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Meredith City in the LFT 926 system.
