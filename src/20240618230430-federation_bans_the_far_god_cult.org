* Federation Bans the Far God Cult

/19 Oct 3308/

President Hudson has approved a congressional bill to make the Order of the Far God illegal within all Federal systems. 

Congress voted to accept the resolution by a narrow majority, as announced by Secretary of State Lana Berkovich: 

“The Thargoids are categorised as an enemy of the state, and the Federal Accord forbids any citizen from providing aid to such enemies. The likelihood of radicalised Thargoid worshippers disrupting our anti-xeno operations in the name of their deity deserves a proactive response.” 

“Therefore, by Act of Congress, membership of this religious order is now a crime punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment. The organisation is barred from operating anywhere in Federal space. All detained Far God adherents are being interrogated for information related to espionage, with many already transported to stand trial in their home systems.” 

Congress has clarified that the resolution specifically targets ‘organisations which actively support the military objectives of non-humans’. It does not apply to civil groups promoting inter-species communication or diplomacy, such as the Thargoid Advocacy Project. 

The Galactic Interfaith Commune and similar agencies have protested against the new law. Shadow President Felicia Winters shared their disapproval, claiming that “such intolerance does not reflect the Federation’s core values”. Some congressmen have also voiced fears of the potential impact on voters who follow other fringe religions. 

With the Far God cult now illegal in both the Empire and the Federation, its hive-chapels can only be found in Allied and independent systems with local laws permitting religious liberty. The True Chapters sect’s remaining adherents are concentrated aboard the Perdition and Testament megaships, the locations of which are unknown.
