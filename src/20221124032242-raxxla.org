* Raxxla

#+begin_quote

  "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the
  whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's
  grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To
  Raxxla!"

  --- Alleged toast of the Dark Wheel

The legend of Raxxla has been circulating, in whispers, for centuries.
The quest for this mysterious place, the location of which is a deadly
secret, was said to be the principal aim of the Dark Wheel, a putative
fraternity of legend-chasers from the early days of interstellar travel.

The earliest recorded mention of Raxxla dates from 2296, from the
journal of Art Tornqvist, a shipboard mechanic based in the Tau Ceti
system. He writes: 'Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories,
a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate
stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up.
maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!' Although Tornqvist's
account is the first known attestation of Raxxla, it is clear from
context that the myth was already in circulation.

It is extremely difficult to find consistency among the various
fragmentary rumours of Raxxla. Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis,
El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John, interpretations of the story
range from the sceptical to the outlandish: Raxxla has been suggested to
be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic
enlightenment. The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several
points, however: that Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a
mystical secret.

Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the
Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel
universes can be accessed. These details, however, were later shown to
bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel
and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some
Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed
facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with
eyes to see.

Students of Raxxla lore have noted that the legend exerts a strangely
potent fascination on the minds of seekers. Commentators have compared
this sensation to 'fernweh', the unaccountable longing for a place one
has never seen. More than one interstellar treasure-seeker has become
obsessed with Raxxla to the exclusion of all other dreams, and spent his
or her entire life in a futile search for it.

Raxxla also plays a role in several conspiracy theories, most of which
attest that it has already been discovered by some kind of sinister
cabal (or sole tyrant), which has leveraged its power to establish
covert dominance over humanity.

Whatever the truth of the matter, one thing remains irrefutable: the
legend of Raxxla continues to inspire explorers and conspiracy theorists
to this day.
