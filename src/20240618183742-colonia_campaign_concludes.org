* Colonia Campaign Concludes

/25 May 3304/

The campaign to supply a scientific project in Colonia has now concluded. Hundreds of independent pilots made the journey to deliver microresources to the Colonia Co-operative in the Coeus system. 

Professor Alexei de la Vega, in charge of the research project, made this statement: 

“These vital materials will allow us to establish a framework for how the region can expand. Thank you to everyone who has helped to chart a roadmap for Colonia’s future.” 

Pilots who contributed to the project can now collect their rewards from Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.
