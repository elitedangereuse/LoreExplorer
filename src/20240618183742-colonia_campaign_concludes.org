/25 May 3304/

The campaign to supply a scientific project in [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] has now concluded. Hundreds of independent pilots made the journey to deliver microresources to the Colonia Co-operative in the Coeus system. 

Professor Alexei de la [[id:12db1b22-8d5c-482f-a91b-00021258a388][Vega]], in charge of the research project, made this statement: 

“These vital materials will allow us to establish a framework for how the region can expand. Thank you to everyone who has helped to chart a roadmap for [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]]’s future.” 

Pilots who contributed to the project can now collect their rewards from Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.
