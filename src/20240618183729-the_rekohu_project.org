* The Rekohu Project

/20 Apr 3304/

Angeli Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire’s key suppliers of foodstuffs and other consumables, has announced plans to build a Bowman-class science vessel. 

The construction initiative, dubbed the Rekohu Project, will allow the organisation to increase the biodiversity of its crops. Once complete, the megaship will be deployed to the PLAA AIN Sector to research life on Earth-like worlds. 

The organisation’s spokesperson, Commander Blain Crighton, released the following statement: 

“For a civilisation with near-limitless energy and the ability to cross the stars in the blink of an eye, how is it that we still have systems experiencing famine? The Rekohu Project is an effort to change that, and to find new ways to keep even the poorest fed.” 

In support of this goal, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed an open order for various commodities, promising to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Kanai Enterprise in the Blido Piru system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering goods to the starport can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 19th of April 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
