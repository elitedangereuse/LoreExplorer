* 0706 Distant Stars Expedition 3303
[[id:a58fae59-706b-44a8-a3a5-a3b43d1481de][Outotch SA-U D4-0]]

This system is famed as the jumping off point where many brave pilots
of the Distant Stars Expedition 3303 made their final jump to [[id:700bb597-7bee-49ad-bb07-946f1a52bd76][HD 76133]]
system.

This expedition was a collaborative journey to reach and explore a
previously unreachable region of space. These courageous souls knew
that this would be a one way trip and yet did not hesitate to make the
journey to discover what lay beyond this previously unreachable
frontier.

We salute the pilots of the Distant Stars Expedition and those that
supported them in their
efforts.
