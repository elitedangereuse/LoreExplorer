* Vodel Purchased by Core Dynamics

/19 Apr 3305/

Vodel is a familiar name to many, the independent company having cornered the market in personal land vehicles in recent years. But according to [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]], a downturn in profits has led to the company being purchased by Core Dynamics, a giant in the field of starship manufacture. 

Core Dynamics CEO [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]] gave the following statement to [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“There’s no question that the Vodel team possesses considerable expertise, and I’m delighted that Core Dynamics was able to help them in their hour of need.” 

“Vodel’s core team of designers and engineers will remain in place under our roof, so consumers can rest easy – the Scarab they know and love will remain unchanged.” 

In a piece for Vox Galactica, business analyst Marlon Royce observed: 

“Core Dynamics was smart to keep the Vodel team intact, since they clearly know their stuff. It’s an excellent deal for both companies.”
