* A Retrospective of 3307 (Part One)

/28 Dec 3307/

The noted historian [[id:e13ec234-b603-4a29-870d-2b87410195ea][Sima Kalhana]] takes a look back at the turbulent events of the last year in a four-part series of articles. 

“The start of 3307 was a time of crisis. The rise of the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][Neo-Marlinist
Liberation Army]] (NMLA), the [[id:46536da8-abd4-461f-9bf9-b749d4fc25e1][Marlinist]] refugee crisis and increased
Empire-Federation tensions had brought a full-scale superpower war
closer, with renewed attacks from the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] increasing the
pressure.”

“All of this led to [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]]’s proposal of a diplomatic conference for all three superpower governments to work through their problems – the very first [[id:c19cec97-cb93-4049-be5d-1abcaa6023a5][Galactic Summit]]. Within weeks, [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] was selected as the neutral host for the conference. [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] scored another triumph by establishing the Marlinist Colonies for millions of political refugees who had fled from the Empire.” 

“In February came the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, accused of arranging Starship One’s destruction back in 3301. His paymaster was revealed as Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester, who wanted to replace Federal democracy with direct corporate rule.” 

“His breakaway faction Jupiter Division was defeated in battle and Rochester himself jailed for life. This also led to Core Dynamics’s acquisition of Lakon Spaceways being cancelled, leaving [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] to purchase a majority sharehold in the company.” 

“Key players on the political stage finally gathered when the Galactic Summit began in late February. The Sirius system hosted leaders from the Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent systems. Even pirate warlord [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] gatecrashed the event, causing controversy with his ‘crown of bones’ speech.” 

“It seemed for a while that the bickering between so many strong personalities might trigger a war rather than avert one. But gradually there was progress, with the possibility of a treaty to increase unity against the Thargoid threat. But before reaching this conclusion, the Galactic Summit was derailed by a threat from another source.” 

“Nine Martyrs – as named by the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] leader [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]] – was the largest terrorist attack in history. Hundreds of thousands were killed by starport bombings in nine systems, including the superpower capitals of Alioth, Achenar and Sol. This horrific tragedy ended the conference abruptly, but did give rise to some inter-power cooperation.” 

“A new agreement signed at the Galactic Summit allowed the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to be formed rapidly. Drawing on the superpowers’ security services and other organisations, its sole purpose was to hunt down and eliminate the NMLA, a task that would dominate the headlines for the rest of the year.”
