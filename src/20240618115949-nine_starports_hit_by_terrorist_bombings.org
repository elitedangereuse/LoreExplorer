* Nine Starports Hit by Terrorist Bombings

/11 Mar 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Explosions have struck starports across the Alliance, Empire and Federation in a coordinated bombing attack by the NMLA. 

The capital systems of all three superpowers – Achenar, Alioth and Sol – have been targeted by the terrorists, as well as six other high-population systems. Precise casualty numbers are unavailable, but several hundred thousand people have been killed with many more injured. 

There are urgent calls for independent pilots to rescue survivors and support repair operations at all nine locations: 

Dawes Hub in the Achenar system 

Donaldson in the Alioth system 

Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system 

Hahn Gateway in the Nanomam system 

Ito Orbital in the Rhea system 

Lave Station in the Lave system 

Li Qing Jao in the Sol system 

Parkinson Dock in the Eotienses system 

Shajn Market in the Kamadhenu system 

The explosive damage to each station is consistent with corrosive enzyme weapons previously used by the NMLA. This has triggered automated systems designed to respond to Thargoid assaults. 

The [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]], Federal Navy and Imperial Navy are on full alert. Other military and security forces across the core systems are preparing for possible further attacks. 

The Galactic Summit has been temporarily suspended while Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders respond to the emergency. A full lockdown is in effect in the Sirius system, where the scheduled bounty hunting and trade initiatives have been cancelled.
