Meet the Powers – [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] 
 
Sirius Gov CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] is the focus of this seventh article from political commentator Marcus Macmillan about the movers and shakers in 3301. 

In this week’s historical article from [[id:e13ec234-b603-4a29-870d-2b87410195ea][Sima Kalhana]], she wrote about the founding of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. The Li dynasty’s involvement with the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]]ration can be traced back to the company’s founding almost 800 years ago. 

By the age of 25, Yong-Rui had earned doctorates in physics, politics and economics. He was hired by [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] straight from college. He then quickly made his way up the ranks, and at the tender age of 35, Yong-Rui was made Vice President of Forecasting. 

He has a proven track record in business, but has also demonstrated significant insight in the fuzzier elements and in particular how to provide effective government. With these skills he was considered the ideal candidate for [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]’s new Sirius Gov division.
