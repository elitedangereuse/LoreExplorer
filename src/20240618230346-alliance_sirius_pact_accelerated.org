* Alliance-Sirius Pact Accelerated

/15 Aug 3308/

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] and [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] have issued a joint statement regarding territorial defence against the Thargoids. 

“The recent tragedy in [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] has underscored the crucial importance of the strategic defence pact. As the likelihood of increased Thargoid aggression rises, Allied systems can be assured that we are making rapid changes to withstand this potential threat.” 

“Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]] will now coordinate all anti-xeno military operations. His first priority is to update the existing infrastructure of the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]], allowing member system fleets to form according to mission parameters. This will bring greater flexibility and allow the ADF to direct forces to anywhere Thargoid incursions occur.” 

“Allied worlds are calling out for greater defences, and the absence of a dedicated Alliance Navy has never been felt so keenly. But the Assembly is willing to approve greater military spending, and [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] stands ready to put the defence pact into practice.” 

In related news, the Council of Admirals officially verified that the Oath of Tyndareus was lost with all hands during the Thargoid counter-attack in the [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] system. The megaship’s crew have been posthumously honoured in a public ceremony.
