Federal and Imperial Diplomats Discuss the Pegasi Sector 
 
Historically, areas of mutual interest have resulting in cooperation between the Empire and the Federation. Now it seems that the humanitarian crisis in the Pegasi Sector represents one such mutual interest. 

In a meeting between Federation and Imperial commanders, Commander Nyluss of the Merchant Marines offered these words: "We must re-establish liberty in those zones that have become lawless. The Kumo Crew and its vagabond leader will no longer be tolerated in our space. I call upon all Federation pilots. How can you tolerate this encroachment upon our worlds?” 

Commander Corrigendum of Lavigny’s Legion added: “We welcome all those who want to oppose the tyranny of [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]], and ask that Federation and Imperial commanders operating in the Pegasi sector give one another a wide berth as they work toward the common goal of bringing Delaine to justice."
