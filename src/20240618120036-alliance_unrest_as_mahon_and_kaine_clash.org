* Alliance Unrest as Mahon and Kaine Clash

/17 May 3307/

The front-runner candidates in the Alliance election have stepped up their campaigns, amid widespread political and civil unrest. 

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] and Councillor Nakato Kaine are touring across the Alliance, gathering public support to sway the Assembly when it votes on the 27th of May. 

Attending a business sector conference on the planet Industry in the Zaonce system, Prime Minister Mahon stated: 

“We’ve heard a lot of reactionary rhetoric from Councillor Kaine, but it’s much easier to be critical than constructive. She has done little to secure the prosperity of our people and companies, which was my primary focus over the last six years.” 

At a protest march on New Caledonia in the Alkaid system, Councillor Kaine addressed the crowd: 

“Again, the Thargoids lash out at our presence. Again, we prop up the other superpowers. Again, we pump money into Aegis and Lakon but not our own economies. Nothing changes, unless Mahon is voted out and the Alliance takes a new direction!” 

Opinion polls suggest that Mahon has retained majority support, but with a narrower margin than in February when the election was originally scheduled. Many agree with Kaine that the Alliance should not have participated in the Galactic Summit, which led to the ‘Nine Martyrs’ bombings.
