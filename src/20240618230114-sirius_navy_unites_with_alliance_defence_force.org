* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Navy Unites with [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]]

/10 Jan 3308/

A new member has been appointed to the [[id:b0b347ac-10b8-4190-8787-1557f7d4a6da][Council of Admirals]] to
represent [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] as the Alliance’s strategic defence
partner.

Political correspondent [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] reported for [[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][The Alliance
Tribune]]:

“There are always six seats on the [[id:b0b347ac-10b8-4190-8787-1557f7d4a6da][Council of Admirals]], taken by
senior military commanders from the largest regional fleets. Not only
is this the first time that a seventh position has been created, it’s
also the first to come from outside the Alliance.”

“The new addition is Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], a highly decorated officer
with the [[id:3dd2f3c7-3ddf-4900-aa28-580344edd509][Sirius Navy]]. His new role is to coordinate the Alliance’s
[[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][anti-Thargoid]] operations, which from now on will be directly supported
by [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]].”

“[[id:7361b97b-004a-4243-920c-d0e8d93479b0][Prime Minister]] [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] and Fleet Admiral [[id:0ec5a134-7f81-4e70-b3e3-d502e7004530][Hayley Sorokin]] both
endorsed this development as a way of strengthening the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance
Defence Force]], which lacks the might of the [[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Federal]] or [[id:e9becd28-9644-42aa-afc8-7bba3ce10076][Imperial
Navy]]. Many member systems have demanded increased protection against
the Thargoid [[id:795b4989-8f5b-4560-a7aa-98ee12a4a06b][threat]], so this news is likely to be well received.”

“As expected, Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] opposed the defence pact, with
Admiral [[id:c51f8115-13d1-4d47-a88a-a126cd66d194][George Varma]] also critical of ‘merging commercial interests
with military matters’. [[id:d6cb8048-0ba6-42ff-84bf-8235a6f85503][Deputy Prime Minister]] [[id:82f88fe3-91eb-4e78-824e-ec809cb81ea9][Angela Corcoran]] also
admitted that she abstained during the recent joint vote, but chose
not to elaborate on her reasons. So it seems that the [[id:48ac5ad9-dd0e-4d43-a109-f4cf6d3efdea][Assembly]] is not
fully confident about this union with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]].”
