*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Utopia’s campaign in the Polevnic system has ended, with [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] announcing that it did not receive the desired quota of goods and samples. 

The requested deliveries of several types of commodities and encoded materials arrived at Tanner Settlement starport in the Polevnic system. The Guardians of Harmony, which managed the initiative, is now arranging payment on behalf of Antal for all pilots who took part. 

Simguru [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] transmitted a short message that was broadcast by all newsfeeds: 

“These limited materials will be put to good use, so I’d like to thank those pilots who sought to assist our ongoing work for the betterment of all. It would appear [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] maintains its shadow over humanity, even as Achilles’ Corporation enjoys a brief moment in the sunlight.” 

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], offered a response to claims of exerting pressure on Utopia: 

“If [[id:05ab22a7-9952-49a3-bdc0-45094cdaff6a][Pranav Antal]] is unable to maintain his carefully protected courier network, which provides vital resources for the Sim Archive, then [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] is perfectly capable of fulfilling any requests. Utopia's excellent research could benefit humanity in the present, not just some hypothetical future. My role as a representative of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]]ration’s many shareholders demands that I seek profit and potential in all areas of colonised space. Utopia is no different, and I look forward to discussing more with Pranav in person.” 

Participants can now collect their rewards from Tanner Settlement.
