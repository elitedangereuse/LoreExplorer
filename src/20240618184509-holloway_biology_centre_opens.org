* Holloway Biology Centre Opens

/11 Dec 3305/

Following months of setbacks, the Holloway Biology Centre has finally
opened in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] system. The research centre will focus on the
study of newly catalogued [[id:01ddb7a3-3a00-4fa6-b3b0-7dcdf01be1b2][lifeforms]].

Dr [[id:d5ca99a6-ded7-43fb-bc1e-83a622b49c50][Roy Casimir]], chief researcher at the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]],
held a press conference at the opening ceremony, and discussed the
delays that followed a successful campaign to found the centre in
February this year:

“Our study of the lifeforms discovered over the past year formed the
basis of the research centre’s designs. As the volume of scans
provided by the galactic community continued to grow, it became
apparent that we lacked the laboratory space required to study it
all.”

“As a result, the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] committed to several
months of investment and redesign, to ensure that a wide variety of
material could be analysed. We are confident that this decision will
prove more than worthwhile, and our scientists are excited to work in
this state-of-the-art facility.”

The Holloway Biology Centre is located in the Colonia system on [[id:d64c384b-5e85-44ef-ae31-a11e9577ce5f][Colonia 7 G]].
