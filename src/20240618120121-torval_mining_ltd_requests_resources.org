* Torval Mining Ltd Requests Resources

/21 Oct 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Senator Zemina Torval’s new corporation requires deliveries of commodities to its megaship in the EGM 559 system. 

Constantia Torval, the senator’s daughter and operations director of the company, provided details of the initiative: 

“Now that we are a fully independent business, additional resources are urgently needed to continue providing services to the Empire. My goal is to ensure that the Torval name remains synonymous with efficiency and dedication.” 

“Shipments of geological equipment, microbial furnaces and mineral extractors can be delivered to the megaship Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system. From there, they will be transferred to our headquarters at Torval Orbital in LTT 198.” 

The Pride of Bitterwood is part of a corporate fleet recently purchased by Torval Mining Ltd. Most are currently in the LTT 198 system being outfitted for mining and transport operations. Business analysts believe that these megaships were funded by [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] after selling the majority of her shares in Mastopolos Mining.
