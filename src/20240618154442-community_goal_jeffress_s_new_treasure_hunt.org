* Community Goal: Jeffress's New Treasure Hunt

/24 Mar 3302/

Following a long hiatus, reclusive philanthropist Alfred Jeffress has announced a new treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner. 

In a statement, Jeffress confirmed that the event will follow the same format as his previous treasure hunts. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find it and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will set participants on the path to finding the mystery object: 

"The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in her steps." 

With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.
