[[id:4a969d51-8e07-46dc-b0bc-19e007d21c9d][Omega Sector VE-Q B5-15]]

[[id:f176c68d-cc7a-4db2-8305-81f6771c7e9f][Distant Worlds II]] was an ambitious five-month expedition to the far
outer rim. It launched from the [[id:4ccdf1db-68db-4935-8cac-b6d23e01d78d][Pallaeni]] system in January 3305 and
reached its final destination of [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]] in May 3305. The purpose
of the expedition was to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, and to
construct a starport at [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]].

The beacon marks the location where the bulk of materials for the
[[id:1c6bdbbd-527a-4533-abac-81eade19c059][Explorer's Anchorage]] starport were mined.
