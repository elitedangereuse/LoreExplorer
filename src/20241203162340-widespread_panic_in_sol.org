* Widespread Panic in Sol

/02 Dec 3310/

Confirmation that the final [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Thargoid Titan]], [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]], is headed for the
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] system has sparked mass panic among inhabitants.

Evacuation efforts in [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] began as a precaution on November 28th, when
[[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] first moved towards the core systems. Once it became
clear that [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] was on a direct course for [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]], these efforts were
swiftly accelerated.

Defence Secretary [[id:a95edcc6-f406-49e5-898c-cdeb3f07cab6][Conn Montgomery]] provided the following update to the
[[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][Federal Times]]:

“Rescue Ship [[id:f280d482-d125-4f1e-abbc-cd04f1a8c3f3][Cornwallis]] is acting as our delivery point for most
refugees who do not have access to spacecraft. We’re shuttling
civilians from [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]] to ports within [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] for transport by Federal
military craft and freelance pilots. Other [[id:182c575c-e759-4f7e-ad38-cf8424926490][rescue megaships]] are
scheduled for arrival in the next few days to systems close to [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]],
which will increase our capacity to process refugees and deliver them
to temporary holdings in neighbouring systems.”

“We ask for the people of [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] to pack lightly, move to your nearest
designated evacuation centre and follow all instructions from Federal
authorities. This is an extremely complicated operation, with over 22
billion people in the system that need to be kept safe. The Federation
is doing everything it can to prepare for [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Titan]] [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]’s arrival.”

News of [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]’s approach has triggered significant alarm across
[[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]], [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] and major ports. Riots have occurred at evacuation centres
as people clamour to be transported out of the system. There have been
two separate attempts to storm a secure medical facility on [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]] where
citizens rescued from Thargoid abductions are housed, with gathered
crowds blaming the abductees for ‘summoning’ [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]] to [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]. To date,
there is no evidence to support such claims.

[[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE-cast]] analysts have also noted an increase in online hostility
towards [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]], the [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] special advisor who recently declared
her unique link to the Thargoid [[id:cf8efef4-6db7-4780-9b79-6321b738adfc][hive]] mind was ‘exploited’ for
information. Some prominent political [[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE-casters]] have blamed her for
providing the Thargoids with the location of humanity’s original home
world, [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]].
