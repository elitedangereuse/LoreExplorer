Aisling Duval Reviews her Security 
 
The personal security for Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] is under review as yet another private conversation has been leaked to the press. Considering the content of the leaked recording some commentators have suggested that the princess would be better served by being more circumspect in what she says. 

Much of the audio is undistinguishable but at one stage Aisling can be heard saying: 

“Denton would never do something like this. He’s far too up tight and strait-laced. Besides, he’s a nobody now. That Lavigny bitch – she’ll get the sympathy vote from this and she knows it.” 

A spokeswoman for Princess Duval stated: 

“This is clearly a fake intended to discredit the princess. To think that someone would stoop to this type of low politics in our time of grief is repulsive.”
