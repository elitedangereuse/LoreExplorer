* Recover Escape Pods in Meene

/08 Nov 3304/

Following a skirmish with a group of mercenaries, security forces in the Meene system have launched an operation to capture enemy agents in order to investigate the attack. 

Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force gave the following statement: 

“The mercenaries were targeting [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]’s Phoenix Base, but it’s clear they were just hired hands. We need to recover as many surviving mercenaries as we can and interrogate them, so we can find the real culprits.” 

The Independent HIP 29241 Green Party, which is overseeing the initiative, has asked pilots to recover both occupied and damaged escape pods, and to deliver them to Felice Dock in the Meene system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing to the recovery can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 8th of November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
