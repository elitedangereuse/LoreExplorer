* Hadrian Duval Seeks Reintegration with the Empire

/10 Nov 3306/

Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval has recovered from an assassination attempt and signalled a new direction for Nova Imperium. 

Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] provided advanced medical care for Imperator Duval after a near-fatal attack by [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] assassins. Following a period of discussion, she told the media:  

“At this time of crisis we need allies more than ever, and my cousin’s royal heritage should not be denied. I have therefore formally requested sovereign consent for him to be accepted into the Imperial Family as Prince Hadrian.” 

Hadrian Duval broadcast this message from Dyson City: 

“I owe my life to Aisling, but life without purpose means nothing, and the Duvals’ purpose has always been to protect the Empire. I seek to adopt my birthright and help defend our traditional ways of life.” 

“However, many of us see disturbing parallels between the brutal purge of Nova Imperium’s followers in 3305 and the current crusade against the Marlinists. I call upon those in power not to repeat this mistake – the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] is the common enemy we must unite against.” 

Many senators publicly agreed that the Empire must heal past divisions to focus on the Neo-Marlinist threat. Others have voiced concerns at the repercussions of Emperor Hengist’s illegitimate grandson becoming an heir to the throne. As yet, Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] has not responded.
