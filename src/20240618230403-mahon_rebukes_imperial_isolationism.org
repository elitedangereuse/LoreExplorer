* Mahon Rebukes Imperial Isolationism

/07 Sep 3308/

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has spoken out against Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]]’s decree to suspend inter-superpower cooperation. 

At a meeting of the Alliance Assembly, Mahon said: 

“This hasty decision from Emperor Arissa will have dangerous repercussions for the core systems as a whole, not just those within the Empire. Now that the Thargoids have become more hostile than ever before, humanity should be uniting against this common enemy.” 

“Let us not forget: the coalition of anti-xeno taskforces in [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] performed their duties admirably, despite the tragic conclusion. That degree of military coordination could and should be sustained, to a far broader scale.” 

“The [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Treaty, which I proposed at the Galactic Summit in 3307, would have established anti-xeno operations as a cross-superpower priority. I can only imagine how much better prepared we would now be to combat the Thargoids. But there is still scope for governments and organisations to work more closely, as exemplified by our strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation.” 

The Alliance, Federation and Marlinist Colonies have reported that the Empire is methodically closing down all collaborative projects. However, official diplomatic representation in non-Imperial territories has been maintained.
