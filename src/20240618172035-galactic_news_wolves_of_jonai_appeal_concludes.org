* Galactic News: Wolves of Jonai Appeal Concludes

/17 Nov 3303/

The Central Command of the Wolves of Jonai has announced that its campaign to build an asteroid base among the rings of HR 7047 2 C has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering construction materials to Grant Dock, and by eliminating agitators in the HR 7047 system. 

A spokesperson for the Wolves of Jonai released the following statement: 

“Thanks to the Commanders who contributed materials to the Wolves of Jonai, the construction of our new asteroid base is now assured. Central Command extends its thanks to the pilots involved.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Grant Dock in the HR 7047 system.
