* 0673 Patreus Rails Against London Treaty
[[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]]  

On October 21st 3303 Admiral [[id:f4ab6958-497d-430c-b322-bc5c67aa7707][Denton Patreus]] spoke in strident tones
about the [[id:28dc6fa3-20a3-49ab-a362-7e02fe73ee61][London Treaty]]. The treaty, established in 3278, imposes
limits on capital-ship construction in order to prevent possible arms
races.

"This treaty was foisted on us by overzealous Federal lawyers," said
Patreus. "Now it is used to limit our ability to defend
ourselves. This I cannot accept."

"I am proud to announce that henceforth the Empire will build as many
ships as it needs, treaty restrictions be damned!"
