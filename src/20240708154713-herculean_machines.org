Founded in 3299 by [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]], Herculean Machines stands as testament
to the power of a good family name. Son of haulage magnate Rhesus Hurd,
Hurd junior founded Herculean Machines as a means of escaping
conscription into the family business. Tapping the family trust for
capital, Hurd hired graduates from the galaxy's top engineering programs
with promise of being more than just "a megacorp drone."

Within three months of founding, Herculean had already registered
patents in all three superpower jurisdictions. Using his family's
contacts to secure materials at low prices, Hurd kept production costs
down and the focus of his products simple. Whereas competitors spent
billions on glossy design, Herculean was concerned almost exclusively
with performance.

Rapid growth followed, with a fresh round of funding allowing Herculean
to open two more development facilities. Meanwhile, [[id:93fd6de1-43a9-40e8-819f-43d9bcd3a709][Maddox Hurd]] was
earning a reputation as a bellicose businessman, known for browbeating
opponents and driving employees to breaking point. Reports began
circulating of severely overworked engineers, with news outlets
publishing accounts from anonymous whistle-blowers.

Hurd dismissed the reports as anti-Herculean propaganda, but a short
time later, a disgruntled employee leaked prototype sketches detailing
Herculean's upcoming device, the Duradrive.

The leak was met with scathing criticism from [[id:b62c9e2e-8079-44bc-a30d-d192076162e6][Scorpio DeVorrow]], CEO of
rival company Supratech. DeVorrow decried the Duradrive as a regressive
analogue; Hurd struck back, describing DeVorrow as "a pompous fool with
impractical ideas."

With that exchange the dam was broken, both CEOs engaging in
increasingly vitriolic public dialogue until the 3304 Rackham Ultratech
Expo, when their companies debuted new devices. Herculean won the bout,
however, when the Duradrive proved more popular with consumers, its
inelegant design notwithstanding.

Herculean's success was compounded when the Federal Navy placed a
wholesale order for the Duradrive, making the device standard issue for
its soldiers. The revenue generated from the contract has given the
corporation a near-unassailable position in the tech-company landscape.
