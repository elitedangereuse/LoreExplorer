* Galactic News: Otto Granger Demands Credit

/09 Sep 3302/

Otto Granger, the smuggler who involved the galactic community in an elaborate search for the mysterious debris in the Pleiades Nebula, has demanded that he receive credit for the discovery. 

In an interview with The Federal Times, Granger made his feelings clear: 

"Look, I admit it – when we found the wreck, we saw it as an opportunity to make some money. But we never planned to keep the discovery from the public." 

"The point is that we found it – me and my friends. But now the discovery has been credited to someone else! It's outrageous!" 

Commentators have been quick to point out that Granger's efforts to profit from the discovery, and his reluctance to share it with the galactic community in a spirit of altruism, are sufficient grounds to deny him credit.
