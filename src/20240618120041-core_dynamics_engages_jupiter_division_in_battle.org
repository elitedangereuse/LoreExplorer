* [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] Engages [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] in Battle

/03 Jun 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The corporate faction [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] is fighting for survival against the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system. 

Jupiter Division was formed by rogue [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] departments loyal to ex-CEO [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]]. Although it was defeated in February, a growing corporatist movement within the Federation has helped rebuild its strength. 

A call to arms was made by [[id:167df18a-99f8-4279-bc55-a736f6af44c2][Owen McKenna]], the new CEO of [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]]: 

“Rochester’s deranged cult must be wiped out once and for all. We are supporting our ally, the Silver Legal Group, to destroy [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]]’s fleet and allow us to retake our stolen resources.” 

Vice-Executive Blanca Carbonell, a senior leader of [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]], broadcast this message: 

“To all those seeking a better Federation – stand up and make your voice heard! Only direct corporate rule can end government corruption. [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] must survive to lead that change!” 

Two megaships, Victory’s Forge and Iron Wings of Justice, are once again serving as the centres of operation for [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] and the Silver Legal Group.  

Political commentators believe that this second conflict will be a decisive one, determining whether or not [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] can survive without its founder.
