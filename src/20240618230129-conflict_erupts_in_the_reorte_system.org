* Conflict Erupts in the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] System

/27 Jan 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition has declared its intent to remove the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation presence from its home system. 

The megaship Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] arrived in [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] as part of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation’s new role as the Alliance’s strategic defence partner. But the system’s controlling faction ordered it to withdraw. The megaship’s non-compliance has resulted in skirmishes targeting Sirius forces. 

Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition, announced: 

“We fully support Councillor Kaine’s position that [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation is operating illegally under Alliance law. Therefore, we will defend our territory from this aggressive foreign entity.” 

A response was broadcast by Captain Delfina Dominguez of the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Navy, who commands the Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]]: 

“Our presence is authorised by the military contract between [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation and the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]]. If local forces continue to attack, we will have no option but to defend our assets.” 

The fighting is not believed to have reached surface level and is expected to remain a ship-based conflict. 

To rally support from independent pilots, both factions are offering access to permit-locked systems. [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition will sponsor distribution of an [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system permit, while [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation will authorise a permit to the Sirius system. 

Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has ordered the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition to cease hostilities immediately. However, Councillor Ainsley Niven  – who represents Reorte in the Assembly and is a political supporter of [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] – claims that the faction has the right to protect its territory, since it was not invited to ratify the defence pact.
