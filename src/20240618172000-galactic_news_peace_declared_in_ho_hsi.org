Authorities in the Ho Hsi system have confirmed that the conflict between Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited and the Freedom Party of Ho Hsi has come to an end. 

Ho Hsi media outlets have reported that the battle was won by Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited. The Freedom Party of Ho Hsi is understood to have withdrawn its forces. 

Both factions received support from independent combat pilots, to whom generous rewards were promised, but ultimately it was Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited that emerged victorious.  

A spokesperson for Ho Hsi Jet Comms Limited issued a statement to those who rallied to their cause: 

“Without your help, the Freedom Party of Ho Hsi might have got the better of us. We’ll never forget it.”
