* [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] Wreak Havoc in Core Systems

/18 Apr 3305/

It has now been more than two months since the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] began a
concentrated assault on the core systems, and in that time they have
attacked dozens of starports, resulting in thousands of casualties.

As authorities in the affected systems continue to appeal for aid,
Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]], [[id:a6b33331-c1bb-44cf-9717-f72eb0f63c99][Aegis]]’s chief military liaison, has offered the
following assessment:

“What’s surprising is that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] aren’t targeting our most
important social or military centres, such as the superpowers’ home
systems. There’s no doubt that they’re trying to weaken us, but
evidently they’re guided by different principles than those that
typically govern human martial strategy.”

“What we can say is this: with capital ships of limited use against
Thargoid craft, independent combat pilots remain our best defence
against the Thargoids.”
