* 0211 Competition from [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]]
[[id:a17c479c-5ee8-42c1-8fee-22cbf1407db9][Epsilon Eridani]]

[[id:ebaea4eb-8ba1-4f48-ada6-ca694704143b][WorldCraft]] is a giant Corporation, but still has very high debt levels
due to the acquisition, and has been seen to be quite unscrupulous in
many of its dealings. This has since damaged the WorldCraft brand
somewhat, and is not so warmly embraced by the Empire as a result
(though some Imperial worlds still have Worldcraft atmospheric
processors built by [[id:26ebe1e0-4c30-4317-8e20-16634efcab49][FMV]], but now served by WorldCraft in an uneasy
relationship). This made way for the creation of [[id:c85d1251-b6f2-460f-9a24-b1aba6b14097][Sirius Atmospherics]] -
that has since taken a big slice of the terraforming business from
WorldCraft - which WorldCraft has been powerless to stop as they
remain a big customer of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] as at the core of their terraforming
units is a 100GW [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] power plant.

WorldCraft operates two major business areas; terraforming and
tourism/entertainment, making them a direct competitor to the
[[id:a7056ff8-e67d-4ca9-baf1-7e5df3efa677][Rockforth Corporation]] in one and [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] in the other.
