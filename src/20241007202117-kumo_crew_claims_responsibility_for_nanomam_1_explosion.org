* Kumo Crew Claims Responsibility for Nanomam 1 Explosion

/22 Aug 3310/

An explosion outside the Federal Republican Party offices on Nanomam 1 has claimed the lives of three government workers. 

The blast originated from a small shuttle waiting to collect Shadow President-elect Jerome Archer, who had spent the morning at the building on party business. Archer was reportedly approaching the vehicle at the time of the explosion but was unharmed. 

While security services hunted for evidence among the wreckage, a public announcement from Archon Delaine quickly claimed responsibility: 

“All the surveillance technology in the galaxy could not prevent the Kumo Crew from reaching Jerome Archer’s personal vehicle. Only by our generosity does he live to learn from this event. He wraps himself in the cloak of the police state, blind to the real danger to people like him: complacency.” 

“As the Emperor recently discovered, all the wealth and titles humanity has to offer provide little protection when faced with reality. Their deaths would mean less than the message: even if the Thargoid war is won, there are dangers waiting for you all that have been ignored for too long.” 

Media commentators have speculated that this statement also claims responsibility for the attempted ambush of Emperor Arissa’s convoy earlier this month. A short response from an Imperial Senate spokesperson has dismissed such talk, saying that Delaine was ‘nothing more than a self-aggrandising pirate eager for the spotlight.’ 

This latest incident highlights growing concerns that the core systems face a significant period of post-Thargoid invasion uncertainty. Pressing concerns include a cooled economic climate, widespread population movements and significant military spending by all superpowers.
