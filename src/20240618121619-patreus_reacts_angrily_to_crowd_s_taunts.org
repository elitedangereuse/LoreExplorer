Patreus Reacts Angrily to Crowd’s Taunts 
 
Some elements of the lower-level Imperial political scene have challenged Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] to explain his connection to Brendan Paul Darius, the assassin responsible for the murder of the Emperor during the wedding ceremony with Florence Lavigny. Since the revelation of the assassin’s identity the senator has steadfastly refused to comment, but responded angrily to accusations from a vocal minority in the crowd outside the senate.  

“The notion that I might somehow be linked with the murder of our most loved Emperor is offensive. It does bring dishonour and shame upon me that a man in my employ could perform such a heinous act, but it was certainly done without my knowledge. The thought that I allowed such a man near his august presence torments me.” 

He also added that the full resources of his office were being made available to the officers in the investigation and that he would aid them in any way he could. 

More responsible commentators agree that the accusations are ridiculous. Speculation remains however as to why the man killed the Emperor and whether he was acting alone or for another party.
