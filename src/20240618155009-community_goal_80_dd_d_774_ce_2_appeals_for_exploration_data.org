* Community Goal: 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 Appeals for Exploration Data

/25 Aug 3302/

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction, an independent organisation based at [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] system, has issued a request for exploration data. The request is part of an ongoing initiative to establish a permanent community in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula. 

A spokesperson for 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 released the following statement: 

"If we're going to settle in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula then we need to know more about it, which is why we're currently offering highly competitive rates for exploration data. After all, pilots will be making the trek out to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] anyway â€“ might as well make some credits en route." 

80 DD-D 774-CE-2 has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] system. The campaign begins on the 25th of August 3302 and will run for four weeks.
