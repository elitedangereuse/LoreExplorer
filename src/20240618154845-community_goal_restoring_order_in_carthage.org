* Community Goal: Restoring Order in Carthage

/21 Jul 3302/

Authorities in the Carthage system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. To ensure these agitators do not disrupt the Lavigny's Legion campaign, a kill order has been placed on all wanted ships operating in the system. Lavigny's Legion has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Marker Depot. 

The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
