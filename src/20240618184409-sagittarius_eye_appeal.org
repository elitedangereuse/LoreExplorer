* Sagittarius Eye Appeal

/06 Jun 3305/

Sagittarius Eye has announced plans to construct an asteroid station in the Millese system.  

A spokesperson for the faction provided the following statement:  

â€œWe've found a lovely asteroid in Millese that we can hollow out to build our print works in. We don't have a great deal of experience with building, but our intern has an engineering degree and tells us that we'll need specific materials. Bring us those and we'll reward you handsomely!" 

In support of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order for cobalt, titanium and tantalum, with rewards available to pilots who deliver these commodities to McMullen Ring in the Millese system. 

The campaign will take place between the 6th and 12th of June 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
