* 0213 WorldCraft Theme Park
[[id:a17c479c-5ee8-42c1-8fee-22cbf1407db9][Epsilon Eridani]]

Most come here for the [[id:bc224d86-f50a-4250-b8b6-1185f20d887d][WorldCraft Theme Park]] which was set up with no
expense spared and costs s small fotrune to visit. It is well worth it
though, because you can live in a world of almost any fantasy you wish
(something that has given it a reputation for seediness). If you want
a break from the lushness outside, you can elect to stay for a day at
the [[id:5916109c-9823-4b81-87d7-2a36dc4175f5][Ancient London Earth World]] of 1960 (where every effort has been
made to make it as authentic as possible, it even has the stench of
pollution).

Every fantasy theme has its own complex which is self contained, with
actors to help tourists play a part in adventures and feel that it is
real.

There are more wholesome themes on offer too. The [[id:56f7dbf9-8960-4b12-b66e-ec45b6a79f99][War Veterans Trust]]
maintains offices at Oliverport and runs the famous [[id:4d244265-1d5d-4e53-a9a2-2b52dcb815a9][Museum of Armour
and Ballistics]] on [[id:47df3d18-6cdd-443d-baae-0e3af142a089][New California]].
