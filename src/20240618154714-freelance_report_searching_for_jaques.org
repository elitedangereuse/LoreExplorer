* Freelance Report: Searching for [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]

/17 Jun 3302/

It is almost a month since [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] departed from [[id:ab3ea80d-bf90-482c-bcf1-63f1d2f1b21f][Gliese 1269]] to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle
Point]] in his specially modified [[id:d5cc8c3e-9887-4c30-9a1d-08008ab36675][Orbis]] Starport. Pilots from the
[[id:dbb9956e-5ae2-4c27-94f7-670f0a4719f9][Distant Worlds]] Expedition and the FGE exploration wings have been
eagerly awaiting [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]'s arrival.

Jaques's travel time was originally predicted to be about one week,
but this time passed with no sign of the space station. Many pilots
remained hopeful that [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] would arrive in time for the end of the
Distant Worlds Expedition on the 5th of June, but the closing ceremony
was conducted without him.

With the expedition over, anxiety started to take hold of the
remaining pilots. Many were depending on [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] to replenish supplies
and make essential repairs for their onward journeys.

Fearing that the starport might have suffered an accident, searches of
planets in the Beagle Point region were organised, led by Commander
[[id:f490fe9c-c386-4775-8aa6-a88e91a6aa81]['Erimus' Kamzel]]. On the 12th of June, almost twenty pilots conducted
an intensive search around the base camp on [[id:9d9092b2-23f3-4ef5-9982-f61e0b123bcf][Darwin's Legacy]], covering
nearly 20,000 square kilometres, but no sign of the spaceport was
found.

The search took place in almost total darkness, at low
altitude. Several ships and SRVs suffered damage, and one pilot ran
out of fuel, necessitating rescue by the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]]. With hope all but
lost and the risks to pilots becoming ever greater, the search was
reluctantly called off.
