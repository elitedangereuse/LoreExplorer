* Community Goal: The Rise to Power Continues

/07 Jul 3302/

The first stage of the Rise to Power campaign is over, and the second is about to begin. 

This phase of the competition will focus on what has been euphemistically referred to as commodity reallocation, with pilots being asked to gather as many technical blueprints as they can for their chosen faction. The only condition is that the technical blueprints be obtained unlawfully...which is to say stolen. The group with the most technical blueprints at the end of the event will be declared the winner. 

The Rise to Power competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players. 

The event begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week.
