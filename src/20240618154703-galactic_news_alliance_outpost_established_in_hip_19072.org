* Galactic News: Alliance Outpost Established in HIP 19072

/26 May 3302/

Last month, the Alliance launched an initiative to establish a new outpost on the fringes of inhabited space. The campaign received the support of hundreds of Alliance-aligned pilots who, along with other members of the galactic community, delivered essential materials and components to the Alliance base at Noti Dock. 

Now, Alliance Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] has announced that the new outpost is complete. In a statement, Mahon said: 

"It gives me great pleasure to announce the formal opening of the Cooper Research Centre. In addition to functioning as a base for scientific research, the station will bolster the Alliance's reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering capabilities in a strategically valuable region of space." 

An Alliance spokesperson confirmed that the new outpost would offer reload, repair and refuel services to pilots operating in the HIP 19072 system.
