* Carson’s Spring Reaches Arque System

/22 Jul 3305/

Carson’s Spring, the megaship transporting Professor Ishmael Palin from the Maia system, has successfully completed its journey, having endured a number of attacks by [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] craft. 

Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]] provided this update on behalf of Aegis Research: 

“With support from many independent combat pilots, the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] assaults on Carson’s Spring have been successfully repelled.” 

“The megaship has now arrived in the Arque system with Professor Palin and his staff.” 

Palin currently remains aboard Carson’s Spring. Efforts are underway to establish a new permanent home at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E, from where Palin’s previously offered engineering services can resume.
