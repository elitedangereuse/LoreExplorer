* Carson’s Spring Reaches [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] System

/22 Jul 3305/

Carson’s Spring, the megaship transporting Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] from the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system, has successfully completed its journey, having endured a number of attacks by Thargoid craft. 

Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]] provided this update on behalf of Aegis Research: 

“With support from many independent combat pilots, the Thargoid assaults on Carson’s Spring have been successfully repelled.” 

“The megaship has now arrived in the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system with Professor Palin and his staff.” 

Palin currently remains aboard Carson’s Spring. Efforts are underway to establish a new permanent home at Abel Laboratory on [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] 4 E, from where Palin’s previously offered engineering services can resume.
