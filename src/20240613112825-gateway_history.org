[[id:d4502696-2432-4f84-abb1-f3d124249805][Gateway]]

Gateway was originally known as Oltiqu, but renamed when the Alliance
was founded in 3230. The system had originally been under Federation
jurisdiction after being colonised in 2473 to be used as a military
staging area for a further invasion of [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]. Over time, the military
bases became more permanent colonies and settlements. The system
achievend full federal membership in 2561, but remained relatively
unimportant and in the shadow of [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] for many centuries.

When [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] finally achieved independence in 3230, Oltiqu might have
been a place where the Federation forces could rally and
return. However a coordinated peaceful coup by sympathetic federal
officials allowed the system to be united under the banner of the
Alliance.
