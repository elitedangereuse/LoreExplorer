* [[id:45d78e5d-27b7-48cb-97b2-012934be3180][Imperial Intelligence]] Denies NMLA Connection

/07 Jan 3308/

Senators have refuted [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]]’s claim that the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] made use of official but highly secret Imperial communications devices. 

Captain [[id:ccaf380d-14e8-4a1a-9458-8c3bad87b25c][Saskia Landau]] maintains that the terrorist group’s [[id:b58b26bb-8465-42a9-896c-4c0e97d20444][dark-comms]] network was very similar to the [[id:22dfd239-84ed-4b35-aa95-bc955ca95e8b][Omega Grid]], an undetectable messaging system used exclusively by [[id:45d78e5d-27b7-48cb-97b2-012934be3180][Imperial Intelligence]]. 

Senator Karl Nerva told the media: 

“In her desperation to seek out the NMLA, Captain Landau is chasing shadows. [[id:45d78e5d-27b7-48cb-97b2-012934be3180][Imperial Intelligence]] must operate under total secrecy, but I assure you that this ‘Omega Grid’ is just as much of an invention to discredit the Empire as Serene Harbour was.” 

“Landau has overstepped her authority with these outlandish accusations. I once again propose that [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]] be disbanded and its operatives returned to normal duties.” 

The Imperial Herald reported that other senators are calling for Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] to overrule those who are blocking [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]]’s investigation. The newsfeed highlighted that she did not attend any functions in person during the past year, and has not broadcast any public messages. 

In response, Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] gave this statement: 

“Her Majesty was placed under secure protection in early 3307 after several failed assassination attempts by the NMLA. She has been communicating remotely with the Senate on all official business, but does plan to return to Capitol very soon.”
