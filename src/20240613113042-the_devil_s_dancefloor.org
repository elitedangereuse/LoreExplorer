[[id:51ee0837-cac7-466c-a019-4743b891c1c8][Eeshorks BA-A G2179]]

The system was first discovered during a joint expedition by three
well known scientists in the field of gravitational physics: [[id:9f04a47e-a40a-4fd0-9ef0-eba5cd3d26d9][Grace
Gutierrez]], [[id:b6c2e4ae-5294-4cd3-bcce-1d7ad2ddb164][Rondall Hudon]], and [[id:1b7c6edb-caad-4a87-9c19-024250b895f7][Lennox McFadden]], back in July of 3303.

EESHORKS BA-A G2179 has researchers buzzing now that its discoverers
have gone public with details of the system. It contains a black hole
and four neutron stars, and is considered extra special by researchers
studying gravitational waves as four of the five bodies that make up
the system are organised into two sets of binaries orbiting each other
very closely. They orbit so closely that the AB pair orbit each other
in approximately two hours ([[id:e75a40cf-201c-4ae8-8e01-ad788787dc05][The Swing Couple]]), and the CD pair in five
hours ([[id:a215a950-c0b5-4b24-858d-5df41b14971e][The Waltz Couple]]), with both pairs orbiting each other in an
area less than 250Ls across.

The A star of the system is a black hole measuring 10.6 solar
masses. Bodies B, C and D are each microsecond [[id:b9728bff-08a9-48e8-bb6d-0362c76dc3d3][pulsars]] with spins
aligned by orbits so tight a ship may find itself in the ejecta cones
of both pulsars at the same time! The fifth and last body of the
system is another neutron star at a range of 342,000Ls which the
members of the discovering expedition refer to as "[[id:1445a785-ff06-4ab6-b828-eb9dc8c7d312][The Wallflower]]".
