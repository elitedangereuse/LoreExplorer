* A Profile of Jordan Rochester

/07 Jul 3304/

Responding to public interest in Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]’s fiancé,
Federal Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]], political journalist [[id:745efc38-c548-40c0-81d2-82973c604d37][Cassia
Carvalho]] has compiled a profile for [[id:626a18d7-ad16-4093-b9be-d9dc1940594b][The Imperial Herald]]:

“[[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] is now a household name throughout the Empire,
though few were aware of him prior to his engagement to [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Princess
Duval]]. But in the Federation, the [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochesters]] have been associated with
success for over two hundred years.”

“The Rochester name can be traced back to self-made tycoon [[id:dbde7c3d-771a-4162-965e-bc339bf4348b][Apollo
Rochester]], who was the biggest landowner on [[id:c85eebaa-df77-4a04-9a59-3fc005d95bb2][Biggs Colony]] in the [[id:144149ef-21cd-4e52-afea-dcf379d12d18][Altair]]
system. Each generation since has strived for fame and [[id:f45a004a-7a8e-4596-8515-cc3fa4b2845c][wealth]], and the
expression ‘as rich as a Rochester’ has become common parlance.”

“The family matriarch is [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]]. She is a member of
[[id:614fd344-ec09-483c-a28e-0289590946c4][Congress]], an influential figure in the [[id:4cfca8e0-b6a6-4e86-b777-4754f914fa3e][Liberal Party]] and a staunch
supporter of [[id:98a18cdb-c516-4c5c-8bd6-c8c4c707e991][Shadow President]] [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]]. [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde]] raised five
children, including [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan]], and it was her accomplishments that
inspired her son to enter politics.”

“Jordan’s siblings chose different paths. The eldest, [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter
Rochester]], is an executive with [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]], with a personal fortune
in the billions. Fifteen years ago he had his own celebrity marriage,
to actor [[id:f3e29df5-154d-4f05-b659-36fa2da9be01][Tomas Turai]]. They now have two teenage children, daughter
[[id:8d2d5396-49bf-45f7-8142-d4aa7975e381][Kali]] and son [[id:71fb46e1-ad53-47d6-b3a9-32d67e657605][Kalen]].”

“Jordan’s sisters, [[id:dcd15dc0-47b2-4d66-9232-f23e9cb3881b][Juno]] and [[id:b5d8f8e7-c265-4c37-bdb9-43d6ba78ce7f][Jocasta]], have impressive [[id:3d268496-1d95-49bc-aca6-49d16a4337c8][Navy]] careers,
holding the ranks of Vice Admiral and Post Captain respectively. Only
Jordan’s younger brother, [[id:57c0f043-0ce4-4e03-bf0f-7c751704aa6e][Jonah]], has no title. He is believed to be
the black sheep of the family.”

“Despite being just 34, Jordan has already made his mark. He has
overseen several high-level negotiations on behalf of the [[id:46ff5046-45e9-402d-93a3-96f9c1e508a3][Federal
Diplomatic Corps]] and is now a trusted envoy, noted for his charm and
tact.”

“His future will be interesting, to say the least. How will he balance
being both a Federal statesman and an Imperial consort? And what are
the wider ramifications of the [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochester]] dynasty aligning with the
House of [[id:bce02e51-c68c-4594-86fe-88dda4915a74][Duval]]? Even more so than his predecessors, [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]]
has already ensured that history will remember his family’s name.”
