* [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] Celebrations End as Election Begins

/12 Oct 3309/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Federation has begun voting to decide its next president, as a week of festivities in the [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] system are concluded. 

Congress confirmed that any pilots who supplied rare goods for the celebratory events can collect payment from Li Qing Jao starport. All temporary system permits for [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] remain suspended for Pilots’ Federation members for a further week. 

The 3309 presidential election has now officially begun. More than one trillion Federal citizens    are expected to submit their votes, which will be recorded and collated over the next four days via secure digital systems. 

Vice President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]] is the Republican Party candidate, who is widely perceived as the political heir to President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]]. His running mate is Congressman Niko Shirakawa, who has strong connections within the military. 

Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]], leader of the Liberal Party, is the rival candidate and a proponent of more humanitarian-focused policies. She is on a presidential ticket with Congressman [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]], matriarch of the famous Rochester dynasty. 

[[id:e660f840-caed-45ef-985e-f75170cf9ca8][Sofia Trevino]], political correspondent for [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]], commented: 

“Following months of delay, logistical issues caused by the Thargoid war, plus the drama surrounding [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]], voting is finally underway. Analysts believe this could be one of the closest-run elections in the Federation’s history, reflecting the polarisation that has taken place in recent years.”  

“Support for the Republican Party has been bolstered by its increasingly successful handling of the Thargoid menace during the past six months. But Archer’s flagship creation, the Proactive Detection Bureau, remains highly divisive – something the Liberal Party has found success in using to frame its opponent as increasingly authoritarian. How these primary points will ultimately impact the outcome of the vote remains to be seen.” 

The new president will be announced on Monday 16th October. President Hudson will remain in office as caretaker president until the official inauguration of the election winner, expected to take place in the new year.
