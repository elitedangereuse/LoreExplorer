* Dredger Deadlock Inspires Competing Campaigns

/18 Nov 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The HIP 43670 system is hosting two competing delivery initiatives, each of which aims to benefit the Scriveners Clan. 

Orion University has partnered with Independent HIP 43670 Labour, which is requesting deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]] in HIP 43670.  

The university’s campaign was explained by Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew: 

“Although Dredger J-403 is legally our property, what we value most is the Scriveners Clan’s dedication to deep-space research. To convince them of our noble intentions, we are donating scientific data and samples to their Knowledge Core. Our proposal is that they permit us to accompany them on their journey and share in any future discoveries.” 

An alternative campaign is also taking place in the HIP 43670 system. Supporters of the Scriveners Clan are being asked to gather emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses and deliver them to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson told the media: 

“These supplies are needed to perform vital repairs to the dredger. Furthermore, if the power systems are sufficiently updated, they can bypass the ancient components affected by Orion University’s override codes and continue travelling independently.” 

Although there remains no response from the Scriveners Clan, the dredger is now actively monitoring all local and interstellar transmissions. This is a new development for the isolated community, and suggests they are aware of these campaigns.
