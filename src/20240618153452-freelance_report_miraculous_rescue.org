* Freelance Report: Miraculous Rescue

/23 Feb 3302/

In a system near the NGC 1333 nebula, over 1,000 light years from the nearest starport, a pilot by the name of Commander Santander has reported discovering two occupied escape pods. The Commander was surveying a previously uncharted system and cruising near the surface of a rocky-ice body when the readings were detected. The crash site could be clearly seen from high altitude, so Santander went to investigate in his SRV. Fortunately, his Asp Explorer was equipped with a cargo rack.  

In a transmission, the Commander said: "I don't know how long they've been on this rock, or if the pods are working. I can't do much for them here â€“ my ship is fitted for exploration, not search and rescue. I'll get them to port and let someone else open them up."
