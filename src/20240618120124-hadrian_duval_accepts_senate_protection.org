* Hadrian Duval Accepts Senate Protection

/02 Nov 3307/

The Empire has officially proclaimed Hadrian Augustus Duval and his wife Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval to be wards of the Senate. 

The offer of senatorial protection was made following an [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] attempt to assassinate them and their unborn child by bombing Dyson City starport. 

Prior to being transported from the Paresa system to a secure location, Hadrian Duval sent this message: 

“Lady Astrid and I accepted this offer with enormous reluctance. Neither of us wish to abandon our home or loyal followers. Yet we feel it is a matter of duty to protect our family and ensure future generations of the Duval bloodline.” 

“Nova Imperium will henceforth be known as Nova Paresa. It will continue to serve as a staunch ally of the Empire, as per the Treaty of Paresa. To all those who fought for our cause over the years, I assure you that history will never forget us. Memento Mordanticus!” 

There has been public support for Praetor Leo Magnus to assume leadership of Nova Paresa. Hadrian Duval has endorsed his former head of security taking his place, but confirmed that the title of Imperator is now defunct. 

In related news, ACT stated that its investigation into the Dyson City attack has yielded results. Although details remain embargoed for security reasons, a significant breakthrough is expected to be announced soon.
