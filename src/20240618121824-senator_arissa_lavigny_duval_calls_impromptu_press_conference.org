* Senator [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] Calls Impromptu Press Conference

Senator [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] Calls Impromptu Press Conference 
 
After the day’s Senate deliberations finished, Senator [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] stopped to answer questions from the assembled reporters. When asked what she considered the most important issue facing the Empire, she replied: 

“Most of all [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] needs stability and continuity. I was privileged to spend some time with Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] after he recovered from his coma. He shared with me a vision in which the Empire continues to build on its strengths of justice and tradition. 

“It saddens me greatly that anyone, especially someone considering themselves an imperial citizen, could bring an end to such a great man. I consider it my duty to make sure that his vision becomes a reality.” 

When asked if that meant she considered herself the heir to the Emperor’s throne, she stated: 

“The decision of who will become Emperor is in the hands of the Senate. There are many suitable candidates, and I am honoured to be among them. Whether or not I am crowned, I will continue to work toward the future that [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] shared with me.”
