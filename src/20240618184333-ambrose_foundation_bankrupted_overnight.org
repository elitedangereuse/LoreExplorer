* Ambrose Foundation Bankrupted Overnight

/09 Feb 3305/

The family-run Ambrose Foundation, a multi-billion credit institution, has lost its entire fortune in a single day. 

Business analyst Marlon Royce reported on Vox Galactica: 

“The Ambrose Foundation combines the wealth of several centuries-old royal and noble houses. It is primarily involved in corporate investment and occasional charity work.” 

“All of that changed abruptly when its accountants announced the loss of 100% of all assets, worth nearly three hundred billion credits. Inexplicably, everything the foundation owned has been liquidated and transferred to anonymous accounts at banks scattered throughout the galaxy.” 

“Local security services are investigating a possible data hack. But of greater concern is the disappearance of family heiress Lady Talitha Ambrose. Some fear she has been kidnapped and forced to provide authorisation codes to her colossal inheritance.”
