* 0674  Kahina Loren Stripped of her Rank
[[id:8da12af2-6006-4e7e-a45e-7bf8b2c299c8][Prism]]   

On October 14th 3302 [[id:2f09bc24-0885-4d00-9d1f-506b32464dbe][Kahina Tijani Loren]] was stripped of the rank of
senator for delegating her responsibilities in respect of the Prism
system to Ambassador [[id:47e03b47-2225-41ca-b331-af350e58572c][Cuthrick Delaney]] in 3301.

An aide for Admiral [[id:f4ab6958-497d-430c-b322-bc5c67aa7707][Denton Patreus]] said: "Loren gave up her senatorial
responsibilities, so it's unreasonable that she continue to be
protected by the title. Frankly, she shouldn't be described as a
'lady', either, but we will let the cours make that determination."
