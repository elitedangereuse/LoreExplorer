* Jeffress's Second Treasure Hunt

/29 Oct 3301/

Last month, the reclusive philanthropist [[id:67bd2189-aa99-45c2-902f-7db26bc2d2e3][Alfred Jeffress]] made headlines with his galaxy-wide treasure hunt, and now it seems the eccentric billionaire is at it again. Having promised that the first event would not be the last of its kind, Jeffress has announced a second treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner. 

According to a statement from Jeffress, the event will follow much the same format as the first. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will lead participants to the mystery object: 

"A dissatisfied scholar keeps a visionary in his grasp as he makes his deal." 

With such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.
