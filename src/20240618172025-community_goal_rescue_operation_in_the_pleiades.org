* Community Goal: Rescue Operation in the Pleiades

/03 Nov 3303/

Cooper Research Associates have launched a rescue operation to recover personal effects, data and people from Thargoid attack sites in the Pleiades Nebula. 

The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver occupied escape pods, damaged escape pods, black boxes and personal effects to the search-and-rescue contact at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system. 

A spokesperson for Cooper Research Associates released a brief statement: 

“Eyewitnesses have reported that Thargoid vessels are taking occupied escape pods from ships they have attacked. It is therefore essential that we recover any and all individuals from these attack sites before they can be similarly abducted.” 

The operation begins on the 2nd of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
