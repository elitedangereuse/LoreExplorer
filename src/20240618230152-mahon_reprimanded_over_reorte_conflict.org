* Mahon Reprimanded over [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Conflict

/25 Feb 3308/

The Alliance Assembly has delivered an official rebuke to its prime minister following the recent skirmish in the [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] system. 

There have been heated debates following the conflict between [[id:5292d8c1-fa6e-4352-a03f-ef984f706203][Reorte]] Mining Coalition and [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. This was triggered by the megacorp’s unpopular attempt to establish a presence in the system as an anti-xeno defence partner. 

Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] led a motion to censure against Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]], which successfully passed with a plurality of votes after some abstentions. The strongly-worded reprimand focused on ‘disregarding the Alliance’s principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]’. 

After Mahon formally accepted the reprimand, Councillor Kaine addressed the Assembly: 

“This body does not have the right to govern its member systems without their consent. The strategic defence pact must become civil legislation rather than a military contract, so it can be passed as law.” 

“I call upon [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] to agree to these terms, or else to abandon the pact and remove [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]’s forces from the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]], [[id:b716cd52-6ba1-4fdc-a555-d01bc73b2893][Arimpox]], [[id:25537b36-1d83-4354-afeb-482bf891d85d][Di Jian]] and Leesti systems.”
