* [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]] HQ Moves to [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] System

/19 Feb 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The capital system of the Alliance now hosts Lakon’s administrative
hub and offers a 5% discount on its ships.

The company’s main offices have been relocated to the [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]]
Central planetary port on [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] 1 a.

All shipyards within the [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] system are offering a permanent 5%
discount on sales of vessels manufactured by Lakon. Pilots will need
to obtain a permit for Alioth to take advantage of this reduction.

Both the move and the discount reflect the Alliance’s recent purchase
of a majority sharehold in the company. This was primarily to retain
it as a key defence contractor for the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]].

[[id:321b3694-38ea-481e-9899-77b5cb951f14][Naomi Landseer]], chairperson of the board of directors, announced:

“We are extremely pleased to be partnered with the Alliance,
especially after recent tumultuous events. Lakon’s highly regarded
ships will remain available across the galaxy.”

The attempted takeover of [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]] by [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] was revoked
due to revelations of illegal practices by its former CEO, [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter
Rochester]]. Federal news sources have reported that a rapid restructure
is taking place within Core Dynamics, alongside investigations by the
[[id:d75a6c3f-5c3a-418b-b639-5e14b487f568][Federal Intelligence Agency]].
