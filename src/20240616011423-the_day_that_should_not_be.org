* The day that should not be

/29 Feb 2016/

Having been labeled as a crackpot by most civilized space, tin foil
hat wearing conspiracy theorist [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]] has teamed up with
[[id:897c2aeb-49d0-4822-a060-62679585624b][Kruger 60 Free]] to fund a one day appeal for pilots to deliver
cartographic data that will help him prove his theories that according
to ancient records he claims to have unearthed show that the 29th
Feburary 3302, which appears on all galactic calendars, should not
exist.

Bentonio went into more details at a press conference claiming that the
entire human race would be wiped out if something is not done and had
this to say when questioned about his theory.

"We're not just talking about see ship systems failing and computer
system across the galaxy shutting down. We're talking about all life as
we know it stopping instantaneously, the very fabric of space time
collapsing in on itself and the universe as we know it coming to an end
in the blink of an eye."

Pilots that want to contribute to the appeal are instructed to go to
[[id:9e44a970-e43e-4fa7-b58a-7357e73878cb][Jones Estate]] in [[id:6db801f4-9e17-46a2-8412-827e3064c370][Groombridge 34]] system and drop off any cartographic data
they have on the 29th February.
