* Success for Pleiades Restoration Project

/08 Jun 3304/

There has been a positive response to the campaign to fund repairs for starports in the Pleiades Nebula. Huge quantities of construction materials were received, which will be used to restore many of the stations damaged by the Thargoids. 

Senior engineer Lilith Galloway made a statement on behalf of Aegis Research: 

“We didn’t expect so many of you to help. But that’s the spirit here in the Pleiades – we come back stronger. Our thanks to everyone who supplied us with what we need.” 

Pilots who contributed to this project can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.
