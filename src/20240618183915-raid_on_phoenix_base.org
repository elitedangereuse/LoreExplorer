* Raid on Phoenix Base

/19 Oct 3304/

An attempt by armed intruders to access Phoenix Base in the Meene system has been foiled. The base is the home of engineer Ram Tah. 

Security Chief Harper Vargas gave this report: 

“Defensive systems alerted us to a small group of intruders who had breached the base’s perimeter. Our teams engaged them in combat and forced them back to a waiting ship. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the ship or prevent it from escaping.” 

“During the incursion, the intruders used explosives to sabotage the base’s power network. Fortunately, the base remains operational." 

Ram Tah told the media: 

“I believe this was an attempt to steal research data or samples of Guardian technology – the implications of which are most disturbing. Although the attempt failed, it has disrupted my important research.”
