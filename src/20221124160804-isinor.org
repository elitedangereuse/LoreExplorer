Faction: [[id:5dd9b81f-9ba1-491a-976a-1f4b38e25714][Chapter of Isinor]]
Benefits: "Convoy beacon" game play content. Basically there is a
Type-9, escorted by two Federation security vessels (with no cargo)
which holds resonating separators and a special good called
"antiquities" in small and varying amounts (picture below blue
note). These special goods can be sold at any black market for roughly
90k depending on demand.
