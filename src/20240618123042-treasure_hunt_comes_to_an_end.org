* Treasure Hunt Comes to an End

/23 Dec 3301/

The third treasure hunt from eccentric billionaire [[id:67bd2189-aa99-45c2-902f-7db26bc2d2e3][Alfred Jeffress]] has come to an unexpected end, with not one but two pilots claiming the grand prize. Commanders MAX RED and Sync Mercy completed the treasure hunt within seconds of each other, prompting Jeffress to declare them both winners. 

As with Jeffress's previous treasure hunts, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery object at the centre of the search. Competitors were led to multiple systems, eventually landing at Lasswitz Terminal in the Mentor system, and finally to the Prism system where the mysterious object was found. 

When the winners were announced, [[id:67bd2189-aa99-45c2-902f-7db26bc2d2e3][Alfred Jeffress]] released a brief statement: 

"I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the winners, both of whom will soon receive a share of my personal fortune and the deeds to a new ship. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all those who took part â€“ your enthusiasm has made this endeavour more than worthwhile."
