* [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] Campaign to Establish Marlinist Colonies

/10 Dec 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Commodities are requested to create new settlements for Marlinist refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation. 

Sirius Corporation has offered to resolve the current standoff between superpowers by establishing colonies where the refugees can live independently. 

[[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]], CEO of [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], summarised his proposal: 

“It is clear that the Marlinists cannot return to the Empire, and are a destabilising presence within the Federation. We offer an alternative by constructing permanent habitats for their population. These will be self-governed and may freely trade with the galactic community.” 

“Sirius cannot stand by while the risk of interstellar war increases. I sincerely hope this leads to a more stable and profitable period for us all.” 

After intense debate, both Congress and the Senate accepted the proposal, with the proviso that any refugees identified as [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] members will be returned to the Empire. 

Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader, also offered her approval: 

“We were forced to abandon our entire lives because of our political beliefs. This at least gives us a chance to have homes again.” 

Traders are asked to deliver atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers to Ellis [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]] in the Bd+05 1146 system. From there, the Omega Merchant Command will distribute resources for the colonisation of up to ten uninhabited systems.
