* Titan Survivors Kept in Quarantine

/23 Oct 3309/

Thousands of people rescued from captivity within the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] motherships remain isolated under strict medical and security protocols. 

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, spoke at a press conference: 

“I’m relieved to see that the sub-surface extraction missiles are proving effective, especially considering how quickly they went into production. Many pilots are using them to excavate bio-storage capsules from beneath the hulls of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Titans.” 

“Each resuscitated individual has undergone an exhaustive range of physical scans and psychological evaluations. Some are being treated for stress-related conditions and mental trauma, but otherwise they appear to be unharmed. With no clear evidence that these people have been infected or influenced by the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] in some manner, Aegis has sent a number of proposals to superpower governments as they consider the next steps.” 

Despite this announcement, everyone extracted from a bio-storage capsule remains under military quarantine. The Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent factions have all instructed that any citizen who was abducted by [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] must be kept in high-security isolation until further notice. 

As discussed by reporter Ernesto Rios for Vox Galactica: 

“There is widespread concern that whatever the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] had planned for their human captives was set in motion before rescue efforts began. While scientific analysis of the captives disputes this notion – as all results have thus far – the returnees may face prejudice and mistrust when they are permitted to rejoin society.” 

In related news, there are reports that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] barnacle matrix sites have recently undergone enormous growth, with sightings of ‘towering spires’ and similar megastructures. Aegis and other scientific bodies have sent analysis teams to all known sites to gather data.
