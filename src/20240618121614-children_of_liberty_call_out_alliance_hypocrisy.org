* Children of Liberty call out Alliance Hypocrisy

/07 Aug 3301/

Children of Liberty call out Alliance Hypocrisy 
 
A group calling itself the 'Children of Liberty' has made a public statement concerning [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] and what they call its “rampant hypocrisy”. The group claims that a "huge gulf" exists between the Alliance's professed goals and values and the reality present in many of its member systems. 

"For an organization that purports to be devoted to the ideals of liberty and self-determination", the release stated, "the Alliance certainly tolerates a great deal of despotism and tyranny within its own borders. It's about time [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] addressed the rampant hypocrisy of allowing dictatorships – as well as other restrictive, undemocratic forms of government – membership into their supposed bastion of freedom and liberty." 

The statement went on to list a number of Alliance-sponsored autocracies in various systems, and called on [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] and its supporters to sponsor serious democratic reform in said systems by backing democratically-aligned factions over autocratic ones.
