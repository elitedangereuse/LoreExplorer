* Defence and Delivery Requests for the Sirius System

/04 Mar 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Empire is aiding Sirius Corporation by offering bounty hunting and trade opportunities to support the Galactic Summit. 

The diplomatic conference is now entering its second week, with superpower and independent leaders gathered at Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system. 

Sirius Corporation’s CEO [[id:f0655b3a-aca9-488f-bdb3-c481a42db384][Li Yong-Rui]] announced: 

“Our thanks to the Federation for organising additional security against unexpected numbers of vessels this past week. Anarchic extremists, political enemies and opportunistic criminals all attempted to disrupt the conference to no avail. Pilots who helped maintain the peace can collect their rewards at the Spirit of Laelaps.” 

“For the coming week, we are working with [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] to maintain the security operation by offering bounties on all wanted ships. [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][The Empire]] will also pay generously for extra supplies of animal meat, coffee, fish, fruit and vegetables, and wine that are delivered to the Spirit of Laelaps.” 

Pilots are reminded that neither permanent nor temporary permits to enter the Sirius system apply to fleet carriers. This joint initiative will run for one week, followed by Sirius Corporation partnering with [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] for the final week of the Galactic Summit. 

In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are continuing to offer a 10% discount on all their ships to mark the historic occasion.
