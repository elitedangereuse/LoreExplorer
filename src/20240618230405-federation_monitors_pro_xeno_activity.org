* Federation Monitors Pro-Xeno Activity

/12 Sep 3308/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has warned of heightened interest in the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult and groups considered sympathetic to the Thargoids. 

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the Proactive Detection Bureau, delivered a public statement: 

“We have confirmed a significant increase in communications between local chapters of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] religious order, which includes the sharing of unverified xenological data. The Thargoids’ victory in HIP 22460 seems to have caused unprecedented excitement among the cultists. At present, there is no evidence that they pose any danger to the public. However, we are concerned by a recent increase in citizens abandoning their conventional lifestyles to join the cult.” 

“We have also noted the rising popularity of a civil movement that advocates diplomatic relations with the Thargoids. This rhetoric is being promoted by several high-profile media figures. There is currently no known connection between these ‘xeno-peace’ supporters and the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult, but both groups are being closely observed for potential criminality.” 

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, the leading academic authority on the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] faith, submitted his observations to [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]:  

“Recent events in HIP 22460 have galvanised the cultists, but also seem to have triggered an element of discord among some. Worshippers are abandoning the orthodox hive-chapels and pledging themselves to the True Chapters sect, where the First Apostle is being hailed as a holy messenger of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]]. My contacts inform me that the Testament megaship has despatched scouts to locate a more permanent home, likely to accommodate a wave of new converts.”
