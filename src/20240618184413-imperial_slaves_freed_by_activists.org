* Imperial Slaves Freed by Activists

/15 Jun 3305/

A company that purchased 4,000 Imperial slaves has revealed itself as a slavery emancipation group. 

Using the name Tilbery Construction, the group claimed that the slave workforce would be used to build a water treatment facility for Port Isabelle, the capital of [[id:9fa174ce-7273-40ba-a0e6-1225bcda40b6][Eotienses]] A 3. Instead, the slaves were transported outside the city and set free. 

The individual acting as the company’s CEO, Garrett Kline, made the following statement:  

“The true purpose of Tilbery Construction was to provide liberty. As members of the group Autonomy, we renounce institutionalised abuse and fight for human dignity. I am proud to say that we have returned four thousand enslaved people to freedom, so they may live their life however they wish.” 

Autonomy is a network of radical activists opposed to the Empire’s tradition of indentured servitude. It has forcibly liberated slaves on several prior occasions, but never on such a scale.
