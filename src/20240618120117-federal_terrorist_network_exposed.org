* Federal Terrorist Network Exposed

/13 Oct 3307/

The Proactive Detection Bureau has been instrumental in identifying violent corporatist extremists within the Federation. 

Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the Federal Intelligence Agency gave a statement to the media: 

“In recent weeks, our surveillance algorithms flagged a series of coded communications for investigation. We found that a network of radicalised citizens were discussing plans to assassinate members of Congress and leading political figures.” 

“This movement, which calls itself Jupiter’s Wrath, is inspired by [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]]’s failed attempt to enable corporations to directly rule the Federation. Their goal was to enact revenge on those who they consider to be the ‘enemies of [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]]’.” 

“Using data intercepted by the Proactive Detection Bureau, FIA agents performed a series of coordinated strikes in several Federal systems. Over a thousand armed extremists were arrested before they could act. We are currently working to identify the remaining Jupiter’s Wrath members.” 

Vice President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]] claimed that this was further validation of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, which permitted the PDB to be established. However, Shadow President [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] commented: 

“I commend the FIA for performing their duties. But I also question the timing of this operation, coming so soon after President Hudson’s appallingly reckless attempt to capture [[id:b4892958-b513-46dc-b74e-26887b53f678][Yuri Grom]]. To me it seems calculated to show his administration in a positive light, while ignoring the violation of citizens’ privacy.”
