* Full Scale Attack on Polahukuna Postponed

/13 Mar 3301/

Following the declaration of war by President Halsey earlier today, the Federal Navyâ€™s attack on Polahukuna has been postponed indefinitely. Instead the newly built Capital Ship  , the FNS Nevermore, will be diverted to help with the offensive against Lugh. 

Unfortunately, due to the actions of Operation Arm Chop , the FNS Nevermore is not yet equipped with a full contingent of fighters. As a result, the FNS Nevermore will not be able to set off for Lugh until the construction of its personal fleet is complete. 

Core Dynamics estimate that it will be another six or seven days before the FNS Nevermore will be able to join Federal forces in their attack on Lugh, until which time it will remain safely harboured in Hudson Dock.
