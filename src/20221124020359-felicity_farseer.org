She knows about [[id:7ec2457b-3e53-4928-a17f-e885b681b267][The Dark Wheel]].

From the Knowledge Base:
: Oh, they're out there alright. I've never met them, but _I know they're out there_.
: Think about how well known the stories are. Now think about
: how easy it would be for some two-bit band of hucksters to pass
: themselves off as the Dark Wheel and start trading on their
: reputation. Doesn't happen, does it? Not for long, anyway. Whenever
: someone tries to usurp the Dark Wheel name, sooner or later they get
: quietly shut down. And that's how I know.
