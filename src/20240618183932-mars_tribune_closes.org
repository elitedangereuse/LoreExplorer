* Mars Tribune Closes

/22 Nov 3304/

[[id:a5b054ac-dff0-434b-ade6-09d5f81228a1][The Mars Tribune]] has been closed and its owner arrested in the wake of
the [[id:de12e7c6-dc67-403d-bdd5-aadb52313312][spy]] [[id:0c43c44c-33fe-4b99-a5e0-2f2be9dc67b0][robot]] scandal.

The announcement was made by Detective Captain [[id:67e55dd5-7840-4133-9111-566a0008b121][Ramesh Thorne]], who was
recently reinstated to, and promoted by, the [[id:0ba9accc-93ad-45a0-a771-e26daa59e58f][Federal Security Service]]:

“[[id:74cae77e-fab1-4a22-9c31-daaa15d8fd0e][Kingsley Cordova]], editor [[id:6d78c541-458f-413f-83fd-e86ab6415c8e][Lana Sigrid]] and other employees of The Mars
Tribune have been arrested for [[id:f1778ba6-dab1-442b-88ff-1dfe06ee2616][blackmail]] and corruption. The newsfeed
has been permanently dissolved, and the [[id:ba42b0e5-1d3f-4541-874f-f324124c0980][Cordova Group]] conglomerate
subjected to a government audit.”

“I would like to thank the anonymous [[id:e72cde19-08be-465d-a02f-b69134025a61][whistle-blower]] who exposed
Cordova’s scheme. She has now removed the surveillance program from
all [[id:04ba4637-336a-46c7-bab0-3ac12f16b2f9][Achilles Corporation]] [[id:0b7fcbab-6e37-401a-8d52-4d2dee8e5c1e][PA912]] robots in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.”

Chief Editor [[id:186bc9ae-20b5-4403-83f9-a19bd76f7c59][Lena Ravenhill]] wrote in [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“The Mars Tribune abandoned its professional ethics in its hunt for
salacious headlines, thereby undermining the role of honest journalism
in our society. We are relieved to see justice done.”
