* Winters Acknowledges Growing Calls for Inauguration

/17 Sep 3310/

President-elect Felicia Winters has discussed the growing discontent within Federal Congress over her delayed inauguration. 

A series of devastating earthquakes struck Winters’s home world of Rhea 3 in February this year. Millions were killed during the unprecedented disaster, including six members of Winter’s family in the destruction of the capital New Greenacre. 

Winters took an extended leave of absence to direct relief and recovery efforts on Rhea 3, which included a widespread appeal for resources from the independent pilot community. But recent articles in Sol Today have suggested the goodwill for Winter’s situation may be wearing thin. 

Political journalist Ewan Klein recently wrote: 

“When Winters first announced the delay to her inauguration, there was obvious resistance from her Republican opponents – though perhaps less so from President Hudson, who has remained in office temporarily. As more details of Rhea’s turmoil came to light, support for Winter’s choice on compassionate grounds increased.” 

“Seven months later, however, some in Congress have started to wonder if Winters will ever overcome her grief and accept the presidency.” 

Winters has finally released a statement on the matter via the Federal Free Press: 

“Nothing can ever repair the hole left in my heart following the tragedy on Rhea 3. That pain is shared with millions of families affected by the catastrophe that befell our home world. We may never truly overcome it, but must resolve to move forward despite it.” 

“And during our darkest hours, the outpouring of love and support from across the Federation has been a source of great strength. I was reminded a thousand times over of the charity, selflessness and warmth of Federal citizens. Your patience has been cherished, and it is time that your faith in me as president-elect is rewarded.” 

“I plan to step back from personally directing the recovery of Rhea 3 in the near future, leaving the task in the capable hands of Rhea’s emergency aid and relief committee. When the time is right, my inauguration ceremony will proceed and I will humbly accept the role of President of the Federation.”
