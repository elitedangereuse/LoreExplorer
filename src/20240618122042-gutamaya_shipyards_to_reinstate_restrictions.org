* Gutamaya Shipyards to Reinstate Restrictions

/06 Nov 3301/

Last month, Gutamaya Shipyards marked [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]]'s coronation by temporarily lifting the rank-related restrictions on all Imperial ships. With the official coronation period now over, the company has announced that the restrictions on its ships will be reinstated on Monday.
