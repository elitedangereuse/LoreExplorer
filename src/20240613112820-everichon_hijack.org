* 0117 Everichon Hijack
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]  

In 2559, the tourist liner [[id:f7538ec0-9b0a-4fb9-ab4e-27c8abc4ae72][Everichon]], full of Imperial nobles, was
hijacked by a [[id:a593cd5c-015e-4639-8501-181a6c9d47c6][Caker]] group who planned to crash it into one of the gas
giants. The attempt was thwarted by Imperial commandoes. The holo-vid
broadcast and subsequent fictional dramatisation 'Rebel Madness', went
some way to diverting popular opinion from the insurrection.
