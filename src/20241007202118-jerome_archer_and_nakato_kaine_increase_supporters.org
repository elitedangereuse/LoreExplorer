/29 Aug 3310/

Civil, commercial and political groups within the Alliance and
Federation are pledging loyalty to two increasingly high-profile
individuals.

[[id:e660f840-caed-45ef-985e-f75170cf9ca8][Sofia Trevino]] published a summary for [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] has long been the figurehead for a wide
range of Federal communities and corporations. But as he prepares to
depart the White House, many of these are transferring their
allegiance to the new head of the [[id:5f587ce0-8fb6-4535-aadf-e2f11154e6f6][Republican Party]], Vice President
[[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]].”

“When [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] becomes president, [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Archer]] will take on the role
of [[id:98a18cdb-c516-4c5c-8bd6-c8c4c707e991][shadow president]] and lead the Republican opposition to the
governing [[id:4cfca8e0-b6a6-4e86-b777-4754f914fa3e][Liberal Party]]. He will effectively inherit [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Hudson]]’s
political power base, which spreads across the Federation and through
many independent systems. Many millions of people, including members
of the [[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots’ Federation]], will perform tasks and exploit local
resources in order to expand [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Archer]]’s influence.”

In the Alliance, a similar situation is now being recognised, as
discussed by [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] of [[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][The Alliance Tribune]]:

“Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] is the representative for the [[id:0b991a8e-234a-4888-8c0a-b3c64498f217][Tionisla]] system
and has been a vocal presence in the [[id:48ac5ad9-dd0e-4d43-a109-f4cf6d3efdea][Assembly]] for several years. She
ran against Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] in the 3307 elections, gaining
many followers despite being ultimately unsuccessful. [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Kaine]] has also
directly opposed many of [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Mahon]]’s policies, particularly the strategic
defence pact with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]], on the grounds that the
Alliance’s founding principles should not bend to megacorporate
influence.”

“This has led [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Kaine]] to become a rallying point for those who wish to
see Allied systems governed more like the [[id:aeb65196-44a0-477f-a564-b5019348eb01][Old Worlds]]. She is a
proponent of electoral reform that would allow the public to directly
choose their leaders, rather than the [[id:48ac5ad9-dd0e-4d43-a109-f4cf6d3efdea][Assembly]] voting on their
behalf. Many local businesses, organisations and political bodies have
been attracted by [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Kaine]]’s ambitions to transform the Alliance.”
