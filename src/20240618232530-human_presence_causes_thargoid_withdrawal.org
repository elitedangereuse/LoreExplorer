* Human Presence Causes Thargoid Withdrawal

/31 Aug 3309/

The Thargoids have unexpectedly abandoned the region around [[id:800924c4-1b40-46e2-a929-3da627d6caef][Wregoe BU-Y b2-0]], mere days after being discovered. 

They were believed to be present due to an ancient site on the planet
[[id:0b904675-a3c9-4aa7-ad4f-5d1886a6e792][Wregoe BU-Y b2-0 1 c]], which hosted a conflict between Guardian and
Thargoid forces millions of years ago. Aegis has confirmed reports
that all Thargoids have now disappeared from that area of space. [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden
Tanner]] delivered a summary:

“Our pilots can no longer detect a single Thargoid ship anywhere in
that region. In military terms, they have undertaken a full tactical
withdrawal. It usually requires overwhelming firepower to drive out
Thargoid forces, especially from multiple systems. In this case, there
was no fleet action or anti-xeno operation sufficiently large to cause
this response.”

Dr [[id:9dfc056b-14da-469e-ac5f-80519edcaf58][Jeong-Hui Shin]] of the [[id:3d9b071c-c232-431f-8f63-5c3a594b9909][Holloway Bioscience Institute]] observed: 

“This is atypical behaviour for the Thargoid species. Their
territorial instincts are usually aggravated by the arrival of humans,
as witnessed in several of the nebula colonies. It is unprecedented
for them to avoid engaging us in battle. We can only theorise that
their purpose for being in this region was interrupted, perhaps even
invalidated, by our presence.”

[[id:30324619-c5be-4eb5-9ec0-dd7a2562bde3][Dev Venkatesh]], a prominent xeno-peace advocate and former lecturer at
[[id:b0f0e40a-14e9-422d-aa9d-5ff6296f3421][Orion University]], told [[id:4ab0f53c-0b85-43a3-83ca-b9e88c0db30e][Vox Galactica]]:

“Frankly, this is a disappointing development. Here was a chance to
observe this intelligent race in a non-combat environment, but it’s
clear that our ships disrupted the Thargoids’ plans. I find it
encouraging, however, that they chose to simply retreat instead of
fight. We must hope that a similar opportunity will one day present
itself, and perhaps we can approach it with greater caution.”
