* Freelance Report: Attempt to Sabotage [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station Thwarted

/20 May 3302/

Three individuals carrying pamphlets identifying them as members of 'The Hands of the Architects' have been apprehended at [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station. Starport personnel discovered the individuals attempting to modify the station's frame shift drive. 

A station spokesperson said: "The individuals are apparently members of a cult that arose shortly after [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] first claimed to have encountered super-intelligent, non-human life. Materials confiscated from the individuals indicate that they hoped to force a mis-jump during [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]]'s forthcoming journey to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]]. Apparently they thought this would give them an opportunity to meet Halsey's 'architects'." 

The would-be saboteurs are currently being held in custody at [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station while starport personnel discuss possible extradition with nearby systems.
