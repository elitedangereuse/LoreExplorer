* Second Fatality in Rackham Conflict

/29 Mar 3305/

The head of personnel at [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]] has died in an accident, becoming the second senior-level employee to have died in recent weeks. 

Journalist [[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]] commented in [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“Senior executive Derrin O’Shea was killed when his personal limousine malfunctioned and crashed. The incident has not been ruled as suspicious. O’Shea’s position was filled within hours by a supporter of Taja Gavaris, however. Gavaris herself inherited the CFO role in a similar fashion following her predecessor’s recent death.” 

“With two close allies gone, CEO [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] must feel under threat. This corporate power struggle increasingly resembles two pirate captains fighting to become overall leader.” 

“The authorities have again declined to begin a formal investigations into Gavaris and Rackham, claiming a lack of evidence. How many more casualties must occur before this conflict is taken seriously?”
