* Galactic News: Construction Appeal Concludes

/16 Mar 3303/

A spokesperson for the Military Militia has extended its gratitude to those who supported its recent appeal for construction materials. In a statement, the spokesperson said: 

"Thanks to the galactic community, we are now in a position to start work on the Soldiers' Respite installation." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Pellegrino Hub in the XI-2 Lupi system.
