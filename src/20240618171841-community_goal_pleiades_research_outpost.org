* Community Goal: Pleiades Research Outpost

/21 Jul 3303/

The recent revelation that the Thargoids have returned to human space has sent shockwaves through the galaxy. 

Some, such as Federal President Zachary Hudson, have reacted defensively, promising to protect humanity from what they believe is an aggressive alien race. More moderate voices have underscored the need for further information, since so little is known about the Thargoids. 

One such voice belongs to Abroin Universal Plc, which has announced plans to establish a research outpost in the Pleiades Nebula – one of the centres of Thargoid activity. 

A spokesperson for the organisation said: 

“The Thargoids are active principally in the Pleiades Nebula, so we are eager to establish a research outpost there. As [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] said, there is potentially a great deal we could learn from them. Hopefully this new outpost will let us do just that.” 

Abroin Universal Plc has placed an open order for Semiconductors, Lithium and Energy Grid Assemblies for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Campbell Horizons in the Abroin system. The organisation placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those delivering material to Campbell Horizons can do so safely. 

The campaign begins on the 20th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
