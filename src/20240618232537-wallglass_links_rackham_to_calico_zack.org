* Wallglass Links Rackham to ‘Calico Zack’

/18 Sep 3309/

The Federal Times has published evidence that trillionaire and presidential candidate [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] was once the pirate lord ‘Calico Zack’. 

The newsfeed featured a detailed exposé by financial journalist [[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]]: 

“The Wallglass Investigations Agency has confirmed my long-held suspicions about [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]]’s past. With the timely assistance of independent pilots, we have unearthed a message archive concealed in the Zeta Trianguli Australis system.” 

“This was created as insurance by a pirate named Angelo Defries. Wallglass’s analysis revealed that Defries learned of [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]]’s alter-ego over sixteen years ago, and threatened to transmit evidence to several newsfeeds – including, ironically, us here at [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]].” 

“While Defries seems to have disappeared around 3292 with his evidence withheld, conversations from that period were traced to the Wishbone Point facility. Wallglass, in conjunction with volunteer pilots, tracked down and decrypted the damning logs.” 

“This vindicates my many years investigating Rackham’s criminal activities and corruption. More importantly, we have proved that the Federation is at risk of electing a pirate lord as its president.” 

Vox Galactica reporter Patricia Chen covered the story: 

“Mr Rackham strenuously denied these allegations, stating that he always tolerated ‘being associated with a mythical figure’ as it gave him ‘an aura of danger that was useful in boardroom meetings’. His devoted followers say that the evidence was manufactured for Wallglass to find, and that [[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]] is secretly funded by either [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]] or [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]].” 

“However, high-profile supporters such as business magnate ‘Sir’ Randolph Plaskett and [[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE-caster]] [[id:f3e0128c-f8fd-4b90-a2c0-0ae5a5e487d0][Sura Oyekan]] have publicly withdrawn their support. The value of shares in [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]] has also nosedived. With a month until the voting period opens, this discovery has disrupted an already much-delayed Federal election.”
