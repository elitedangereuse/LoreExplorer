* Tour of Frontier Systems Set to Begin Shortly

/06 May 3301/

Despite a rather sceptical response to the President’s planned tour of Federal frontier systems, particularly the bizarre choice to visit 78 Ursae Majoris (a system which overwhelmingly voted to leave the Federation nearly two months ago), the President’s office has announced that the series of visits with local leaders will go ahead as planned. 

The following systems have already been announced as being part of the President’s trip: 

Hip 53688 

Tinia  

78 Ursae Majoris 

Su  

Furuhjlem I-645 

Saga 

Delphin 

Nanoman 

Coriccha 

Ross 860 

Another dozen systems are expected to be added before the President sets off on tour later in the week.
