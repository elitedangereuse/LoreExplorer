* Claims of Federal Involvement

Claims of Federal Involvement
 
With the long history of conflict between the superpowers, it is not
unexpected that some of the more paranoid members of the Imperial
population have directed their suspicions concerning the Emperor’s
assassination at the Federation. While no-one in authority within the
Empire takes these claims seriously, some of the citizens and lower
members of Imperial society wonder that if the claims aren’t true,
then why don’t those in charge simply say so?

Some believe that these unanswered, if unreasonable, questions lay at
the heart of some of the trouble reported in the queue of mourners on
Capitol.

To many of us, the thought that the Federation would risk all-out war
by killing the leader of the only other superpower capable of battling
them on equal terms is far out there. But it’s not the craziest theory
by a long mark.

Conspiracy theorist [[id:0766a856-8f47-43b8-9242-b40309dbf07f][Ricardo Bentonio]] claims that the Emperor is not
dead, instead it is just his human host that has been transformed and
the being we knew as Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] has returned to his
homeworld in the [[id:0a33b305-8f49-4a9f-8c0a-177cab9cd72c][Andromeda]] galaxy.
