* President Kincaid’s Conspiracy Exposed

/07 Jun 3305/

[[id:ad2baca1-f970-4308-8b07-78cd4a5a8fd0][The Alliance Tribune]] has revealed that Admiral [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Frederick Yamamoto]] has committed multiple crimes at the behest of Alliance president [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]].  

In a detailed report, journalist [[id:b26ee6ca-29a4-4dca-b69f-b4957b1ae650][Vanya Driscoll]] said: 

“As part of a plea bargain to avoid life imprisonment, [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Yamamoto]] has
provided [[id:415ecd29-3cf3-4f3c-ab29-a7debb4b56de][Alliance Interpol]] with data regarding actions carried out on
the direct orders of [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][President Kincaid]].”

“Along with the [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassination]] of presidential candidate [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]],
[[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Yamamoto]] arranged to murder, injure and intimidate many others to
facilitate [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Kincaid]]’s rise to power.”

“The admiral coordinated his efforts with a number of influential
corporate, military and political figures, who allied themselves with
[[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Kincaid]] in exchange for certain advantages. This included a [[id:e9439fe0-8637-4330-b5fd-b4f1643cf472][Bank of
Zaonce]] senior director, who illegally redirected funds to bankroll
Kincaid’s re-election campaign.”

“[[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Kincaid]]’s ultimate aim was to transfer executive power from [[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]] to
[[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]], establishing a base of support to eventually become the
supreme ruler of the Alliance. But with such a detailed and damning
testimony from [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Yamamoto]], it seems impossible that his presidency can
survive these revelations.”
