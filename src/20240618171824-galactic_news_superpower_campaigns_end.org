* Galactic News: Superpower Campaigns End

/23 Jun 3303/

Last week, the Empire and the Federation launched initiatives designed to bolster their presences in the Pleiades star cluster. 

Both superpowers placed open orders for construction materials for use in their respective campaigns, and the response from the galactic community was overwhelmingly positive. Huge quantities of material were delivered to Obsidian Orbital for both the Federal campaign and the Imperial initiative. 

It seems that despite widespread opposition to the Federal-Imperial conflict, both superpowers still enjoy considerable support among the galactic community. 

The [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] Expeditionary Fleet, which coordinated the Imperial initiative, and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which oversaw the Federal campaign, have extended their gratitude to their supporters. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiatives can now collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] system.
