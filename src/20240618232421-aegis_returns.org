* Aegis Returns

/13 Feb 3309/

The anti-xeno agency Aegis has been officially reformed by the Alliance, Empire and Federation. 

Aegis was initially founded in 3303 to centralise research into the Thargoids, as well as coordinate defence and rescue operations. It was disbanded in 3308 following accusations of incompetence in the wake of the Alexandria disaster and the subsequent findings of the Baumann Report. The recent escalation of the Thargoid War and calls for renewed collaboration between the superpowers have led to a reversal of that decision. 

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]] will serve as the head of the revived organisation. She provided details at a press conference: 

“Aegis remains humanity’s best hope of ending this calamitous war with the Thargoids. Its priority is to better understand the alien species through scientific research, and to utilise those findings to improve our defensive and weapon capabilities.” 

“Each superpower has appointed an individual to oversee its contributions: Deputy Prime Minister [[id:82f88fe3-91eb-4e78-824e-ec809cb81ea9][Angela Corcoran]] for the Alliance, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] for the Empire, and Congressman Tom Gillespie for the Federation. We have also invited many independent specialists to partner with Aegis, including Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]], [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] and a previous key member of Aegis, [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]].” 

“Criticism from the Baumann Report has been taken on board. Our new organisational structure follows the streamlined approach used by the [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][Affiliated Counter-Terrorism]] Unit to great success. To improve coordination, a limited application of [[id:22dfd239-84ed-4b35-aa95-bc955ca95e8b][Omega Grid]] networking will facilitate rapid and secure communications between key members.” 

“Aegis’s first research project is already underway. The engineer [[id:7af58443-6856-4aa9-89ff-89c94bd63aa7][Petra Olmanova]] has approached us with preliminary designs for a method of allowing ships to survive longer within the Maelstroms’ corrosive clouds. We have assigned several metallurgy and chemistry experts to develop this further.”
