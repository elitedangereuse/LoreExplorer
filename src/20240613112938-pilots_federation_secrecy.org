* 0247  Pilots Federation Secrecy
[[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Shinrarta Dezhra]]

[[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][The Pilots Federation]] in many ways is a secretive organisation. This
in part reinforces its status of neutrality. It exists to support
pilots, not nationalities or political factions. Over the years this
has led to its acceptance (albeit grudging in some cases) in
practically all human domain.

Despite its ubiquitous presence it has very little direct dealings
with the public. Even member pilots tend to interact via the networked
rankings and bounties system. The prime exception to this is
registration. A pilot has to register in person for their PF
license. Registration is performent at offices throughout human
habitted space.

The PF represents the nearest thing to law in uncontrolled and
ungoverned space. Their existence provides a safely net for human
expansion in space beyond the major factions.

[[id:29d1e8f4-004d-4d0f-b838-265c302d8187][The Elite Federation of Pilots]] (EFP) continues as a select and
extremely secretive group within the larger organisation.
