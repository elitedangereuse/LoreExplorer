This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica.

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence:

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,403 systems

Rank 2: Aisling Duval – 1,383 systems

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval - 1,269 systems

Rank 4: Yuri Grom - 995 systems

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui - 724 systems

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.
