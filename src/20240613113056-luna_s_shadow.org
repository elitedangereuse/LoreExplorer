[[id:8bafd5bc-a8ae-4d53-893a-687a46e7706e][Smootoae QY-S d3-202]]   

This beacon marks the 11th waypoint of the Distant Worlds II
expedition, a five-month journey to the far outer rim conducted
in 3305. Situated on the galactic prime meridian, this system is
notable for containing a water world orbited by a satellite similar in
size and appearance to Earth's Moon.
