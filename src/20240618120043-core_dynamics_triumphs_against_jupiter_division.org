*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The corporate faction [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] has been defeated by the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system. 

The breakaway faction from [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] was unable to resist efforts by its parent company to recover ships and resources. [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]] will soon be subsumed by Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics. 

Owen McKenna, the CEO of [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]], declared: 

“Thanks to the Silver Legal Group and other loyal allies of the Federation, we have finally crushed this criminal enterprise. Let this be an end to the delusions of [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]].” 

Many newsfeeds believe that [[id:a35c5eb2-0697-4ef3-9a11-950791952e2d][Jupiter Division]]’s defeat will have a negative impact on the corporatist movement that has recently emerged within some Federal systems. 

Director [[id:98555862-d2af-4b4a-be86-672f289e1b73][Theodore Sullivan]] of the Silver Legal Group confirmed that those who fought on their side can now collect payments from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.
