  "If the history of eugenics tells us anything, it is that we do not
  tend towards greater egalitarianism over time, but rather find new
  ways for the privileged to exploit and control the dispossessed.
  Nevertheless, I do occasionally dream of ways in which we might evolve
  further."

  "If I could change just one aspect of human nature, it would be our
  chronic tendency towards tribalism. In that matter, we have barely
  advanced a step in a million years. While the sun shines, we meet and
  treat with one another, but when the skies darken, we withdraw and
  whisper suspiciously. And at the first flash of the unknown, we huddle
  like witless primates in a cave, terrified of the thunder, trusting
  only those who smell the same as us."

Professor Ishmael Palin is a scientist specialising in research into
nonhuman technologies and cultures, with particular emphasis on material
artefacts. He is generally considered one of the galaxy's foremost
experts on the Thargoids.

Professor Palin began his career working for the Federal government as a
member of the Homeland Scientific Council. In 3301, when objects
apparently of nonhuman origin were discovered in a number of systems,
the Federation launched a research programme and placed Professor Palin
in charge.

To the surprise of many, the programme was shut down after only a week,
ostensibly on the grounds of safety. Palin refused to comment on the
decision, but inside sources later revealed stark differences of opinion
between Palin and the Federal authorities. Palin insisted that the
fruits of his team's research into the so-called 'unknown artefacts',
later reclassified as Thargoid sensors, should be open to everyone, but
his Federal paymasters wanted the Federation alone to benefit.

Palin promptly established his own research body -- the Palin Institute
-- and announced his intent to relocate to the Maia system, beyond the
boundaries of superpower-controlled space. His ship disappeared shortly
after he set of for Maia, however, and it was not until March 3302 that
Palin and his crew were discovered, alive, in escape pods in the Orulas
system. Palin revealed that unknown parties had abducted the team, held
them captive and questioned them extensively about their research.

Shortly thereafter, Palin stepped down as head of the Palin Institute in
favour of Cora Shaw, citing opposition to his work from 'dark forces' as
the reason. He established his own independent research centre on Maia A
3 a and began to study meta-alloys, a material sourced from the Thargoid
structures nicknamed 'barnacles'.

In October 3302, Palin discovered that meta-alloys could be applied to
the development of new defensive technologies, but no sooner had the
news broken that the Federation blockaded his research centre with a
Farragut-class Battlecruiser, preventing all access. The move was
condemned by the Alliance and the Empire, but the Federation appeared to
take no notice.

Almost a year later, in September 3303, the Federal blockade was lifted.
No explanation was given either for the blockade or for its cessation.
The event has since been interpreted as the beginning of the end of the
Federal-Imperial cold war.

In July 3305, Palin was forced to abandon his research centre when the
Thargoids entered the Maia system en mass. Together with his team, Palin
was evacuated to the Arque system, where he wasted no time in
establishing a new base of operations at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E.

Professor Palin's career has been an inspiration to many young
scientists, partly because of his determination that research should
benefit everyone, and partly because of his dogged tenacity in the face
of repeated interference. He was aware that by choosing to study the
Thargoids, he was making himself a target, since there were shadowy
agencies who very much wanted to be the sole beneficiaries of this
research, but he defiantly persisted with his work nonetheless.

Professor Palin may not consider himself heroic, but the fact remains
that many less principled scientists in his position would have long ago
submitted to intimidation or the promise of material reward.
