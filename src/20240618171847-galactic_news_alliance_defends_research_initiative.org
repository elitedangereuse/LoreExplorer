* Galactic News: Alliance Defends Research Initiative

/16 Aug 3303/

The Alliance has been criticised for its recent appeal for Thargoid data, which began only days after a joint-superpower initiative was established to study the Thargoids. 

A number of independent factions, including the Federal Republican Command, have censured [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] for its apparently contradictory stance. 

A spokesperson for [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] was quick to respond: 

“Aegis emerged from a spirit of unity, so we can understand why an independent initiative could be seen as undermining that philosophy. The simple truth is that it takes a long time to plan a campaign of this sort, and in this case our preparations began long before Aegis was established. Cancelling the campaign would have had dire repercussions for our partners, the Kaushpoos Pro-Alliance Union, to whom we have a contractual obligation. Rest assured that the instruments we plan to develop will be made available to Aegis, to which [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] is fully committed.”
