* Galactic News: Generation Ship Found

/30 Apr 3303/

Before the development of faster-than-light travel, [[id:d1f19609-fdb7-4991-bcb2-e93435f013d0][colonising]] distant
star systems depended on vast interstellar arks known as [[id:951f3d20-c3aa-41cc-ba58-cc7d3a5a1d07][generation
ships]]. There are believed to be more than 70,000 of these ships in the
galaxy, the location of many of which is not known.

But now one of these ‘lost’ ships has been found. A transmission
recovered from a [[id:4df4a36a-20bf-43ca-9bf1-2324f832ab81][listening post]] in the [[id:079cf648-49db-4fb6-825b-e27e68ccf2ef][LHS 1047]] system led a pair of
independent pilots to the [[id:448469f4-f4a5-4cdb-80d9-d040393740bf][Alaunus]] system, where the generation ship
‘[[id:63ee3e04-15bb-48f4-8ccd-4926715ce34b][Lycaor]]’ was discovered. Tragically, it appears that the ship’s crew
was killed by an [[id:dd5abb31-73fb-4390-82ad-33030cb49d38][unidentified pathogen]], no doubt many centuries
ago. This was confirmed by remotely accessing the ship’s medical logs.

System authorities have urged pilots not to interfere with the vessel,
which is still protected by the legislature instated at the time of
its launch.
