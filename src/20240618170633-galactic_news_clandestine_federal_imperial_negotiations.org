* Galactic News: Clandestine Federal-Imperial Negotiations?

/20 Jan 3303/

Animosity between [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] and the Federation has been growing for months, but leaked communications suggest that clandestine negotiations may be taking place between the two superpowers. 

Jason Nygaard, a reporter for The Federal Times, said: 

"We believe the Federation is meeting with Imperial dignities behind closed doors. The nature of these meetings isn't clear, but we have noted unusual ship movements around the historic Cambridge space port." 

Cambridge, once of the few ancient Earth cities preserved in its historic form, is notably free from surveillance. It has been associated with many remarkable events in its long history.
