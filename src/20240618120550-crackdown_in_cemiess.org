* Crackdown in [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]]

/21 Feb 3301/

There’s trouble brewing in [[id:360ae21e-63f2-43ba-a2fd-a47e5e49951e][Cemiess]], caused in no small part by the recent influx of emancipated Imperial Slaves who now call the area their home.  

The number of petty thefts and burglaries being reported on Emerald has risen by over 300% compared with the same period in 3300, resulting in local social sites being flooded with complaints from long term residents who claim they fear for their families’ safety. 

In response to the unrest, Commissioner Chamberlain of Emerald Security issued the following statement: 

“While we appreciate the situation may feel like it’s spiralling out of control, we do advise all citizens to remain calm. Crime is up, but no more than what we might expect to see after any large group suddenly moved into the area. We understand residents are concerned about their security and as such a curfew is being put into effect. However, we would like to stress that this is purely a temporary measure until such time as our newest residents have integrated more fully with the local community.”
