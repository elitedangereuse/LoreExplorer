* 0166 Early Hyperspace
[[id:da11b7b5-2c5a-4f17-9cd4-ce28a2f34dbd][Tau Ceti]]

The 22nd century saw early pioneering projects begin to take
shape. The discovery of a workable hyperspace theory and the design of
the first unreliable, inefficient and slow 'faster than light' drive
(compared to those we are used to in 3300) opened the possibility of
exploration and settlement. A new frontier of science and engineering
opened, confirmed by the first detailed messages and system scans t o
be received back to Earth from an interstellar probe sent to the Tau
Ceti system years earlier. This led to a corporate race-for-the-stars
as massive colony projects were founded, funded, built and launched,
together with hundreds of automated probes sent to all the nearby
systems.
