* Operation Tyndareus Reacts to Thargoid Fleet

/06 Oct 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The Alliance has deployed a reactionary task force to defend the Andecavi system from the Thargoids. 

An anti-xeno taskforce, titled Operation Tyndareus, was recently prepared by the [[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] in conjunction with [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. This followed the ratification of the strategic defence pact between the superpower and the megacorp.  

Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Navy representative on the Council of Admirals, announced: 

“The Thargoids have encroached upon Allied territory, providing an opportunity for Operation Tyndareus to put this newly legislated partnership to the test. The megaships provided by [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp are on combat readiness for just such an event, and Kumiho Sky has jumped directly to the Andecavi system to act as a mobile base of operations. The ADF will spearhead our counter-attack against the alien forces.” 

“These are still early days for our unified anti-xeno efforts, so we are requesting additional support from independent pilots. [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] will award its pre-engineered heatsink module to those who destroy adequate numbers of Thargoid vessels.” 

The Andecavi system reported the presence of Thargoids over the past forty-eight hours.  However, as with recent incursions into other populated systems, no starports have yet been attacked. [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] will reimburse Thargoid combat bonds delivered to the Kumiho Sky over the next seven days.
