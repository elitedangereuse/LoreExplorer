* Lucan Onionhead Lives On in [[id:267299e4-1a3f-4835-933d-7a1b30d7d43e][Tanmark]]

/24 Feb 3301/

The Defence Force of [[id:267299e4-1a3f-4835-933d-7a1b30d7d43e][Tanmark]], in association with the Farmers Union of Kappa Fornacis, is pleased to announce the success of their initiative to increase the local production of Lucan Onionhead. 

Over the last week hundreds of independently minded contractors delivered over 500,000 tons of land enrichment systems to Cassie-L-Peia. Specialist farmers from Kappa Fornacis were then able to stimulate the mass growth of Lucan Onionhead clones.  

When asked for comment, President Halseyâ€™s office reiterated that Lucan Onionhead is illegal within all Federal jurisdictions and that anyone caught transporting, cultivating or otherwise selling the drug would be subject to prosecution.
