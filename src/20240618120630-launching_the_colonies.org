* Launching the Colonies

/12 Mar 3301/

Almost a thousand years ago, a corporate colonisation project from Earth set out on a trip to find a new home among the stars. The colonists settled in the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] system, where they became one of the leading suppliers of drive fuel anywhere in the galaxy, and so the Sirius Corporation was born. 

The [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation has a long history of colonising worlds beyond the borders of occupied space, which is why the Sirius Corporation is pleased to announce that it will be returning to its roots with the launch of 9 new colonial outposts, all of which should start being deployed within the next 14 days. 

The 9 systems chosen to act as new homes to [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation colonists are:
