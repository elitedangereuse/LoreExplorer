Hafnium 178m2-Hf, atomic number 72. This nuclear isomer has the
potential to unleash enormous quantities of gamma radiation, making it
an excellent ingredient for use in devastating weapons of mass
destruction. As a result Hafnium 178 is a highly controlled substance
that is universally illegal to own without special dispensation.
