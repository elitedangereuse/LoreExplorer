* [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Arrests Rogue Officers

/23 Nov 3304/

The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] has responded to the revelation that members of its private fleet coordinated a mercenary raid on the Meene system. 

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corp, told the media: 

“Following a thorough inquiry, we have confirmed that a cabal of junior officers, with the aid of mercenaries, orchestrated an illegal operation to gain access to Phoenix Base. Although their intentions remain unclear, I can confirm they were acting purely in their own interests, and without official knowledge.” 

“The rogue officers, including those extradited into our custody by the Meene Defence Force, now face multiple charges, and could be imprisoned for life.” 

“I would like to express my sincere regret over this incident, and to personally apologise to [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]]. I continue to hope that we can work together on further Guardian-human technology.”
