* Galactic News: [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] Enters [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]]

/12 Aug 3303/

A number of media outlets have reported that the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] has entered the [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]] system, establishing two new outposts. 

Although the mega-corporation has asserted that the outposts will support mining operations in the region, commentators have speculated that [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] is positioning itself to take control of the system’s barnacles. 

Daxton Sung of the Imperial Herald commented: 

“Right now, the Federation controls [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]]. But [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] is playing the long game. They’ve positioned themselves close to the barnacles so that if the Federation pulls out of the system, they can swoop in and start hoovering up meta-alloys.” 

The new outposts will no doubt be a boon to independent pilots in [[id:70fa34ea-bc98-40ff-97f0-e4f4538387a6][Merope]], giving them access to a wide range of services.
