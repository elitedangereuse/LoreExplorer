* 0188 The Black Prince
[[id:113500ff-cc01-4fe3-a0f4-87d92e2c2d31][Zelada]]

Many decades later the infamous cinematic biography of the [[id:6c5d5774-5308-4b6f-a575-5ce96cf440db][pirate]]
calling himself "[[id:1fc1d4cf-210e-47c5-86f8-30cda45471ef][The Black Prince]]" claimed responsibility for all
these attacks, using what grew to a highly mobile small fleet of
well-equipped matt black [[id:79778442-b881-46ca-8783-f6d9bc4b8233][Anacondas]] acting together, each carrying a
smal, nimble one-man fighter. The attacks stopped not because of the
Federal fleet, but because the Black Prince and his brothers in piracy
retired to the outer systems on the wealth they had acquired. Many
doubt his story as most of the facts do not check out - but others
claimed he had simply exaggerated what was a basically true but far
more seedy story.
