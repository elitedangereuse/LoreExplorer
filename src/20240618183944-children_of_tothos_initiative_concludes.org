* Children of Tothos Initiative Concludes

/13 Dec 3304/

An initiative to deliver rare commodities to an esoteric cult in the Zlota system has concluded. 

Independent traders provided Aganippe Rush, Motrona Experience Jelly and Onion Head for a ceremony to be performed by the Children of Tothos. Other pilots protected the rare goods from being taken by pirates. 

Barnabas Cole, leader of the Children of Tothos, gave another handwritten message to the media: 

“By helping us, you free yourselves. You will feel the light of our testament fill you, just as it fills the heavens.” 

The initiative was organised by Zlota Federal Holdings, which allegedly counts some high-ranking officials as cult members. Contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.
