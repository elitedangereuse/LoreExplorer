* Allied System Receives Vital Resources

/05 May 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Sirius Corporation has helped provide commodities to sustain the [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]] system during the ongoing Thargoid assault. 

Pilots transported multiple shipments of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food cartridges to the megaship Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] in the Leesti system. These were then redirected to [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]] and distributed wherever they were most urgently needed. 

The campaign was orchestrated by Admiral [[id:2e8a3cd7-5f4e-47dc-ba7f-eb732bf8c7fa][Nikolas Glass]], who announced: 

“By replenishing key supplies during this time of great crisis, [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] Corporation has again shown its dedication to the Alliance’s military efforts. This will undoubtedly pave the way for the strategic defence pact to be accepted by the Assembly once the trial period has completed.”  

Sirius Corporation has confirmed that all pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect payment from Chariot of [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] in Leesti. 

In related news, the superpowers are continuing to reward independent ships for destroying Thargoid vessels in the [[id:d508fb0f-0214-4133-829f-edb61e2681d0][Didio]], [[id:b38c4ed0-3aaa-4a86-8acd-a241164d680f][Novas]] and [[id:2a81ce70-848a-46eb-aa0b-b5626e78e8aa][Sosong]] systems. [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s anti-xeno superweapons are expected to be operational one week from today.
