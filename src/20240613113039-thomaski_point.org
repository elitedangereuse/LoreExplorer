* 0708 Thomaski Point
[[id:b641744b-4037-4e0d-b0d7-c470991111e7][Slaiyooe OX-L d7-0]]

CMDR [[id:992821cc-e3d9-45b4-b52a-d77b530a9d21][Thomaski]] was a rare kind of man. Thoughtful, kind, empathetic and
ambitious extending even to making the trip to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]] which he
achieved in the year 3303... albeit with a few dings and bumps along
the way!

He was an avid lover of exploration and photography among many other
things, and spent his time traversing the galaxy with friends, putting
the world to right while finding black holes, neutron stars,
unexplored systems and everything else the cosmos could offer him.

He's now found his place among the stars and will be remembered by his
family and wingmates for years to come, and we hope that upon finding
this beacon you will be inspired to achieve your goals and reach for
the stars, just like CMDR [[id:992821cc-e3d9-45b4-b52a-d77b530a9d21][Thomaski]] would have wanted.

o7, Commander. We'll see you in the black.
