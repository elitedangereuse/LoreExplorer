* President Winters Assumes Office

/31 Oct 3310/

The inauguration ceremony has taken place to formally swear in [[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][Felicia Winters]] as the president of the Federation. 

President Winters made a public address from the White House in [[id:bb96c46f-09d5-4e50-ac48-026557d18621][Olympus Village]] on [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Mars]]: 

“I pledge to work for the benefit of each and every individual within
our Federation. My administration will redirect funding away from
corporations toward improving health, public services and quality of
life. Together, we will launch a new era of optimism and opportunity!”

“My first act is to order the [[id:d75a6c3f-5c3a-418b-b639-5e14b487f568][Federal Intelligence Agency]] to shut down
the [[id:ea0acf7b-8942-4f0c-a78e-18b1e0a3fd8a][Proactive Detection Bureau]]. The illegal surveillance of all
communication ends now. We will propose to [[id:614fd344-ec09-483c-a28e-0289590946c4][Congress]] that the [[id:33b63cf3-a3ee-4d98-9e20-571f548d7b8b][Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act]] of 3307 is revoked, allowing our [[id:5bd5ffaf-9210-4ee4-a1ef-46228d431c11][Federal Accord]]
to uphold each citizen’s constitutional right to privacy.”

The presidential election was held in October 3309, when Felicia
Winters eclipsed her rival [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome Archer]] by four per cent of the
vote. Her inauguration was delayed for a number of reasons, including
the personal tragedy affecting the Winters family after disastrous
earthquakes on [[id:920aa2b6-fc99-4783-9b6d-a62d1bcd78bd][Rhea 3]].

[[id:b9fe58a3-dfb7-480c-afd6-92c3be841be7][President Winters]] is supported by Vice President [[id:cdb2224f-eb0b-45d0-b37f-9daccae07c32][Isolde Rochester]],
matriarch of the famous [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochester family]]. The [[id:4cfca8e0-b6a6-4e86-b777-4754f914fa3e][Liberal Party]] will now
form a new Federal government, led by a hand-picked Cabinet. This
includes Congressmen [[id:4f55df5e-8d8d-4aaa-b4a5-40d667b751d3][Kristine Lasky]] as Secretary of State, [[id:a95edcc6-f406-49e5-898c-cdeb3f07cab6][Conn
Montgomery]] as Secretary for Defence, Bai Zheng as Secretary for
Security, and [[id:9dffc624-7d15-4ae9-977e-6c22115b590c][Pierre-Marc Pelletier]] as Grand Attorney.

Former President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] has officially vacated the office,
having served since 3301. His successor, Shadow President [[id:7bdfd887-d1db-46bc-98c4-2fb39bfcc914][Jerome
Archer]], will now lead the Republican Party as the opposition.
