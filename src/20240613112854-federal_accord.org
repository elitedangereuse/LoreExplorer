* 0174 Federal Accord
[[id:da11b7b5-2c5a-4f17-9cd4-ce28a2f34dbd][Tau Ceti]]

In early 2240, hours before the [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]] fleet arrived in Tau Ceti, the
main settlement changed its name to [[id:ee59bbe7-79e2-49ae-a2bc-c25554526ea3][Taylor Colony]] and voted for
[[id:ff0ce877-d755-40d6-b92e-618c54344b29][independence]] from Earth. Without the starships to give battle, the
colonists targeted the Earth fleet dropships as they attempted to
land. Neither side could could an advantage and so diplomacy
resumed. With some bitterness on both sides, a negotiated settlement
was reached and in 2242, the Federal Accord was announced. This was
effectively an extension of the consitution of the Federation, which
briefly changed its name to the "Federation of Star Systems" - but
this did not stick, and the term "Federation" returned.

The Federal Accord granted independent rights and membership to each
system that signed it, provided they met certain development
goals. Initially each of the signatories (including Earth) did not
meet the goals, as the core principle of the agreement made at Tau
Ceti was to eliminate the political games that had been played in the
previous century.
