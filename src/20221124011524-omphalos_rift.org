* Omphalos of [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]]

* Mythology
  Omphalos (Omphalos is also the name of the stone given by Zeus's
  mother [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] to [[id:a2e0d49b-625c-4809-be7e-14ddc43a7ee9][Cronus]] to eat in place of her new-born son.)

  In Ancient [[id:6d41fe41-7975-4de3-b77c-29899aa1add0][Greek]], the word ὀμφᾰλός (omphalós) means "navel". Among
  the Ancient Greeks, it was a widespread belief that [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]] was the
  center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding
  of the [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]]c Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of
  the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and
  the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed,
  crossed their paths above the area of [[id:846bfbc7-75e7-4d8d-8716-7fe0346026f4][Delphi]], and so was the place
  where Zeus placed the stone.[1]

* Hypothesis
  Could be [[id:df71ddf4-a45f-4785-b42a-bcd5a396e8ac][Ammonia]] based world for Thargoids to retreat after the
  first war? The same way humans did for [[id:85f1b96f-7e6c-4350-9f42-fe1b9453de1a][Project Dynasty]]?
