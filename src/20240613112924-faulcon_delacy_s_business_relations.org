* 0225 Faulcon Delacy's Business Relations
[[id:0da8edee-c8ff-4aed-9ff9-ce8ae998bef3][Reorte]]

[[id:a35836b6-243b-45eb-9d79-faae08802d0c][Faulcon deLacy]] manufactures many of the smaller components in its own
ships, and has a well established relationship with the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius
Corporation]], for its hyperdrives and power plants. It is also a big
customer of the [[id:acc63f52-1101-4a91-8a47-9f52c9f74540][WCM Corporation]] - buying its hull alloys from them as
raw material.

It still operates a modular system for the construction, which
operates throughout their range of products, and all ships are built
to a standardised grid system. It has also innovated too - allowing
its competitors to use the same system - which has benefitted Faulcon
deLacy greatly, and ironically makes acquisition a straigtfoward
process.
