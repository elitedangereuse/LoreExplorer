* Community Goal: Rescue Operation in the California Nebula

/29 Dec 3303/

The Alliance has reported that ships travelling to and from its California Nebula outposts are coming under attack from pirates. The attacks are of such frequency and ferocity that the bases are in danger of being completely cut off. 

An Alliance spokesperson said: 

"The systems lining the route to the California Nebula are strewn with the wrecks of Alliance vessels, but with the pirates still an active threat, we have been unable to recover escape pods from these shipwrecks. We are therefore launching a two-pronged operation designed to both thin the pirates' numbers and recover the escape pods. We hope we can rely on the support of the galaxy's independent combat pilots." 

The operation has received financial support from the Turner Research Group, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver escape pods to Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system. 

The campaign begins on the 28th of December 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
