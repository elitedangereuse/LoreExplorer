* NMLA Aims to ‘Extinguish the Duval Line’

/15 Oct 3307/

The [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army]] has taken responsibility for the attack on Dyson City starport in the Paresa system. 

The primary targets were Imperator [[id:c4f47591-9c52-441f-8853-536f577de922][Hadrian Duval]] and his wife Lady [[id:ef9ddb06-8cb2-4c3f-a688-469be3149aa9][Astrid Minerva-Duval]], who is pregnant with his child. Although they survived, the bombing left many thousands dead and injured. 

The following message was sent across NMLA propaganda channels: 

“As long as a single Duval is left alive, the Republic of [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]] cannot be rebuilt. It is our duty to extinguish that entire line and free our people from Imperial oppression.” 

Praetor [[id:3fdf3f05-e7b5-436f-906e-e67dafa5d254][Leo Magnus]] gave a statement on behalf of [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]]: 

“It is significant that this latest broadcast is not from [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]], the NMLA’s mouthpiece and de facto leader. We believe that Theta Group – the team of weaponsmiths that built the caustic enzyme bombs – has split in two.” 

“According to the communications we intercepted, [[id:7878ad2d-4118-4028-bfff-90a3976313bd][Theta Seven]] and half of his followers went into hiding after the attacks against the Marlinist Colonies in July. The others continued their terror campaign and were responsible for this latest atrocity. [[id:a152bfb8-4b9a-4b61-a292-824ecbd263e1][ACT]] is currently pursuing leads and hopes to learn more soon.” 

Nova Imperium has repeated a call for pilots to help rescue survivors from Dyson City in the Paresa system.
