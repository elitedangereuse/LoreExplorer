* Rebellion Spreads Through the Federation

/13 Sep 3307/

A further seven Federal factions have severed ties with the superpower in protest against government monitoring of communications. 

These latest secessions have been undertaken by minor factions that do not control any systems, including Unktock Free, United Posenoi League and Progressive Party of Inggale. 

Political journalist [[id:e660f840-caed-45ef-985e-f75170cf9ca8][Sofia Trevino]] reported for [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“Eight factions had previously declared independence from the Federation, and now an even greater number forms the third wave of rebellion. It’s clear that their populations feel empowered to take a stand against losing their constitutional rights of privacy.” 

“Vice President Archer shrugged off this latest development, maintaining that ‘the Proactive Detection Bureau performs a vital security role in these troubled times’. Since none of these latest factions currently govern a system, he may also believe that resistance to the PDB is on the wane.” 

“Although these events have only impacted a small part of Federal territory, they remain an embarrassment for President Hudson’s administration. Shadow President Winters continues to implore Congress to repeal the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, but she has also taken political criticism since many feel her rhetoric inspired these factions to secede.”
