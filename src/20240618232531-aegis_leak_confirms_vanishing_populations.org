* Aegis Leak Confirms Vanishing Populations

/01 Sep 3309/

A private discussion among Aegis leadership regarding mass Thargoid abductions has been made public. 

Recordings of Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]] and [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]] were sent to and published by all newsfeeds, including the Pilots’ Federation. File data shows that their conversation took place shortly before Professor Tesreau’s statement to the media on July 18th, in [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]]’s office at Aegis headquarters in [[id:b16e9508-ccde-4a48-86ff-f3674c9c720e][Duamta]]. 

After a brief period of speculation, [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]] herself confirmed that she released the logs. Seo indicated that rumours circulating on ‘alternative [[id:a12cdcbc-fa10-474e-8654-d3d7da17a307][ICE]] channels’ of Aegis withholding information from the public were false, and that Tesreau intended to announce evidence of human abductions even before the Dedicant tragedy brought the news to prominence. 

Ernesto Rios analysed the new information in an article for Vox Galactica: 

“Leaks of classified information are nothing new, but it is rare that they support rather than damage the target organisation. According to these recordings, the topic of millions of people missing from Thargoid-invaded systems was carefully considered prior to Aegis informing the public.” 

“A significant revelation relates to the visions experienced by [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]]. She tells Tesreau and Tanner: ‘An image keeps repeating… Rows and rows of what I thought were eggs.’ But then clarifies: ‘They’re pods. Containers for humans.’ Seo claims that abducted people are being kept alive aboard the Titan motherships. The reason remains unknown, though Seo insists the abductees are ‘important to the next phase of the Thargoid invasion.’” 

“Tanner then queries that Aegis might develop a way to recover these pods. We have yet to see confirmation that Aegis is investigating this possibility. But the prospect of extracting prisoners from within the fearsome Titans will only appeal to the most courageous or foolhardy pilots.”
