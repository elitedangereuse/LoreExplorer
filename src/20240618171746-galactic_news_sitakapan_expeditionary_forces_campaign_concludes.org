* Galactic News: Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces Campaign Concludes

/05 May 3303/

A spokesperson for the Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces has announced that the group’s appeal for military-grade weapons and chemicals has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Russell Hub, the organisation’s base of operations. 

The Sitakapan Expeditionary Forces have extended their gratitude to those who supported the campaign. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Russell Hub in the Sitakapa system.
