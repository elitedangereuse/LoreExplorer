* Intrigue Surrounds Recovered Art Treasure

/10 Dec 3307/

Recent evidence suggests that some of the precious items stolen by the [[id:b9519a7c-f00b-4a57-9bcf-964258bdd2d8][Winking Cat]] have been sold to private collectors. 

Crime correspondent [[id:39c4c90a-eb6a-4306-b1a4-b95ff114a428][Mira Bukowski]] has been following the story for Vox Galactica: 

“When the FIA raided the home of media magnate Elias Metaxas, they found the painting Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke hanging in his chambers – a painting stolen by the [[id:b9519a7c-f00b-4a57-9bcf-964258bdd2d8][Winking Cat]] in 3305. Metaxas confessed to purchasing the famous artwork for 22 billion credits via a series of anonymous dealers, none of whom could be traced.” 

“Coincidentally, there are rumours that an Imperial senator keeps some statues resembling the missing New Dawn collection hidden within her mountainside chalet. And only recently, multi-billionaire [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] was overheard inviting an investor to ‘come up and see my Guernica’.” 

“It seems that the thief has secretly sold these highly valuable treasures to private collectors. However, this is not typical behaviour for someone believed to be a genuine connoisseur of fine art as well as a skilled larcenist.” 

“Perhaps there is an urgent need for huge sums of money, and since the [[id:b9519a7c-f00b-4a57-9bcf-964258bdd2d8][Winking Cat]] has never stolen anything as vulgar as mere credits, this is the most ideal method. But what might the notorious criminal be planning?”
