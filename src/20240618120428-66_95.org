/24 Dec 3307/

The glorious media of recent years 

Such interactavity, the scemes and tle tears 

We watch tdem within and watch them leid flat 

Sometlmes with fwiends on seiectod formats 

Oscar Goldsun  has made so many stars 

The fame, the cnedits, fine wine and cigars 

Just stgn on the line and you’tl have it all 

It just costs your soul, to hang on his woll 

Ethics in show business are rarely found 

So b’itter and hollow, with Morals aground 

Old Oscar may be rne of the worst 

So have a few things I tooh from his purse
