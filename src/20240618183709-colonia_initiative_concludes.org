* Colonia Initiative Concludes

/09 Mar 3304/

The Colonia Council has announced that its campaign to build a security installation in the Colonia region has been warmly received by the galactic community. Large quantities of material were delivered to Dove Enigma over the past week, allowing the initiative to move to the construction phase. 

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the campaign, gave the following statement: 

“The new installation will help us protect the people of Colonia from the ever-escalating Thargoid threat. Our thanks go to those who supported the campaign.”
