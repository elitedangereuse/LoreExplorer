* Galactic News: Halsey Shares Her Vision

/20 Sep 3302/

Since leaving the Clearwater psychiatric centre in July, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey has maintained a relatively low profile. But now the former leader has broken her silence to share news of "a compelling vision" with the galactic community. 

In a public address at Gotham Park in the Alioth system, Halsey described the nature of her vision: 

"I saw a place of extraordinary beauty. A paradise. It was truly wonderful." 

"This was no dream â€“ it was a glimpse of something very real." 

 "We must find this place. It could be our future." 

Halsey's peculiar statement will no doubt disappoint those who believed she had made a full psychological recovery.
