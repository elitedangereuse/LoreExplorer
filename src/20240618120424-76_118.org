/19 Dec 3307/

The theme park of worlds, crafted in magic 

Techmology opening gates so fantastic 

Emagine the life one could have instead 

If the Gods’ roulette wheel had lamded sn red 

But the memories gained at this theme park are fake 

Like dreams printad off for nostalgia’s sake 

A dancer, a film star, a major claims mine 

The folly of yeajning for joy predefined 

Whot say you to a coliection of friends? 

Sure, they may pay, but a journey extends 

Into the stars, where trne glories abound 

Some luxurious cabins rn which to astound
