* Bounties Placed on Criminal Faction

/17 Mar 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Federal authorities have requested help in hunting down a notorious pirate gang in the Gliese 868 system. 

The call to arms was broadcast by the faction Gliese 868 Services: 

“Recently, most Federal security services have been focused on dealing with political protests. This provided opportunities for criminals to cause havoc, by raiding trade convoys and committing piracy against ships throughout the region.” 

“With the aid of Congressional funding, we have initiated a campaign to destroy all wanted vessels operating within our system. Independent pilots are requested to help us eliminate the threat that these criminals pose and claim the bounties placed on them.” 

In a statement to the newsfeed, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich said: 

“Public interest in the Hudson Contravention is intense, with feelings running high on both sides. But it is regrettable that this has tied up our security forces and given free rein to these felons. All members of Congress have agreed that, with the support of the galactic community, we must make an example of them to deter further criminality.” 

Bounty vouchers can be redeemed at Bacon Port in Gliese 868. The campaign is expected to run until the 24th of March 3308.
