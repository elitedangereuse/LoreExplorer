* 0168 Early Colonies
[[id:595aa273-d1b3-44fd-9f16-ddc7291b4bee][Delta Pavonis]]

Other colonies followed soon after. [[id:595aa273-d1b3-44fd-9f16-ddc7291b4bee][Delta Pavonis]], [[id:0db1f0b9-a70d-4384-96a5-c1587a8270b1][Beta Hydri]] and
[[id:144149ef-21cd-4e52-afea-dcf379d12d18][Altair]] were all explored and settled between 2190 and 2230, and an
uncontrolled expansion followed, with corporations and all sorts of
groups of private individuals heading off into the stars. There was a
'wild west gold rush' atmosphere to it all, as news of vast tracts of
land, huge wealth, giant dinosaur-like beast, and heroic acts filtered
back to [[id:5b0f485f-4793-468d-a1a1-483606f44e0e][Earth]], with the romance of the process causing many to want to
leave the mother planet.
