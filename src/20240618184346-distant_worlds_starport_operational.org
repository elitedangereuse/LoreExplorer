* Distant Worlds Starport Operational

/21 Mar 3305/

The first starport constructed in the Galactic Centre region has officially opened its doors. 

Explorer’s Anchorage, an Orbis starport, has been built in the [[id:35fe6a51-9492-44a7-9dc5-4a5395ae732f][Stuemeae FG-Y d7561]] system as part of the Distant Worlds II expedition. 

Councillor Magnolia Gill, the starport administrator, announced its operational status: 

“For the last four weeks we have watched our new home take shape, using materials delivered by many hard-working pilots. Now it spins in the galaxy’s heart, a monument to humanity’s ingenuity.” 

“As well as serving as a safe haven for future explorers, Explorer’s Anchorage is a scientific research installation. We hope to learn more about the supermassive black hole at [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]]* and other astronomical phenomena in the Galactic Centre.” 

The Distant Worlds II exploration fleet is continuing its journey across the galaxy towards Beagle Point.
