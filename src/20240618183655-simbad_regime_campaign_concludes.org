* Simbad Regime Campaign Concludes

/26 Jan 3304/

A spokesperson for the Simbad Regime has announced that its appeal for construction materials has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. This has resulted in a massive influx of deliveries to Parmitano Terminal, the organisation’s base of operations. 

The spokesperson went on to say: 

“The Simbad Regime would like to thank all the Commanders who supported this project, and to invite the galactic community to visit our new base, once it is complete.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Parmitano Terminal in the Nu Tauri system.
