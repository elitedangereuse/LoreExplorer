* The Silence of Aisling Duval

/30 Aug 3304/

The date of Princess Aisling Duval’s wedding to Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester has passed without comment from either party.  

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios discussed the situation: 

“Public reaction to the cancelled wedding has ranged from outrage to delight. [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][Jasmina Halsey]] expressed regret at a ‘lost opportunity for long-term peace’, while Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] called it ‘the mercy killing of a catastrophically bad idea’.” 

“With no word from the Imperial Palace or the White House, it’s easy to imagine both Emperor Arissa and President Hudson breathing sighs of relief. But the silence from [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] and Jordan Rochester rings loudest. What might they be feeling? Was their relationship terminated against their wishes? Did it ever really exist?” 

“Naturally I invited the princess to tell her story, but her previous openness is apparently a thing of the past. The Rochester family is also shying away from the media. Jarl Toredo, whose alleged affair with Aisling apparently derailed the marriage, has vanished from public sight.” 

“Was this a tragic love triangle, or just a political chess game? We may never know. But what’s certain is that, before long, [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] will put these failures behind her and be back in the spotlight where she belongs.”
