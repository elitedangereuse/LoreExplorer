* Palin and [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] Seek Unclassified Relics

/19 Aug 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Two engineers who specialise in studying alien technology have requested deliveries of a newly discovered artefact. 

Professor [[id:8f63442a-1f38-457d-857a-38297d732a90][Ishmael Palin]] explained the details: 

“These ‘unclassified relics’ – as they are currently known – are Guardian in origin. Traditionally such artefacts trigger a hostile reaction from any Thargoid technology introduced to it. But our preliminary studies show a molecular realignment of the artefact’s crystalline structure, resulting in something that emits both Guardian and Thargoid energy signatures.” 

“This came to my attention only recently, unusual electromagnetic fields appeared on my sensors as CMDR Hurix approached Abel Laboratory while carrying one of these objects. I am now offering reimbursement to any pilots who can provide more relics for further study.” 

Ram Tah provided a similar statement: 

“This is an exciting development in the field of xenological research. For the very first time, Guardian and Thargoid systems have interacted to synthesise a new material. Initial data suggests this is now a consistent process whenever a Guardian relic interfaces with a Thargoid surface site. The first relic I saw was gratefully received from CMDR Demlagor’s team several days ago.” 

“What is their purpose? Have we accidentally unlocked some transformative function that was always present? Or have the Thargoids reconsidered their technological adaptation in response to recent events in the [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] system? With the help of contributing pilots, my shared research project with Professor Palin may furnish us with answers.” 

Unclassified relics can be delivered to Professor Palin at Abel Laboratory in the [[id:d4b595af-536d-4575-af11-f07f3ac3ff40][Arque]] system, or to [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] at Phoenix Base in the Meene system.
