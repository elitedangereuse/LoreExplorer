* Admiral Yamamoto Arrested for Murder

/01 Jun 3305/

Admiral [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Frederick Yamamoto]], head of the Alliance fleet in [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]], has
been charged with the [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassination]] of former presidential candidate
[[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia Silva]].

The shocking statement was delivered by [[id:e9a91ed4-acc1-4e93-9dee-b0aa03fd2ce9][Tashmira Silva]], who became CEO
of [[id:7863fb8b-665f-4a7d-ac70-582203695efd][Silva Holdings Inc]] after her [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][sister]]’s death:

“When the inquiry into [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia]]’s murder closed, I hired the [[id:b40c2b11-1199-4276-8f40-30cfcef498fa][Wallglass
Investigations Agency]] at great expense to uncover the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]]. They
identified that a professional [[id:a8068e9d-6706-47da-a19c-2ac943ea8811][assassin]] with a background in the
[[id:17d9294e-7759-4cf4-9a67-5f12b5704f51][Alliance Defence Force]] was responsible.”

“Unravelling a complex trail of financial evidence and [[id:e3a0c0aa-8459-4bb2-9135-7f97d5236df1][encrypted]]
communications led directly to [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Admiral Yamamoto]]. He personally
arranged to have [[id:e46779af-a26e-45fb-a784-21e970eeaae1][Fazia]] killed during the presidential election
campaign, presumably to remove her political threat to his friend
[[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][Gibson Kincaid]].”

[[id:415ecd29-3cf3-4f3c-ab29-a7debb4b56de][Alliance Interpol]] recently verified the [[id:b40c2b11-1199-4276-8f40-30cfcef498fa][Wallglass]] report and has now
detained [[id:090377a7-402e-4f38-8bad-b9b56230a846][Yamamoto]] pending trial. The [[id:4c65480c-a87b-421b-a91a-f1f1f8ecb737][Zaonce]] fleet has been placed
under the joint command of the [[id:b0b347ac-10b8-4190-8787-1557f7d4a6da][Council of Admirals]].

There has been no comment from [[id:8520e75f-0479-42c5-9083-f9abfbad721e][President Kincaid]].
