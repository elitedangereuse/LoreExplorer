* GalNet: Apology for Unauthorised Broadcasts

/27 Dec 3307/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

The GalNet editorial team expresses its sincere regret that further unscheduled messages have been recently published. 

A second batch of riddles were unlawfully transmitted across GalNet public feeds on the 24th, 25th and 26th of December. As with the three previous broadcasts, they were designed to invite independent pilots to locate a series of concealed caches. 

Our technical teams have identified the method by which the criminal known as the Winking Cat inserted unapproved articles into GalNet’s publication network. Security protocols have been heavily reinforced and we are confident that no further intrusions will take place. 

GalNet offers formal apologies to all members of the Pilots’ Federation for this disruption.
