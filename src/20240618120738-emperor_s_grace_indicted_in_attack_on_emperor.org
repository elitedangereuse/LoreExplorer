* Emperor’s Grace Indicted in Attack on Emperor

/27 Apr 3301/

Several weeks ago, Imperial Palace security uncovered an attempted plot to poison Emperor [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]]. Princess Lavigny-Duval and Chancellor Blaine both launched their own investigations into the matter. 

The Chancellor’s men managed to locate and question the would-be-assassin, but they were unable to extract any useful information. 

Fortunately, members of the Imperial Court had more success. They identified several criminal syndicates operating in the areas around [[id:1b91efee-b411-45a9-8b03-df967281885d][Nehet]] and [[id:c72ce3b7-f19e-4034-9df5-554bcddfaa4f][Mictlan]] that were rumoured to have ties with a secretive underworld wetwork firm. 

After smashing more than a few pirate dens, Imperial investigators learned that funds for the hit had been channelled via Silver Allied Network through Silver Universal Plc to an unknown group in [[id:9aad751b-a749-4fee-a990-d7da57714653][HR 706]]. 

Senator Lavigny’s request to pursue her investigation into [[id:9aad751b-a749-4fee-a990-d7da57714653][HR 706]] was originally met with refusal by members of Emperor’s Grace, who even went so far as to lodge an official protest with the Senate. Emperor’s Grace would later find themselves forced to acquiesce under orders issued by Senator Patreus. 

Now it looks like Emperor’s Grace had good reason to want the Princess kept out of the system, as late last night, new information came to light which has implicated the leadership of Emperor’s Grace in the attack on the Emperor. Senator Patreus is disavowing any knowledge of the incident, although he has so far refused to allow any members of Emperor’s Grace to be removed from [[id:9aad751b-a749-4fee-a990-d7da57714653][HR 706]]. 

Senator Lavigny will be formally presenting the evidence against Emperor’s Grace to the Senate tomorrow.
