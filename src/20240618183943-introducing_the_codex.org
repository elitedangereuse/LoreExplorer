* Introducing the Codex

/11 Dec 3304/

A new networked database system named the Codex has been released to the galactic community. 

The Codex is a joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographics, which issued the following joint statement: 

“We are pleased to announce that the Codex has been automatically uploaded to the onboard systems of all vessels registered with the Pilots Federation.” 

“The Commander section of the Codex collates all ship data, including the pilot’s personal achievements, while the Knowledge Base contains information on the galaxy’s most prominent organisations and individuals.” 

“The Discoveries section is designed to support deep-space exploration. As well as cataloguing stellar bodies and other phenomena, it also logs confirmed and unconfirmed findings from fellow explorers.” 

“We hope the Codex will prove valuable to all Commanders, and we look forward to it being updated with their findings.”
