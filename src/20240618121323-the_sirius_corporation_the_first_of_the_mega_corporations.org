The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] – The First of the Mega-corporations 
 
In this latest edition of GalNet’s series relating key points in human history, popular historian [[id:e13ec234-b603-4a29-870d-2b87410195ea][Sima Kalhana]] addresses the rise of the first mega-corporation. 

Apart from a few isolated backwater systems, the presence of mega-corporations is ubiquitous throughout civilised space. Massive as many of these organisations are, none of them compare to the wealth and influence of the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]]. 

The rise of the largest corporation in history started in 2339 when the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] launched the first completely corporate colonial mission arrived in the Sirius star system. The continual state of conflict between the Federation and the Empire catapulted the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corp.]]ration into an economic powerhouse as they became the lead supplier of fuel, then later drives and other technologies. 

Within a century, its products were integrated into military and civilian production. It also developed an envied trusted status with both superpowers and indeed supplied both sides during their conflicts. This in part was due to strict information restriction protocols and an open promise that it would favour neither side during any conflict. 

The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] developed its own code of strict laws to ensure fair dealing as well as the good governance of its workforce. Its influence reached such a state that the so-called ‘Sirius Convention’ was applied not just during deals with the corporation, but between independent systems as well. 

Throughout the years, fuel and drive production has remained their core business, although judicious expansion into other markets has driven its astronomical growth. The [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] now operates several product-oriented divisions including: Sirius Catering, Sirius Mining, Sirius Power, Sirius Luxury Transports, Sirius Industrial and Sirius Atmospherics. Most recently they launched a new venture, Sirius Gov, to provide governmental services for population management on all scales. 

Its history has been marked with some failures, most notable of which is the Antares incident which I will examine in the next article. However, its successes have far exceeded those failures and the [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] remains the most powerful corporation in known space.
