* [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] Receives Vital Aid

/14 Nov 3305/

The initiative in the [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system to provide the generation ship [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] with essential supplies has concluded successfully. 

A statement was provided by [[id:868d286f-de8c-40f7-9743-bbadc4d38423][Itsuko Harada]] of [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] Vision Incorporated: 

“Sincere thanks to all traders who delivered medicines and emergency supplies, and also to the brave pilots who protected these shipments against pirate raids. Transfer of the goods to the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] has concluded, and I understand they were accepted gratefully.” 

The medical supplies were accompanied by representatives of the Interstellar Health Organisation, who advised the colonists on their use. Team leader Dr Ivan Johansen commented: 

“Our antiviral agents are far more advanced than those on the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]], and early indications suggest patients are responding well to treatment. Hopefully we have halted the outbreak of what the colony calls ‘the wasting kiss’.” 

Reports from [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] government insiders indicate that communication with the [[id:fce1d147-f900-41ec-a92c-3ce3d1cae641][Golconda]] has become more frequent, particularly in regards to technological advancements. Local media coverage has fuelled public speculation that the colonists should abandon their ancient vessel and establish a new home in the system. 

Pilots who took part in the campaign can now obtain their rewards from Fozard Port in the [[id:361a46f2-79c4-40bf-9781-4066763914f3][Upaniklis]] system.
