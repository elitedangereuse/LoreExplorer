Core Dynamics is a giant conglomerate, best known as the galaxy's
premier manufacturers of weapon and surveillance systems and starships,
with a particular focus on combat vessels. Its product line ranges from
the diminutive Eagle to the gargantuan Farragut-class Battlecruiser, and
also includes the most popular skimmer in the galaxy, the S-4 Sentry.

The company is known for its occasional discount events, offering
reduced-cost ships either in celebration of a new design, or as
incentives for participation in a community endeavour.

Core Dynamics has a longstanding supply agreement with the Federation,
and is responsible for the Federal Assault Ship, Corvette, Dropship and
Gunship. As part of this relationship, the company benefits from
privileged access to Federal black-box data reserves, which it uses in
its research-and-development branch. In the ongoing quest for more
robust and effective ship designs, there is no substitute for data
gleaned from genuine combat encounters.
