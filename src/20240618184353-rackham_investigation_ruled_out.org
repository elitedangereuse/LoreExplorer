* Rackham Investigation Ruled Out

/12 Apr 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has denied that it is conducting a criminal investigation of [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]]. 

A spokesperson for the FIA gave the following statement: 

“Contrary to recent statements by the journalist [[id:2d151711-b41e-452d-88fc-9ec34e317af9][Bryanna Blanco]], we did not contact her seeking to obtain documentation, and are not running any investigation.” 

“There is no evidence of criminality within [[id:83c8d091-0fde-4836-b6bc-668b9a221207][Rackham Capital Investments]]. Our agency has received charitable donations from that organisation in the past, and Mr Rackham himself is a long-standing member of the FIA Civilian Oversight Board. Such a relationship would not be possible if we had any doubts about the integrity of Mr Rackham’s business dealings.” 

Bryanna Blanco published a response in [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“If this is true, then who were the FIA agents that visited our offices? I spoke to them personally and asked to see their credentials. Who has obtained our data regarding the criminal histories of [[id:e26683e6-6b19-4671-8676-f333bd5e8ff7][Zachary Rackham]] and many others?”
