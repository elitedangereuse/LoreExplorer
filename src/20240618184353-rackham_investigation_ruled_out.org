* Rackham Investigation Ruled Out

/12 Apr 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has denied that it is conducting a criminal investigation of Rackham Capital Investments. 

A spokesperson for the FIA gave the following statement: 

“Contrary to recent statements by the journalist Bryanna Blanco, we did not contact her seeking to obtain documentation, and are not running any investigation.” 

“There is no evidence of criminality within Rackham Capital Investments. Our agency has received charitable donations from that organisation in the past, and Mr Rackham himself is a long-standing member of the FIA Civilian Oversight Board. Such a relationship would not be possible if we had any doubts about the integrity of Mr Rackham’s business dealings.” 

Bryanna Blanco published a response in [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“If this is true, then who were the FIA agents that visited our offices? I spoke to them personally and asked to see their credentials. Who has obtained our data regarding the criminal histories of Zachary Rackham and many others?”
