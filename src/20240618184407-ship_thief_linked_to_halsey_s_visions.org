* Ship Thief Linked to Halsey’s Visions

/25 May 3305/

There has been much speculation about starship technician Gan Romero, whose dreams are believed to have directed him to steal a ship from a starport hangar. 

On the [[id:d06803e0-267c-4ffc-88f2-967058fce82e][Rewired]] network, independent journalist Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse offered this analysis: 

“Romero’s dream journal entries were very similar to Jasmina Halsey’s visions after the Starship One incident three years ago. Was this lowly grease monkey in touch with the same ‘caretakers of our galaxy’ that Halsey claims spoke to her?” 

“Sure, it could be coincidence. Maybe even a shared psychological disorder. But it seems possible that Halsey and Romero were telepathically contacted by the same incorporeal intelligence.” 

“You can see why they might want to talk to a Federal president. But a starport technician? What’s so special about Romero? If he’s telling the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] then who knows how many more ordinary people have heard these summons from ‘bodiless voices’ over the years?”
