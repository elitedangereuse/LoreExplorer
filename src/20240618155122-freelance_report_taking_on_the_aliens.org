* Freelance Report: Taking on the Aliens

/22 Nov 3302/

The Buckyball Racing Club is back with a new race, and this time it's taking on the aliens. 

Kick the Alien (and Run like Hell) is a 26-kilometre roundtrip SRV race. The event starts at the Noctrach-Ihazevich Research facility and involves driving to the nearby crash site, 'kicking the alien', and then driving back to the research facility as fast as possible. 

A representative for the Buckyball Racing Club said: "All other methods of interaction with the crash sites have failed to get a response â€“ perhaps this will wake them up". 

The race starts on Saturday the 26th of November and is expected to last for two weeks. Competitors can make their run at any time during this period, and can run as many times as they like.
