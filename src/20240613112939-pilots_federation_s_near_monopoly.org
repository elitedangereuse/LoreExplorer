* 0249 Pilots Federation's Near Monopoly
[[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Shinrarta Dezhra]]

Historically the [[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots Federation]] has been a trusted soure of
information for pilots. As humanity expanded into space that need for
informatiuon continued to grow.

Before 3100 they provided data for many ship and station
manufacturers. After 3100 in an understated, but effective campaign of
acqusitions and mergers they came the dominant provider of this data
as well as the hardware and software solutions serving that data.

From star chart data, ship data and bounty management systems the
Pilots Federation expanded their data sources to include markets,
newsfeeds and communication systems.

In 3300 the Pilots Federation's [[id:69222c4d-be04-4ece-aed7-3b7e5404820b][GalNet]] system has a near monopoly on
all shipboard and station embedded systems. The systems are fitted as
standard on nearly all independent ships and even some
militaries. It's a testament to the trusted nature of the PF that his
monopoly has occured with the little resistance bar some back room
negotiations.
