* Nuclear Weapon Stolen

/16 Feb 3305/

The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered that a nuclear weapon has been taken from an unregistered outpost. 

Senior Agent [[id:1900b0bf-bf32-4102-8cba-e9f2143ebedc][Rochelle Karim]] made the following statement: 

“Further examination of the outpost discovered last week confirms that it was home to unlicensed nuclear research. Personnel at the site were constructing a portable fusion warhead codenamed the [[id:070dd4b2-b839-41a8-8f99-e8f0b1e7db9f][Lucifer Device]].” 

“One operational prototype was produced, but we have failed to locate it. Our assumption is that whoever invaded the base now possesses a movable bomb with a 300 megaton yield – enough to destroy an entire city.” 

“This investigation is a top priority and we are exploring all available leads.”
