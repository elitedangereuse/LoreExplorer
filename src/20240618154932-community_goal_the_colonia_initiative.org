* Community Goal: The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Initiative

/18 Aug 3302/

The [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula is a relatively innocuous region of space encompassing the [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] system. It is also likely to become a major bastion of humanity in the years to come. 

Public interest in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula was piqued by the arrival in [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] of [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station, which dropped into the system after making an unsuccessful attempt to jump to [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]]. In the weeks that followed, pilots started ferrying goods to[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station to repair the damaged starport â€“ an initiative that captured the imagination of the galactic community. The region soon became a focus for those who fear that a war between the Federation and the Empire may be looming, and who hope to escape it. 

A coordinated campaign to establish a permanent outpost in the region, organised by the 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction, is already underway and a second is about to begin. The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has announced plans to establish an outpost in the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula, and has placed an open order for materials for use in the construction. 

A spokesperson for the organisation said: 

"A new beginning. A new tomorrow. That's what the [[id:ba6c6359-137b-4f86-ad93-f8ae56b0ad34][Colonia]] Nebula represents. A chance to create an interstellar community free from the internecine conflicts that blight so much of inhabited space. With your help, we can make it happen." 

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has promised to reward pilots who deliver titanium, semiconductors and robotics to [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station in the [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] system. The campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for two weeks.
