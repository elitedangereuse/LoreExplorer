* Taking the Fight Home

/20 Feb 3301/

Following the Federation's success in routing the rebel forces from Banki and BD+03 2338, [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]] has declared his intention to follow the invaders of BD+03 2338 back to their own homes. 

"I think the message is clear," [[id:478137a2-59fc-4055-ba37-021ef7035652][Admiral Vincent]] declared at press conference earlier today. "We will not allow terrorists to break our laws or brainwash our people. The Polahukuna Raiders, and those like them, need to learn that their actions have consequences. The Federation will not sit idly by and let the infections of chaos and anarchy spread and fester." 

The Admiral went on to say that he would reveal plans as to the nature of the Federation's foray into Polahukuna shortly.
