* Brewer Corporation deploying to assist Lantern Light station

/24 Mar 3311/

An unusual and turbulent situation has arisen for residents of the
station [[id:8c80dd52-03ca-46ed-889e-1c14a88ec1f9][Lantern Light]] in the [[id:be8dbc0b-879d-4269-a68c-7886b5d2953b][Lalande 25224]] system. The [[id:2547515c-389e-450d-893c-435b62436fc4][architect]], [[id:eddf9c84-ff9c-4a72-ac56-3269e8b47242][CMDR
Lavelain]], commissioned the station nearby a neutron star. However, the
station was inadvertently deployed deep within the star’s
gravitational well. As a result, the station’s movement and rotational
speeds far exceed safe limits – time should be taken for caution when
attempting docking.

[[id:d9459015-dae3-4233-9eb7-a2fb11344097][Brewer Corporation]] has received numerous requests for support from the
station’s residents and is mobilising to correct the station’s violent
and turbulent movement. The operation is currently undergoing careful
planning to ensure the orbit is not destabilized further into
catastrophe, and is expected to take several weeks to accomplish.
