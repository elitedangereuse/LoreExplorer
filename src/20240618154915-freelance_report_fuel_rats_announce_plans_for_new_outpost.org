* Freelance Report: Fuel Rats Announce Plans for New Outpost

/05 Aug 3302/

Earlier today, the [[id:78dc1804-9537-4e52-bba1-ca98efd86229][Fuel Rats Mischief]] announced plans for an
extraction outpost near [[id:935880a2-d4fb-4d27-ad48-0f95112ee0fe][Jaques Station]].

"We've been considering such a base for quite a while now. Originally
the idea was to set up near [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]] since it's one of the
regions most visited by explorers. The biggest challenge was always
supplying the station with commodities like food and spare
parts. Being near Jaques Station will solve this problem since it's
equipped with a habitation ring, and because it's a destination for a
steady stream of supply ships."

Asked if the fact that Jaques Station is already serving as a base
would render such an operation pointless, the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] spokesperson
answered:

"We fully expect Jaques to continue his journey at some point, and
since his station simply can't produce enough fuel to make that
possible, sooner or later an outpost will be necessary."
