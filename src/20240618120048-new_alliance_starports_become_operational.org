* New Alliance Starports Become Operational

/25 Jun 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

Two Alliance stations have been constructed following a successful re-election campaign by Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]]. 

Enterprise Market in the LHS 2522 system and Prosperity Core in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system are now fully operational. Prime Minister Mahon welcomed visitors to the new starports, promising that they would “further enhance the Alliance’s commitment to creating opportunities”. 

However, Councillor [[id:0d664f07-640e-4397-be23-6b52d2c2d4d6][Nakato Kaine]] triggered heated debate in the Alliance Assembly when she made this announcement: 

“My investigation turned up irregularities in the tritium mining campaign, suggesting that it only received enough deliveries to allow one starport to be built. Furthermore, docking records seem to indicate that [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] made up the shortfall with a number of unregistered donations.” 

“Sirius Corporation now has a presence in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system. This suggests disturbing parallels with the company’s recent dealings to help build [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]]’s new starports. The question is – what did Mahon promise in return?” 

A statement from the Office of the Prime Minister clarified that [[id:aae70cda-c437-4ffa-ac0a-39703b6aa15a][Sirius Corporation]] was one of many companies currently partnered with the Alliance to support its expansion programme. It did not address the discrepancy in tritium deliveries or refer to any contributions from the megacorp.
