* Arming Colonia

/02 Mar 3304/

Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has launched a campaign to boost Colonia’s military strength by providing the region with weapons. The initiative is a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility. 

A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation elaborated on the nature of the campaign: 

“Several members of our organisation have friends and family in Colonia, so we’ve decided to divert some cash into protecting the region. If the Thargoids come knocking, we don’t want the people of Colonia to be caught with their pants down.” 

Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has placed an open order for a range of weapons, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Gold Hub in the Arek system. 

The campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
