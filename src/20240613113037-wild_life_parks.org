Dr. [[id:246ac86d-4a96-4fdc-907d-d8a84b142e70][Lewis Chapman]], CEO of [[id:d20f91af-3196-4258-ad57-64c7c61e5ed9][Starship Enterprises]], once took a small
company of bio engineers under his corporations wing and then, he fell
in love with their idea. This company was called the Terran Wild-Life
Project. The small team had managed to get their hands on some genetic
data, purchased from the [[id:46747998-bad6-4f84-80d3-f551fdcbdfe3][Mother Gaia]] democratic party in [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]. The data
was a genetic library of Earth species of animals. The teams idea was
to clone the animals for release onto newly terraformed planets across
the galaxy. The animals would be gene tailored to suit their new
environments and selected so that they would fit in with the new
ecosystems. Although the company still retains its original ethos,
Dr. Chapman has overhauled them in a much bigger project. Not only do
they provide the CEO with his own private supply of horses on his
ranch on So-Yeon Planet, but they have also been working on large
scale game reserves on Whitson Planet. These sprawling reserves are
full of a variety of animals from Earths history, everything from
birds of prey to humpback whales. The projects aim is to generate
touirsm in Lp 339-7. So far the venture seems to be a raging success.
