Dr. Lewis Chapman, CEO of Starship Enterprises, once took a small company of bio engineers under his corporations wing and then, he fell in love with their idea. This company was called the Terran Wild-Life Project. The small team had managed to get their hands on some genetic data, purchased from the Mother Gaia democratic party in Sol. The data was a genetic library of Earth species of animals. The teams idea was to clone the animals for release onto newly terraformed planets across the galaxy. The animals would be gene tailored to suit their new environments and selected so that they would fit in with the new ecosystems. Although the company still retains its original ethos, Dr. Chapman has overhauled them in a much bigger project. Not only do they provide the CEO with his own private supply of horses on his ranch on So-Yeon Planet, but they have also been working on large scale game reserves on Whitson Planet. These sprawling reserves are full of a variety of animals from Earths history, everything from birds of prey to humpback whales. The projects aim is to generate touirsm in Lp 339-7. So far the venture seems to be a raging success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
