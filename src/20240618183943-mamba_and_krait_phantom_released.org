* Mamba and Krait Phantom Released

/11 Dec 3304/

Two new ships marketed towards independent pilots, the [[id:7e5ca3fc-34b8-4987-9873-74e9266ffc9f][Mamba]] and the [[id:2ac8fefa-cef4-4def-b737-cd784dd1a9c5][Krait Phantom]], have just hit the market. 

[[id:d24ee8f5-e2ec-4c71-b5fa-afc2d9710141][Zorgon Peterson]] issued the following press release for its new vessel: 

“If it’s speed and firepower you want, the Mamba is for you. Based on a racing prototype, it’s the fastest commercially available starship, and it sports enough hardpoints for a range of devastating weaponry. Whether you’re leaving competitors in the dust or running rings around those pesky Thargoids, think Mamba!” 

Faulcon DeLacy also released a statement for its latest design: 

“The Krait Phantom offers true multi-role capability, allowing it to be customised for combat, mining or trading. And for explorers, its impressive jump range means you really can reach out to the stars. This is a ship that can handle it all.”
