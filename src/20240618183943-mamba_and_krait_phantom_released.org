* Mamba and Krait Phantom Released

/11 Dec 3304/

Two new ships marketed towards independent pilots, the Mamba and the Krait Phantom, have just hit the market. 

Zorgon Peterson issued the following press release for its new vessel: 

“If it’s speed and firepower you want, the Mamba is for you. Based on a racing prototype, it’s the fastest commercially available starship, and it sports enough hardpoints for a range of devastating weaponry. Whether you’re leaving competitors in the dust or running rings around those pesky Thargoids, think Mamba!” 

Faulcon DeLacy also released a statement for its latest design: 

“The Krait Phantom offers true multi-role capability, allowing it to be customised for combat, mining or trading. And for explorers, its impressive jump range means you really can reach out to the stars. This is a ship that can handle it all.”
