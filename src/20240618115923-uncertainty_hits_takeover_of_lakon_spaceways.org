* Uncertainty Hits Takeover of [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]]

/15 Jan 3307/

The purchase of shipbuilding company [[id:906c77b7-7fe4-48c1-ace5-1265023c2ebf][Lakon Spaceways]] by [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]] is in doubt after allegations of illegal business practices. 

Irfan Karim reported on the recent developments for The Alliance Tribune: 

“The Independent Commission for Market Equality has confirmed that several Lakon shareholders sold their stock to shell companies, which were covertly established by departments within [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]]. Furthermore, two serious accusations of blackmail have been referred to Alliance Interpol.” 

[[id:88ac1950-caa0-4043-96c0-07e33ca7c049][Trent Delaney]], Lakon’s newly installed chairperson, has dismissed these claims. But coupled with serious rumblings from the Council of Admirals over losing a military supplier, this hostile takeover now looks less certain.” 

In the Federation, the newsfeed [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] Today ran an editorial piece on the situation: 

“Acquiring Lakon is another bold triumph for manufacturing colossus [[id:4a28463f-cbed-493b-9466-70cbc6e19662][Core Dynamics]]. It’s a shame that it’s being undermined by the petty bureaucrats of the Alliance, who should be gratefully grasping this financial lifeline.” 

“It’s also laughable that CEO [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]], one of our titans of industry, is being stabbed in the back by old-fashioned colleagues who are clearly jealous of his success. Perhaps his ‘Jupiter Division’ has finally outgrown the corporation and deserves to forge its own path.”
