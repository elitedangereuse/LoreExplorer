* 0181 The Birthright Wars
[[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]

Between 2621 and 2735, Federal member systems underwent a period of
societal change. The original colonial charters of many settlements
granted hereditary land and position to families descended from their
original settlers. Many of these birthright claims extended across
vast areas of land and encompassed massive resources. The old charters
became a hindrance especially to corporations who wanted access to
these assets and gradually more and more pressure came to bear on the
presidential administration to take action against this 'stifling
anachrinism'.

The Birthright Wars were the name given to a series of conflicts that
resulted in the forced acquisition or redistribution of hereditary
rights (depending on your viewpoint) from colonial pioneers to
corporations who had necessary technology to exploit these regions. It
was generally blamed on corporate greed at the time, but notably the
Federal Navy stood by.
