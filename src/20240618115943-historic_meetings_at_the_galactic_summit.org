* Historic Meetings at the Galactic Summit

/26 Feb 3307/

Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders have held their first ever face-to-face discussions at the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system. 

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling published this report for Vox Galactica: 

“The Galactic Summit has already made history by bringing together many political figureheads within one conference chamber. Optimistic opening statements from Chancellor [[id:e9679720-e0c1-449e-86a6-a5b3de3613f5][Anders Blaine]] and Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] gained applause. President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] was more curt, reminding everyone that billions of people would be affected by their efforts.” 

“Agendas and debate topics for the next three weeks were formalised. Much of the work will be done behind the scenes by ambassadorial staff, making big decisions in small rooms.” 

“The general tone so far has been courteous, although that may not last. Predictably, interactions between the Imperial and Marlinist delegations have been frosty, with Senator [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] refusing to even acknowledge their presence during discussions.” 

“However, First Minister Jenna Fairfax enjoyed a more cordial meeting with Shadow President Felicia Winters. They were joined by Jasmina Halsey, who has accompanied Winters from Mars in an unofficial capacity.” 

“One notable absentee was Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, whose family is under legal scrutiny following the crimes of his older brother [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]]. This at least spared Jordan the awkwardness of having to formally greet his ex-fiancée, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]. But it’s likely there will be no shortage of tension between other delegates in the coming weeks.”
