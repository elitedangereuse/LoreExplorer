* 0251 Pilots Federation's Secrecy
[[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Shinrarta Dezhra]]

Much of what the [[id:131aabdf-0ed8-4ce2-beec-94c77a8c41d2][Pilots Federation]] does revolves around [[id:6ad7e1e4-4fb0-4cbf-b9a1-771afa67ed0b][secrecy]]; and
this has many layers. Within the Pilots Federation, the [[id:29d1e8f4-004d-4d0f-b838-265c302d8187][Elite
Federation]] of Pilots is even more mysterious and secretive, and at the
centre of that is the elusive '[[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Founders World]]'.

It is the only system directly controlled by the EFP, and even its
location is closely guarded. The secrecy is maintained by the EFP
using 'misinformation' - there are a great many rumours of its rough
location - and they all contradict each other. Only a select few - the
members of the EFP - know the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]].

The system is governed by the EFP and it is here that the
organisation's headquarters is based.

EFP members are allowed to retire here in relative anonymity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
