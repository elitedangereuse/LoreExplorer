* Galactic News: The [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] Situation

/26 Aug 3303/

Although the first hints of the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] presence began with the discovery of Unknown Artefacts in 3301, the current chapter in the Thargoid story started last year with the discovery of alien shipwrecks in the Pleiades Nebula. A few months later, in January 3303, the first interdiction from a Thargoid ship was reported. 

In May, accounts surfaced of attacks in the Maia system against Federal vessels. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] ships at the sites, but [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] refused to comment on the possibility of Thargoid involvement. 

A key discovery was made a few weeks later, when massive [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] structures were found in a number of systems. Several of these structures were discovered to contain functional Thargoid technology. 

With events unfolding at such a rapid pace, the superpowers have struggled to formulate appropriate responses. But the creation of Aegis, a joint-superpower initiative designed to coordinate research into the Thargoids, suggests that the galaxy’s leaders are now taking steps to address the situation. 

Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute, offered the following assessment: 

“We are faced with a number of pressing questions. Why have the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] entered human space? Can we communicate with them? Are they hostile? Hopefully Aegis can provide us with some answers.” 

Meanwhile, in an article for the Imperial Herald, journalist Kelvin Masters gave a more frank analysis: 

“The barnacles seem to indicate that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] were in Maia and Merope long before we were. For all we know, humanity has expanded into what the Thargoids see as their territory. I have no interest in scaremongering, but my belief is that a [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] attack could be imminent – their behaviour certainly seems to suggest they are probing us for weaknesses.”
