* Galactic News: [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Speaks

/30 Jun 3302/

Following news that [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station has been found in the [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]] system,[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] has broadcast a message to the media, having apparently restored communications at his starport: 

"First, I'd like to thank all the pilots who came looking for me." 

"As for what happened, well...I guess it was a little ambitious to try to jump all the way to Beagle Point. As soon as I entered witch-space, it was clear something was up with the drive engines. And the navigation system. And the power distributor." 

"Pretty soon I realised I had a choice – push on to Beagle Point and arrive as a cloud of shrapnel, or drop into the nearest safe system. I made the only choice I could – to push on. Then I came to my senses and decided to drop into [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]]." 

[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] was asked if he would be making another attempt to reach Beagle Point. 

"I don't think [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station will be jumping again anytime soon. The old girl wasn't really built for long-distance travel, and the last leap put a lot of strain on the superstructure. I think I'm going to be in Eol Prou whatever-it's-called for the foreseeable future. Still, the view here is lovely, so it could be worse." 

In related news, various members of the galactic community have begun collecting meta-alloys to repair [[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station, and will soon depart for [[id:5f3c361b-30be-4912-8341-f6f3c1336028][Eol Prou RS-T d3-94]].
