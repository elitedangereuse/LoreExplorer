* New Computer Designs Announced

/17 Aug 3304/

Federal Times journalist [[id:81ba02cb-f405-4079-9207-63afc71263df][Harlow Nassry]] has highlighted two new personal computer designs currently in development: 

“For a long time, the [[id:83f24d98-a30b-4917-8352-a2d0b4f8ee65][Sirius]] and Achilles corporations have been the main suppliers of personal computing devices, but two smaller companies are aiming to challenge that monopoly.” 

“The first company, [[id:3e9f43fb-038f-46a6-be53-3c9af1bad474][Supratech]], is working on a revolutionary design called the Torc, a flexible ring that coils around the user’s wrist or neck. It uses high-resolution holographic projectors to surround the user with illuminated displays and motion-sensitive interfaces.” 

“The second company, [[id:46e9f326-2119-4d5b-a625-a32820a44642][Herculean Machines]], has taken a more down-to-earth approach. The Duradrive is a chunky, durable tablet designed to withstand rough handling. Herculean has promised a range of peripherals, allowing users to custom-build their own version of the device.” 

“Both companies plan to reveal prototypes of their designs at a technology expo in October. But can the market support two rival products? We’ll no doubt be hearing more about the Torc and Duradrive in the near future.”
