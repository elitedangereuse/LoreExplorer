* Aegis Leader Opposes Salvation

/05 Nov 3307/

Admiral [[id:7bca1ccd-649e-438a-ae56-fb8ca34e6440][Aden Tanner]] has called for Aegis to reject the public inquiry’s shutdown and take direct action against Salvation. 

The Musashi, an Aegis Defense megaship under his command, has entered the T Tauri system to challenge Taurus Mining Ventures. The corporation has performed activities on Salvation’s behalf, including preparation for the anti-xeno weapon used to eliminate all [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] from the Cornsar system. 

Admiral Tanner transmitted this message to media outlets: 

“Salvation’s unlicensed weapons technology is deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives. My sources tell me that Hind Mine asteroid base contains evidence of this. I therefore demand that Taurus Mining Ventures allows us access so we can determine the truth.” 

Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures responded: 

“We are a legitimate business under contract to a private citizen, whose activities are protected by confidentiality agreements. These threats have no legal standing and are not welcome.” 

Admiral Tanner is a highly decorated Federal Navy officer and Aegis’s chief military liaison, having coordinated many combat efforts against the Thargoids. The Musashi’s relocation has been condemned by Aegis leadership, and Tanner has been ordered to depart the T Tauri system.
