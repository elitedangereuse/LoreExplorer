* 0115 Alioth History
[[id:5c4e0227-24c0-4696-b2e1-5ba9fe0308f5][Alioth]]

After the war between [[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]] and the Federation concluded in 2380,
the Federation looked to find new resources elsewhere. In 2398, the
first of a new wave of colonial missions was sent to the outermost
sectors in the opposite direction to the Empire and Lave.

Alioth was colonised in 2452. Survey data and reports had already
indicated the rich resources of the system before settlement, but the
resources proved richer than expected.

The first colonial settlement in the system was known as 'Fruitcake',
the name given owing to the loamy consistency of the planetary surface
and its propensity for small mineral deposits.
