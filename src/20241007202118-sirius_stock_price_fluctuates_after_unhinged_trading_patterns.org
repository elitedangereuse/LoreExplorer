* Sirius Stock Price Fluctuates After ‘Unhinged’ Trading Patterns

/03 Sep 3310/

Recent moves by Sirius Corporation have resulted in an uncharacteristic wobble in stock prices, according to Money Matters. 

In an exclusive story, economist Roberta Unwin has revealed increasingly aggressive attempts by Li Yong-Rui to initiate a corporate takeover of Achilles Aerospace. Thus far, these attempts have proven unsuccessful. 

Unwin went on to say: 

“The current darling of the technology world, Achilles is riding a wave of momentum following the release of the SCO Frame Shift Drive. This breakthrough risks dislodging Sirius’s monopoly on FSD technology for the first time in over a decade. According to my sources, Li is increasingly unhappy with the challenge to his dominance of the aerospace industry.” 

“I’ve heard phenomenal numbers when detailing Sirius’s multiple offers to purchase Achilles Aerospace and its proprietary SCO designs. Maxine Patro remains unswayed and has kept Achilles’ board members on her side. A company insider described Li’s obsession with Achilles as ‘unhinged’.” 

“Sirius Corporation has recently acquired several smaller corporations across the core systems, most of which relate to aerospace and technological research. But a perceived lack of short-term strategy has unnerved some investors, with this week’s 3.9% share price drop costing the megacorp trillions.” 

In recent weeks Sirius Corporation has sought to pressure Pranav Antal and the Utopia community into forging stronger links, with Li described as ‘enthusiastic’ about gaining access to Utopia’s advanced technological prototypes. Pranav Antal has warned that Sirius personnel are not welcome in Utopian communes, claiming to distrust Li’s motives. 

“Then again,” says Unwin, “It's hard to bet against Sirius Corporation for long. Li Yong-Rui is accustomed to getting what he wants eventually.”
