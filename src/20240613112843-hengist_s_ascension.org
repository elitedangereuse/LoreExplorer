* 0151 Hengist's Ascension
[[id:bed8c27f-3cbe-49ad-b86f-7d87eacf804a][Achenar]]

In 3233, [[id:3cb0755e-4deb-442b-898b-3f0c6651636e][Hengist Duval]] ascended to the throne. His coronation,
broadcast throughout the Empire, gave the impression of a serene
transition. However, behind the veneer lay tensions. The Imperial
Senate had gained considerable power in the last years of [[id:8dc482e7-e978-4e6e-8a63-600e61cd715f][Hesketh]]'s
reign. The first decade of Hengist's rule was tense as the new Emperor
struggled to assert himself and repopulate his court with individuals
he considered personally loyal.
