* The Liberation of HIP 17692

/12 Jan 3304/

In a move that has come as a surprise to many, [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] and Federation have announced a joint initiative to counter Thargoid activity in the HIP 17692 system. 

The two-pronged operation will seek to reduce the Thargoid presence in the region, and to recover personal effects, data and people from Thargoid attack sites in HIP 17692. 

The Merope Expeditionary Fleet has been authorised to oversee the combat operation, while The Pleiades Resource Enterprise has been charged with coordinating the rescue initiative. Pilots who support these campaigns will be eligible for substantial rewards. 

Following the announcement, Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] released the following statement: 

“Starports throughout the Pleiades have been attacked. Thousands of lives have been lost. And we have failed to deliver an effective response. That changes now.” 

“This is your chance to deliver a message to our enemies – to tell them that we will not yield and we will not break. We will fight!” 

The campaign begins on the 11th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
