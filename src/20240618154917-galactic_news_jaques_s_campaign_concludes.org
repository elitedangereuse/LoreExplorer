* Galactic News: Jaques's Campaign Concludes

/10 Aug 3302/

Personnel at Jaques Station have announced that their appeal for repair materials has reached a successful conclusion more than a week before the campaign was scheduled to end, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. 

Thousands of pilots are understood to have contributed to the initiative, in some cases making multiple trips to the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. 

In a brief statement, Jaques said: 

"The station might have looked fine from the outside, but things definitely weren't running smoothly on the inside. But thanks to you guys we should have most systems running pretty soon." 

Jaques went on to announce that the station's roster of services would be extended to include a shipyard, although he did not disclose which vessels would be available. Discussions with manufacturers are understood to be underway.
