[[id:7075359f-79ca-4a24-88da-64f22e6b024a][Ackwada]]

The election of Grant Keller in 2976 saw a change tp Federal policy. Under Keller's administration, corporate investment and involvement in all aspects of Federation society increased dramatically. Recognising the need to restore the financial reserves to the administration which had been utterly exhausted by the previous military expenditures of the last century. / Keller's tenure came to and end in 2984 and Federal policy returned to previous ways. A Federally-supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial fifth fleet in 2986.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
