* 0192 Grant Keller's Election
[[id:77a7a843-4242-4da8-a764-c1525e6ceefe][Ackwada]]

The election of [[id:dd3d131b-d60c-41fe-94c8-b850622bb22a][Grant Keller]] in 2976 saw a change tp Federal
policy. Under Keller's administration, corporate investment and
involvement in all aspects of Federation society increased
dramatically. Recognising the need to restore the financial reserves
to the administration which had been utterly exhausted by the previous
military expenditures of the last century.

Keller's tenure came to and end in 2984 and Federal policy returned to
previous ways. A Federally-supported coup in the Ackwada system was
ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial fifth fleet in 2986.
