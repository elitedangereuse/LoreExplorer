* Galactic News: Winged Hussars Appeal Comes to an End

/06 Oct 3303/

A spokesperson for the Winged Hussars has announced that its appeal for rare liquors was enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Zander Dock, the organisation’s base of operations. 

A spokesperson for the Winged Hussars has issued the following statement: 

“I would like to thank the galactic community for its help, and assure them that their work will bring new business opportunities to this remote region of space. The border colonies are grateful for your efforts, Commanders!” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Zander Dock in the HIP 110028 system.
