* The Assault on Leigong

/15 Mar 3310/

*Pilots’ Federation Alert* 

Titan Leigong is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of a second Titan. 

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships: 

• Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – To break through the maelstrom defence wave. 

• Caustic Sink Launchers – To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom. 

• Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon – To hamper the Titan’s vents and make it vulnerable to damage. 

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat. 

Good luck, Commanders.
