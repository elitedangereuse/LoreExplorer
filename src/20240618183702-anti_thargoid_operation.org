* Anti-Thargoid Operation

/23 Feb 3304/

Following the success of last month’s Federal-Imperial operation in the HIP 17692 system, the two superpowers have once again joined forces to combat the Thargoids. 

This time, the operation will focus on the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems, where large concentrations of Thargoid ships have been reported. 

The purpose of the two-pronged operation is to reduce the Thargoid presence in Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7, and to recover black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites in Arietis Sector XE-Z b4. The former initiative is being overseen by the Merope Expeditionary Fleet, while the latter is being coordinated by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise. Pilots who support these operations will be eligible for substantial rewards. 

Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] launched the campaign with the following statement: 

“We know that militias of experienced combat pilots are particularly effective against the Thargoids, but we must not be complacent. Our enemies are formidable, and we underestimate them at our peril.” 

The campaign begins on the 22nd of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
