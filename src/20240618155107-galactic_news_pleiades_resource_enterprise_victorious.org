* Galactic News: Pleiades Resource Enterprise Victorious

/01 Nov 3302/

Recent reports from [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] indicate that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has successfully overcome resistance from the Ant Hill Mob to gain a foothold in the system. 

A spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise released a brief statement: 

"The Ant Hill Mob believes our expansion into [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] was orchestrated by Federal officials, but I think they're just looking for a way of explaining their defeat. In war, it's the stronger side that wins. Simple as that. We may be aligned with the Federation, but we were acting on our own behalf." 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from [[id:0ee60994-364c-41b9-98ca-993d041cea72][Maia]] Point in the Maia system.
