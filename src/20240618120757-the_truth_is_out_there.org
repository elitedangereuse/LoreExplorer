* The Truth is Out There

/28 May 3301/

Despite claims that the disappearance of [[id:85fdc9c8-500b-4e91-bc8b-70bcb3c05b0f][Starship One]] was due to a
failure in the ship’s [[id:46a9c980-af48-4e43-a820-9971d7c76c34][Frame Shift Drive]], rumours abound about a more
sinister, possibly [[id:193cf057-7f74-4842-b9a8-af825a04e7e6][extraterrestrial]] explanation.

[[id:5e79a148-ff1a-4c85-86b0-2806717305f9][Alex Snoori]], host of the popular interstellar talk show [[id:a11cc610-f74a-48e8-9e8c-66fd61dda4a2][Beyond Top
Secret]], had this to say to his listeners.

“It’s an outrage, that’s what it is. Do you think those [[id:8a55a32e-316d-469b-a19f-bdc7c4d4b018][Martian]] fat
cats that rule over us want you to know the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]]? I don’t think so.”

“Learn your history, people. It wasn’t all that long ago that our
ancestors were being plucked out of the black right into the belly of
bugs. Wake up sheeple, you don’t want to be sitting around dressed up
like mutton when they come for you. Do not let the government tell you
lies. You’re smarter than that.”

“There’s been a lot of hullabaloo about strange things being found out
there recently. Weird, [[id:cfdeda2f-8828-4acb-8cd1-9e9a63f3f6b2][pulsing]], [[id:860ffa72-12a1-44d6-bca5-d7c2cdc29a44][alien]] things. I don’t know where they
came from, but I do know that they’re creepy, and gross, and almost
certainly [[id:25ff0dde-fc05-403d-8f81-599fbfee75e5][dangerous]]. You think it’s a coincidence that the [[id:a9ccf59f-436e-44df-b041-5020285925f8][President]]
went missing just weeks after those THINGS turn up? Don’t be so
naive. WAKE UP sheeple, you’re being lied to.”
