* 0134  Wrekcht's Raid
[[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]]

In 2913, former Imperial Commander Maximillian Wrekcht attempted to
raid the banking vaults on the Trouble in the [[id:929ff6f9-0c6c-4a07-ad87-0fb67def4f0e][Andceeth]] system. Whilst
Wrekcht was a retired Commander of the Fifth Imperial fleet, his
actions under an Imperial letter of marque left no doubts to his
affiliation. Working from an Imperial cruiser with a prototype engine
mask, Wrekcht's audacious attempt to bombard the planet with asteroids
was foiled by Federal defence forces. He was believed to have died in
the ensuing battle.
