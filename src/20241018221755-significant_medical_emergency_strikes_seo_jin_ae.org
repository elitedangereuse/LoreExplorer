* 'Significant Medical Emergency’ Strikes [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]]

/18 Oct 3310/

[[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]], special advisor to the [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] initiative, has suffered a
‘significant medical emergency’ according to reports from the [[id:b16e9508-ccde-4a48-86ff-f3674c9c720e][Duamta]]
system.

A [[id:11416cf5-f6f1-47c6-a086-abfc7d3fddc4][leak]] from within the [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] medical facility reached media outlets
early yesterday evening, claiming that [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]] had suddenly fallen
ill. The source also claimed that Seo was registering incredibly high
brain activity while [[id:ad3a5cb7-c1d7-4315-8fec-d6d01fa17a68][unconscious]].

The intense speculation resulted in a surprise response from Head of
Aegis, [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], only hours later.

Her brief statement was delivered by a spokesperson outside the
facility to gathered journalists:

“While it is unfortunate that a member of our staff decided to [[id:11416cf5-f6f1-47c6-a086-abfc7d3fddc4][leak]]
this information, the news is true. I have chosen to confirm the
claims myself, rather than let speculation and falsehoods grow about
[[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]]’s condition.”

“Approximately sixteen hours ago, Seo experienced a generalized
[[id:8d9f2e07-6bf4-42c6-af82-d998781b0b19][tonic-clonic]] [[id:aed92336-77df-433d-9c6d-3721cfa224d5][seizure]]. The convulsions stopped within a few minutes,
but she is yet to wake. [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] medical experts are providing the best
possible care as they determine the cause of this episode.”

“Until then, please allow the staff here to do what they do best
without distraction from those hungry for information. We will provide
an update on Seo when there is something to share.”

Seo is known for her unique ability to interpret Thargoid
communications, due to a prototype cortical [[id:4134dd16-1d78-4ba0-8f80-e351325393c8][implant]] installed during
the [[id:4668be49-dfb5-4946-ac42-e74530553fd9][Project Seraph]] experiments. It is believed that her insight has
proven highly valuable to Aegis tactical briefings, but Seo’s level of
involvement has never been fully detailed.
