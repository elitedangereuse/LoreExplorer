* Freelance Report: Mysterious Wreck could be an Artefact of the Past

/01 Sep 3302/

The discovery of what appears to be the remains of a non-human spacecraft has sent ripples of fear and curiosity through the galaxy. 

"Many are speculating that this is evidence of recent Thargoid activity," said Professor Steven Eisler of the Okinura Xenobiology Institute, "but it's more likely that the wreckage dates from our first encounters with the Thargoids." 

"What I find disturbing are the messages and clues that led to this xeno-archaeological find. Someone is deliberately preying on mankind's fear of the unknown, and they need to be held accountable for their actions."
