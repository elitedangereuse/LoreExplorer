* Mining Campaign Success for Zemina Torval

/26 Aug 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Torval-Mastopolos Mining initiative in the LTT 198 system has outperformed Wreaken Construction’s rival campaign. 

Pilots delivered mined resources to the megaships Pride of Bitterwood and Tobias’s Gift to support the competing corporations. Ultimately, it was the new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that received the greatest quantities. 

Senator Zemina Torval provided a statement to Imperial media: 

“This is an auspicious beginning for my new enterprise. I am pleased to offer rewards to my supporters at the Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system.”  

In addition to credits, the top 75% of Torval’s supporters will be provided with an experimental mining laser and permanent permit access to LTT 198. 

Constantia Torval, one of the senator’s daughters, has assumed the role of director of operations with Torval-Mastopolos Mining. There has been no comment from the Mastopolos family regarding the subsidiary, which is being run autonomously by Zemina Torval. 

CEO Emmerich Koenig confirmed that Wreaken Construction will soon withdraw from LTT 198. Pilots who supported its efforts can now claim reimbursement from Tobias’s Gift in the EGM 559 system. The top 10% of Koenig’s supporters will receive an experimental abrasion blaster as well. 

LTT 198 State Ltd has reinstated permit control for entry to the LTT 198 system. A new starport will shortly be constructed and administered by Torval-Mastopolos Mining.
