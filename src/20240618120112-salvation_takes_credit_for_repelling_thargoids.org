* [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] Takes Credit for Repelling Thargoids

/22 Sep 3307/

The anonymous ‘man of science’ [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]] has claimed responsibility for the Thargoids’ unexplained departure from the Cornsar system. 

Salvation had predicted their attack, but his claim was discounted by Aegis and other authorities. After a few days the Thargoid vessels fled abruptly, leaving behind wreckages across the system. 

The following message was transmitted on public channels: 

“This is [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]. The Thargoid invasion of Cornsar has now been repulsed, thanks to prototype anti-xeno weaponry that I have been developing for some time. I have achieved what Aegis could not – an effective deterrent against the alien threat.” 

“Refinement of this weapon is at a critical stage, so I cannot reveal any details. I only regret that my warning was not heeded in time to save everyone on the two starports.” 

“This triumph was only possible thanks to those loyal pilots who answered my call. Rewards will shortly be available from the Bright Sentinel megaship in the Mbooni system.” 

Salvation’s identity and capabilities remain unknown, but he has established a reputation as a rival to Aegis. He is also knowledgeable about Azimuth Biochemicals, a research company connected to the earliest recorded encounters with Guardian and Thargoid artefacts.
