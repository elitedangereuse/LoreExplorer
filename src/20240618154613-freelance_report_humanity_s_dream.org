* Freelance Report: Humanity's Dream

/12 Apr 3302/

On this date 1,341 years ago, humanity achieved a dream it had harboured for generations. For the first time, advanced rocket technology propelled a human being beyond the boundaries of Earth and into space. 

To commemorate [[id:6354fe85-15c7-4a7c-b2dc-3226d1eb9115][Yuri Gagarin]]'s historic flight, pilots gather every year at the M. Gorbachev starport in the [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]] system from 18.00 UST onwards to swap first-flight stories and buy rounds at Tereshkova's Hangout. A member of station personnel said: 

"For some, it's quite a pilgrimage. We've had pilots from [[id:aa43803c-e60c-45bf-ab48-49a139931c68][Sothis]], [[id:61687e51-580b-43d7-993e-0dd100f82804][Quince]], Fehu and [[id:35900507-bc1d-4030-a8ee-39b439bba2ed][Canopus]] in previous years. People want to see the cradle of humanity and remember the moment when the dream of touching the stars was realised. It's a time for looking back and looking forward. We spent many millennia dreaming that dream, and it's been just over a thousand years since we achieved it."
