* Alliance Consolidates Presence in Coalsack Nebula

/26 Nov 3306/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Alliance has opened new starports in the Coalsack Nebula, and is offering high prices for Thargoid-related commodities.  

Following a successful campaign to establish a foothold in the nebula, the Alliance has announced that several new starports have become operational. These are: 

Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system. 

Cole Point in the Coalsack Sector VU-0 B6-6 system. 

Hannu Arena in the Musca Dark Region IM-V C2-24 system. 

Bering Port in the Coalsack Sector KN-S B4-9 system. 

The starports will serve as launchpads for further exploration of the region. Several corporations are working in partnership with the Alliance to locate commercial and scientific sites of interest. 

One of the new research stations, Betancourt Base, has requested deliveries of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] commodities. Chief xenobiologist Dr Rodion Stathos outlined the offer: 

“The [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] have been in the Coalsack Nebula for at least two hundred years, giving us an opportunity to increase our understanding of this alien species. Thanks to funding provided by pharmaceutical and bioengineering companies, we can offer generous rewards for shipments of [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] biological matter and other artefacts.”
