* Author Begins Interstellar Book Tour

/05 Jul 3304/

Celebrated author [[id:103de6dd-c4ec-4687-8b3c-24f57fa309f7][Olav Redcourt]] has begun a promotional tour, visiting over fifty destinations throughout the core systems.  

His new novel, ‘Corsair King and the Storm of Desire’, is the fourteenth in a series of swashbuckling historical romances set in the 27th century. A press release from Bonespire Publishing stated: 

“After many months of waiting, the next book in [[id:103de6dd-c4ec-4687-8b3c-24f57fa309f7][Olav Redcourt]]’s pulse-pounding series is at last on sale. To mark the occasion, we have organised an epic tour so that loyal readers can meet the creator of the Corsair King, Lady Lastday, Roughkiss and all their other favourite characters. The tour will begin in the Blatrimpe system and conclude two months later in Procyon.” 

“As with all releases from Bonespire Publishing, readers will be able to customise the holo-novel to enhance their reading pleasure. Our easy-to-use controls allow the reader to revise narrative structure, vocabulary and characterisation, and the plotline will have multiple option points, enabling you to determine an ending that meets your tastes.” 

An independent reporter approached Mr Redcourt as he was boarding a passenger liner, but was only able to record a few short statements. These included “bounced across space like a damn human pinball” and “nothing but meat for the sausage factory”. 

The author’s agent, Margaux Hist, told the media: 

“I wouldn’t pay much attention to that. Olav was probably just thinking aloud while developing a new character.”
