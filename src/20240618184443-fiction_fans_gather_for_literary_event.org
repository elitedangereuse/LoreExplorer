* Fiction Fans Gather for Literary Event

/16 Aug 3305/

A celebration of literature at H.G. Wells Terminal in the Olgrea system is the focus of the fourth week of [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] Festival of Culture. 

Leyton Farris reported on the event for [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][The Alliance]] Tribune: 

“Devotees of both modern and classic fiction have gathered to celebrate a shared love of literature and meet their favourite authors. The event is also an opportunity for writers to promote their work and attract new readers.” 

“One highlight has been local author Hanna Darrold releasing a novel titled ‘Chronicles of Olgrea’. The book concerns a local author releasing a novel during a literature festival, and has become an instant bestseller in the metafiction category.” 

Fans of the wildly popular Corsair King series expressed hope for an appearance by Olav Redcourt, but he remains in seclusion working on his science fiction novel. A spokesperson for Bonespire Publishing suggested “Redcourt is risking financial ruin by trying to resuscitate a dead genre – nobody reads science fiction anymore.”
