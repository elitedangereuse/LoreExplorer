* Galactic News: Galactic Authorities Call for Calm

/18 Nov 3303/

As reports continue to pour in of Thargoid attacks, the galaxy’s leaders have issued statements urging the public to remain calm. 

In a missive released to a number of news feeds, Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] said: 

“It is true that the Thargoids represent a pertinent threat, but it is important that we understand the scale of this threat. At present, they are active only in the Pleiades Nebula, and there is no reason to believe they will spread beyond this area. Indeed, it is entirely possible that they lack the numbers to do so.” 

Federation President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] adopted a similar stance, while making an allusion to Federal-Imperial solidarity: 

“They haven’t set foot outside the Pleiades, and if they do, we have the means to deal with them. With [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] and [[id:77cf2f14-105e-4041-af04-1213f3e7383c][the Empire]] working together, there is no enemy we cannot overcome. The galactic community has nothing to fear.” 

But the buoyancy of these statements was undercut by Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis’s chief military liaison, who offered the following assessment to The Federal Times: 

“We have no intelligence regarding the Thargoids’ long-term plans, and it would be premature – if not irresponsible – to assert that they will remain in the Pleiades. I can assure you, however, that this is a matter Aegis is actively investigating.”
