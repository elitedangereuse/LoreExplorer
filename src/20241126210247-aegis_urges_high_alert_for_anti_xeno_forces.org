* Aegis Urges High Alert for Anti-Xeno Forces

/25 Nov 3310/

Professor [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Alba Tesreau]], Head of [[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]], has issued a warning for all
[[id:56ad8af3-baa1-4d0a-acd8-750400d280f4][anti-xeno]] fleets to remain on high alert.

The warning comes as human forces continue to push towards the last
remaining [[id:ba5ecc8d-cf87-4cf8-9d33-beb5d214e323][Thargoid Titan]], [[id:fbe81b20-15a4-466e-85a6-50816c6e2a99][Cocijo]]. While victory over the Thargoid
invasion force seems likely at this stage, [[id:c2623368-19b0-4995-9e35-b8f54f741a53][Tesreau]] has urged defensive
fleets not to become complacent.

“We have seen repeatedly that the Thargoid fleets are capable of
surprising us when their defeat seems inevitable. [[id:38143d4a-d8a5-4978-a62c-8b64a0c75969][The Proteus Wave]]
incident in [[id:55088d83-4221-44fa-a9d5-6ebb0866c722][HIP 22460]] is a perfect example of this – our confidence
was such that [[id:106b62b9-4ed8-4f7c-8c5c-12debf994d4f][Salvation]]’s celebratory speech was broadcast across the
core systems only moments before he was killed by a Thargoid
counterattack, along with thousands of military personnel.”

“[[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo Jin-ae]] has - rather publicly - insisted that her recent medical
emergency was the result of the Thargoids seeking to learn about her
and, by extension, humanity as a whole. Should this prove true, we
must assume that the Thargoids have new information to identify human
targets, orchestrate attacks and more. In recent days, [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo]] stated that
the Thargoid hive mind has altered its ‘tone’ in a way which has
previously led to a change in Thargoid tactics.”

“With this in mind, I implore AX defensive forces protecting our ports
and worlds from Thargoid assault to stay vigilant. [[id:c6b67ab9-66c5-4636-a978-2ca3a9ab012c][Shinrarta Dezhra]]’s
recent invasion proved the Thargoid fleet can still push behind the
war’s front line.”

[[id:85d9e888-3f5b-40ed-b8af-2eb87e42b0d0][Aegis]] has received criticism over its perceived failure to protect [[id:6bcd90ab-54f2-4d9a-9eeb-92815cc7766e][Seo
Jin-ae]] from Thargoid interception. Most notably, Imperial Fleet
Admiral [[id:75daea85-5e9f-4f6f-a102-1a5edea0283c][Denton Patreus]] commented that Seo should be ‘closely watched’
following her medical incident.
