* Increased Smuggling Activity in [[id:d40886f3-bc59-4f0d-8926-b125ee01c9bb][Epsilon Indi]]

/11 Nov 3301/

Authorities in the [[id:d40886f3-bc59-4f0d-8926-b125ee01c9bb][Epsilon Indi]] system have reported a dramatic increase in smuggling over the past week. Station personnel at London Relay – believed to be the focus of the smuggling activity – declined to provide specifics, but an anonymous source at the starport said: 

"Apparently a group called 'Revolution Incorporated' put out a request for explosives, which is why there's been a spike. Of course, the station authorities don't want people to know the station is full of explosives, especially with the summit conference starting soon, but I gather the response to the request was pretty enthusiastic." 

The Federal Times approached Revolution Incorporated for a response to this statement, but received only a brief, cryptic reply: 

"People have started to forget about old Guy and his friends. We think it's time someone reminded them."
