* [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] Retaliates Against Pharma Giant

/09 Sep 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Kumo Council has declared war on the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group for the latter’s role in supporting Neomedical Industries. 

The pharmaceutical corporation’s recent campaign in the Haithis system enabled the mass production of onionhead gamma strain, scheduled to be available as a medicinal product from Alliance and independent markets. The drug is currently distributed in a handful of anarchy systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate. 

As hostilities erupted in the Haithis system, [[id:7aae0550-b8ba-42cf-b52b-e7040461c96f][Archon Delaine]] broadcast a message for Neomedical Industries: 

“Did you truly believe you could steal from us and survive unscathed? Now your allies will pay for your greed with their blood.” 

In response, CEO Olwyn Kendrick broadcast a call for help: 

“This terrifying attack by the galaxy’s most vicious pirates may pressure investors to withdraw, causing the entire project to collapse. If so, the vital materials that pilots delivered will be wasted. To prevent this, we urgently require support for our corporate partners against these criminals.” 

The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group is offering rewards to pilots who help protect its ships against pirate assault. The Kumo Council has also offered to reimburse mercenaries who fight on their behalf.
