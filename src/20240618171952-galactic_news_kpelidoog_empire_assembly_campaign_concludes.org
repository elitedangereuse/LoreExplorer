* Galactic News: Kpelidoog Empire Assembly Campaign Concludes

/25 Aug 3303/

A spokesperson for the Kpelidoog Empire Assembly has announced that its plan to build a new Wells-class Carrier has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver construction materials to Hipparchus Terminal, the organisation’s base of operations. 

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Kpelidoog Empire Assembly released a statement: 

“We are immeasurably grateful to all those who supported this initiative. Having met our targets, we hope to start work on the new ship soon.” 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Hipparchus Terminal in the Kpelidoog system.
