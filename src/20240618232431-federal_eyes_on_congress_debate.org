* Federal Eyes on Congress Debate

/14 Mar 3309/

Preliminary motions on the forthcoming Hudson Contravention vote have begun in Federal Congress. 

The proposal, named after President Zachary Hudson’s call to suspend the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord, is a point of significant contention. If approved, Hudson would be eligible to run for another term in this year’s presidential elections, breaking with centuries of constitutional law.  

Supporters of the proposal, led by Hudson’s cabinet, point to the ongoing conflict with the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] as a primary reason to vote in favour. With the significant escalation in [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] aggression and the loss of hundreds of systems, it has been argued that a change of leadership could weaken the Federation’s ability to defend itself. 

Opponents have called the move a ‘dictatorial’ tactic which uses the fear of alien attack to influence public opinion. Felicia Winters, the Liberal candidate and current shadow president, recently discussed this further during an interview with the Federal Free Press: 

“In these difficult times we cannot forget who we are, or what makes [[id:d56d0a6d-142a-4110-9c9a-235df02a99e0][the Federation]] great. The 77th amendment was established in 2594, and has defined the presidential length of service ever since. This structure not only provides clarity to the people who use their vote to inform Federal governance, but also to each individual entrusted with the honour of the presidency. To change it now would send a message that we have lost faith in the Federation’s political mechanism.” 

The official vote on the Hudson Contravention motion is expected to take place next week.
