* Community Goal: Bringing Peace to Ngolibardu

/26 May 3302/

Authorities in the Ngolibardu system have reported that the number of criminals operating in the area has risen sharply over the past few months. Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord. 

To counter this threat, Ngolibardu Electronics [[id:6ace5ab9-af2a-4ad7-bb52-6059c0d3ab4a][Sol]]utions has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Ngolibardu system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Vernadsky Port. 

The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
