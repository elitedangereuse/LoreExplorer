[[id:b555bc13-0686-4eb7-b73f-a1116908fad9][Elli]]

On November 10th 3302 [[id:a443f49b-b347-4aec-8e3d-96932a23046d][Wright City]] in the Elli system fell prey to a
[[id:32267587-a5db-456f-8a09-439ed0309638][chemical-weapon]] [[id:04673d31-5035-4581-b189-60da2755007c][attack]].

The attack was believed to have been executed by the anarchist
organisation [[id:8ec6df28-592d-4db6-bc07-84ab2a3882ec][Revolution Incorporated]], which recently placed orders for
a quantity of [[id:1c68e942-6f27-44f7-a8a5-b458c544a9fd][Toxandji Virocide]], a rare pesticide. It was understood
the group used the pesticide as the basis for a potent [[id:f5d069de-b68e-4d02-853e-6a6b7b32d93a][chemical]]
weapon.

The impact on the starport has been catastrophic. Over a dozen
individuals have lost their lives, and hundreds more are in critical
condition. As a result, the starport was closed until further notice.
