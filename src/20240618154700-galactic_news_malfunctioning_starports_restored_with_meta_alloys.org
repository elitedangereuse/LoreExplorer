* Galactic News: Malfunctioning Starports Restored with Meta-Alloys

/20 May 3302/

Recent reports indicate that a number of starports forced to suspend services due to Unknown Artefact-related interference have been restored to normality through the application of meta-alloys. Ackerman Market in Eravate, Gabriel Enterprise in Harma, Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis and Onnes [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]] in LFT 37 are all now reported to be fully operational. 

This development – a testament to the hard work of the pilots who have delivered meta-alloys to the affected stations – will no doubt bring hope to those still affected by the technological plague. 

The starports currently closed as a result of Unknown Artefact-related interference are: 

Lave Station, [[id:ff595332-6a13-4f69-ae2f-cc0a0df8e741][Lave]] 

Ising Dock, 109 Piscium 

Fozard Dock, HIP 19934 

Irens Dock, Manite 

von Bellingshausen Port, Almar 

Haack [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]], Halbangaay 

Gurragchaa [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]], Warkushanui 

Korolyov Hub, Arawere 

Lobachevsky Outpost, Pic Tok 

Carter Port, [[id:6da9023a-ccb6-444a-be77-626dfb552eb1][Rhea]] 

Meanwhile, the following starports continue to experience technical issues: 

Alexander Freeport, HIP 18843 

Bloch Vision, Loperada 

Love Ring, Evejitaka 

Robigo Mines, Robigo 

Saunders's Dive, Wolf 1301 

Skvortsov Orbital, 63 G. Capricorni 

Kooi [[id:e179ecca-9ab3-4184-b05e-107b2e6932c2][Gateway]], HIP 93377 

[[id:f37f17f1-8eb3-4598-93f7-190fe97438a1][Jaques]] Station, Gliese 1269
