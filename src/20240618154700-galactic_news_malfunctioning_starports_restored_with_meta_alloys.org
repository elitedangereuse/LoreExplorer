* Galactic News: Malfunctioning Starports Restored with Meta-Alloys

/20 May 3302/

Recent reports indicate that a number of starports forced to suspend services due to Unknown Artefact-related interference have been restored to normality through the application of meta-alloys. Ackerman Market in Eravate, Gabriel Enterprise in Harma, Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis and Onnes Gateway in LFT 37 are all now reported to be fully operational. 

This development – a testament to the hard work of the pilots who have delivered meta-alloys to the affected stations – will no doubt bring hope to those still affected by the technological plague. 

The starports currently closed as a result of Unknown Artefact-related interference are: 

Lave Station, Lave 

Ising Dock, 109 Piscium 

Fozard Dock, HIP 19934 

Irens Dock, Manite 

von Bellingshausen Port, Almar 

Haack Gateway, Halbangaay 

Gurragchaa Gateway, Warkushanui 

Korolyov Hub, Arawere 

Lobachevsky Outpost, Pic Tok 

Carter Port, Rhea 

Meanwhile, the following starports continue to experience technical issues: 

Alexander Freeport, HIP 18843 

Bloch Vision, Loperada 

Love Ring, Evejitaka 

Robigo Mines, Robigo 

Saunders's Dive, Wolf 1301 

Skvortsov Orbital, 63 G. Capricorni 

Kooi Gateway, HIP 93377 

Jaques Station, Gliese 1269
