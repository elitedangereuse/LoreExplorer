Fuel Rats Complete 2,000th Rescue 
 
In the 38 days since the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]]' last made headlines, the group has
rescued a further 1,000 ships, bringing the total number of Commanders
saved from a frustrating insurance experience to 2,000.

Financial experts have speculated that this service could have saved
the Galactic economy as much as 1 billion credits in insurance buyback
premiums, not counting the value of lost cargo, exploration data, and
bounty vouchers.

In a statement, the [[id:de6c1eee-a957-4d48-a840-f3fe15b5801b][Fuel Rats]] extended special congratulations to
Commander [[id:48d8b14a-3eb9-4d19-8127-c4b0a9935edb][KitsuneThe Fluff]] and Commander [[id:114af261-aac3-4741-9534-2ed7f1cf62ea][Radlock]] for each achieving
100 individual rescues, with Commander KitsuneThe Fluff being the
first to achieve this distinction. Commander Radlok was also singled
out for praise after completing 100 rescues in just 45 days.

On behalf of the galaxy at large, we thank you for your service,
Commanders. The dedication you have shown in saving your fellow
spacefarers from misfortune is to be applauded.

Commander [[id:3fa4a5b4-c9e2-4d08-ba8e-8e2e8f21c0a3][Ceska Zbrojovka]]
