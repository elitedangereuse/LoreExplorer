* Thief Strikes Again

/14 Feb 3305/

A number of invaluable art treasures have been stolen from the Museum of Civilisation on Mars. 

Museum historian Dr Imogen Ryang said: 

“The stolen pieces include Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Two Circles (17th Century), Guernica by Picasso (20th Century) and Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke (23rd Century). Each of the works was replaced with the image of a winking cat.” 

“The loss of so many cultural artefacts is incalculable. This despicable criminal should have been hunted down long ago.” 

Culture journalist Kioko McGrath published an alternative view in [[id:be5df73c-519d-45ed-a541-9b70bc8ae97c][The Federal Times]]: 

“High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the ‘winking cat’ motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art.”
