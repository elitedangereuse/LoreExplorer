On June 3rd 3302 humanity's newest and most advanced Unknown Artefact research centre, the Canonn institute in Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43, finally opened. / Dr. Arcanonn, under heavy guard, was the first to arrive at the opening ceremony, and he had this to say: / "It is an amazing feeling to stand before you after being in hiding for so long. After more than a year of work, the Canonn had become one of the most open, diligent and dedicated science organizations in inhabited space, and now we have an amazing research centre."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
