[[id:a8cb34c1-e8ae-4e64-95e4-dca24911b9c0][Col 285 Sector IX-T D3-43]]

On June 3rd 3302 humanity's newest and most advanced Unknown Artefact
research centre, the [[id:a45b734c-f77d-4300-8e15-16fb5d0941c8][Canonn Institute]] in Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43,
finally opened.

Dr. [[id:941ab45b-f406-4b3a-a99b-557941634355][Arcanonn]], under heavy guard, was the first to arrive at the
opening ceremony, and he had this to say:

"It is an amazing feeling to stand before you after being in hiding
for so long. After more than a year of work, the Canonn had become one
of the most open, diligent and dedicated science organizations in
inhabited space, and now we have an amazing research centre."
