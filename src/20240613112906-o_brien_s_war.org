* 0195 O'Brien's War
[[id:51a92498-ef1b-4fc3-9ad7-9e49fb947353][Cemiess]]

In 3098 Governor [[id:9492a08d-0edc-46db-969f-dc8670665346][Santorini]] of Tau Ceti, was [[id:fed0655d-b1b6-4136-adf7-9e688793af93][assassinated]]. The Federal
press pinned the blame on the Empire, citing several quotes form
'Proxmire' Santorini's speeches that would make him an Imperial
target. Unusually, the Emperor chose to make a personal rebuttal of
the accusation. Nevertheless, three years later Imperial colonists
escorted by Imperial warships, settled on Emerald in the Cemiess
system. The Federation responded by sending [[id:023eef0b-13ab-4af0-8c43-bd0b6bcbd6b8][Admiral O'Brien]] with a
task force, who also dropped a military force onto the planet. Over
the next thirty years, both sides backed local forces (with occasional
direct naval confrontation) to gain control of the planet and the
system, though ultimaterly Imperial defenders prevailed with the
Empire basing the VI Fleet in the system. O'Brien's efforts were
popularised in the fictional holo-vid series "O'Brien's War".
