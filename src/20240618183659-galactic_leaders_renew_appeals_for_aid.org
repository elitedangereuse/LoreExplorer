* Galactic Leaders Renew Appeals for Aid

/09 Feb 3304/

Seventeen starports have now been attacked by the Thargoids, resulting in widespread destruction and loss of life. Many of these stations remain in a critical state, and are unable to offer essential services. 

In response, Federal President [[id:02322be1-fc02-4d8b-acf6-9a9681e3fb15][Zachary Hudson]] and Emperor [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] have issued fresh appeals for aid, imploring independent pilots to support relief efforts. 

In her announcement, [[id:34f3cfdd-0536-40a9-8732-13bf3a5e4a70][Arissa Lavigny-Duval]] said: 

“Relief coordinators are doing everything they can, but without the support of the galactic community, the restoration of these stations will take a long time. I therefore implore independent pilots to deliver essential commodities to the affected starports, and to evacuate civilians.” 

The Emperor also confirmed that Aegis is investigating reports that the [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoids]] are moving towards the core systems.
