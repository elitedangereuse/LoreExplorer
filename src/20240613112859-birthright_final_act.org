* 0183 Birthright Final Act
[[id:f0fea079-ca2f-420e-8dce-e69ca46ae126][Anlave]]

The commercial race in starship innovation together with increased
funding from the [[id:fcf3d94e-5acb-473a-a89a-fed30e6e9d05][Birthright Wars]] allowed the Federation to renew and
centralise its military power. In the past, mobilising a fleet had
required mustering resources from each member system, but generous
corporate charters authorised different corporations to build an
maintain centralised fleets. The first of this was commissioned and
trained at [[id:f0fea079-ca2f-420e-8dce-e69ca46ae126][Anlave]] in 2702, providing a much needed new purpose for the
ruined agricultural system. These could be deployed much more
efficiently against the Federation's enemies.

Anlave was the site for the final act in the Birthright Wars. Exiled
descendants of displaced original colonists, invaded the system in
2708, and bombarded the Naval Academy at [[id:57143d9c-965c-4fb0-bd42-2b45e4589ae8][Anderton]], obliterating it. A
battlefleet of privateers descended on the system, but were beaten
back by a spirited and shrewd tactician; Admiral [[id:dd72cef0-b1f5-4d3e-ba1a-6df0f944138d][Ghenkis B'nami]]. It
was believed at the time that Imperial finance had sponsored the coup,
but no link was ever proven, and this is now seen as scaremongering.
