* The Hunt for Justice

/20 Apr 3301/

Senator Patreus has today begun the process of sending his agents to reclaim the debt owed to him by the government of Kui Hsien. 

The Friends of Kui Hsien, the cooperative council that rules over the region, had previously entered into an agreement with Senator Patreus to supply Kui Hsien with the arms they needed to repel an invasion by the Federal-aligned Future of LTT 911 Party.  Kui Hsien’s economy was devastated during the war with LTT 911, and the Friends now find themselves in the unenviable position of being unable to repay their debt. 

Over the last week, dozens of local traders have gone to extraordinary efforts to stimulate Kui Hsien’s economy. Sadly their efforts were not enough, as the Friends of Kui Hsien still find themselves unable to meet the financial demands placed on them by Senator Patreus and [[id:9fa174ce-7273-40ba-a0e6-1225bcda40b6][Eotienses]] Silver Universal PLC. 

As a result, Senator Patreus has authorised the Conservatives of BV Phoenicis to begin the forfeiture process. Imperial mercenaries interested in participating in the reclamation effort are being invited to sign up for active duty aboard Aoki Dock in BV Phoenicis.
