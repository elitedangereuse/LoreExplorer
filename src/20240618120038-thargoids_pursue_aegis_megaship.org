* Thargoids Pursue Aegis Megaship

/21 May 3307/

*Pilots Federation ALERT* 

The Alexandria megaship has jumped from Delphi to the HIP 16538 system, triggering a Thargoid attack. 

The megaship is carrying large quantities of Guardian artefacts, which were delivered as part of a research programme by Aegis.  

Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, has broadcast an SOS: 

“This is an emergency! We scheduled a stopover in HIP 16538 for tritium refuelling en route to the Sol system, but Thargoid interceptors came swarming in within minutes. We require immediate assistance!” 

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, announced: 

“We believe that the Thargoids are reacting to the concentrated presence of Guardian technology stored within the Alexandria’s cargo holds. Not only has the attack placed its crew and the population of this system in danger, but we risk losing these extremely valuable research materials.” 

“Aegis is asking anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots to help destroy all Thargoid vessels within HIP 16538 and protect the Alexandria.”
