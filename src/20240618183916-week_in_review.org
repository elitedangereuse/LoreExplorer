* Week in Review

/20 Oct 3304/

Here are this week’s major stories. 

Gibson Kincaid has been announced as the winner of [[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]] presidential election, and will continue serving as president of the Alliance. Kincaid obtained a small majority of the public vote, defeating Councillor Elijah Beck. Prime Minister [[id:da80c263-3c2d-43dd-ab3f-1fbf40490f74][Edmund Mahon]] said the Alliance Assembly was still debating Kincaid’s proposal to imbue the presidential role with executive powers. 

An attempt by armed intruders to access Phoenix Base in the Meene system, home of the engineer Ram Tah, has been foiled. [[id:4551539e-a6b2-4c45-8923-40fb603202b7][Ram Tah]] said he believed the thwarted raid was an attempt to steal research data or samples of Guardian technology. 

In other news, the Federal Security Service has targeted The Mars Tribune as part of its investigation into robots carrying concealed surveillance programs. The development follows news that several of those found to be in possession of ‘spy’ robots were the subject of incriminating articles published by the Tribune. The conglomerate that owns The Mars Tribune has challenged any suggestion of wrongdoing. 

Billionaire businessman Zachary Rackham has been targeted by a highly sophisticated hack that withdrew 1 billion credits from his personal account. Rackham Capital Investments confirmed that the criminals left a message encoded in Rackham’s account: ‘The Collective plays to win.’ It has been speculated that the hack was intended to reclaim the billion-credit prize that Rackham won in the Federal Grand Lottery. 

Meanwhile, the Palin Institute has announced a new research programme designed to discern the motives behind the Thargoids’ unrelenting aggression.  The Institute has asked the galactic community to contribute [[id:09343513-2893-458e-a689-5865fdc32e0a][Thargoid]] research material to the campaign. 

Finally, the Close Encounters Corps has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community. The materials delivered to Crown Prospect over the past week will allow the construction of a scientific megaship to research the nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. 

And those are the main stories this week.
