* Galactic News: Denton Patreus Receives Promotion

/22 Feb 3302/

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has announced that Senator Denton Patreus is to be promoted to Admiral of the Fleet, following his triumph over the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn. In a statement, the Emperor praised Patreus's recent military success: 

"Denton Patreus exhibited remarkable resolve in the campaign against Emperor's Dawn, and demonstrated his ability to act with conviction in the face of an often unpredictable enemy. I can think of no more appropriate person to assume command of the Imperial Navy. It is with great pride that I confer upon him the title of Admiral of the Fleet." 

The senator is expected to assume his new role next week following a formal inauguration ceremony on Capitol.
