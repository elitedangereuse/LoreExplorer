Brookes Memorial Series – Beacon 1/5

Every journey starts somewhere. For Michael Brookes, it began with a
passion for telling stories and sharing experiences. A Keen enthusiast
of games, literature, and associated collections, he drew inspiration
from authors and worldbuilders both contemporary and
historic. Michael’s own works reflected this, and he wrote with
passion about fantasy, science fiction and mythological beings.

But when Michael looked to the stars, it was clear his journey was
destined to weave among them.
