* Deep Space ‘Anomalies’ Generate Discussion

/23 Sep 3308/

*Pilots’ Federation ALERT* 

Inexplicable visual phenomena located in deep space have caused extensive speculation and media interest. 

There is no official terminology for the signals but they are referred to by many names, most popular of which is ‘the anomalies’. Appearing as a bright flare with spiralling radial arms, they emit electromagnetic feedback that can be detected using full spectrum system (FSS) scanners. 

The first anomaly was discovered beyond the permit-locked Col 70 sector, with additional signals now observed. Multiple calculations have verified that the objects are moving, supposedly at faster-than-light speeds. Various estimates as to their trajectory have been made, but the great distances involved defy accurate measurement. 

The appearance of the anomalies so soon after the Battle of HIP 22460 has led many to assume that they are somehow related to the Thargoids. These fears have been exacerbated by the claims of the [[id:04ae001b-eb07-4812-a42e-4bb72825609b][Far God]] cult that this is a sign of their deity’s imminent arrival, but early analysis has yielded no evidence that the anomaly is Thargoid in origin. 

The engineer [[id:d8266505-5aa0-40a3-aa84-4b6519a16b24][Kit Fowler]] collated several ideas during his End Times broadcast: 

“The anomaly could be some form of hyperspace distortion generated by an exceptionally large object heading our way. Or maybe the Thargoids have built a dimensional portal, through which their fleets can attack anywhere. Perhaps they’ve fired a colossal system-destroying weapon at Sol, as an act of revenge against humanity for the Proteus Wave. We’ve got to prepare for the very worst, people!” 

However, Professor Elizabeth Perez of Orion University quickly dismissed these theories:  

“Such outlandish notions illustrate how people draw imaginary patterns between unconnected events. Scientific progress has not stopped us inventing human-centric explanations for natural phenomena, especially when experiencing feelings of guilt or paranoia.”
