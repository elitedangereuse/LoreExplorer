* Anti-NMLA Intelligence Unit Formed

/17 Mar 3307/

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have created a centralised agency
dedicated to investigating and eliminating the [[id:dbfbb5eb-82a2-43c8-afb9-252b21b8464f][NMLA]] paramilitary
group.

The new Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) is a direct result of
the [[id:819b59a6-0569-490d-9d51-b1deb9ef72d8][Cornelius-Lasky Convention]], which was signed at the [[id:c19cec97-cb93-4049-be5d-1abcaa6023a5][Galactic
Summit]].

This treaty requires the superpowers to share information on any
large-scale threats to civilian populations. With a combined death
toll rising over half a million, the recent starport bombings have
obtained such status.

ACT will be jointly led by the veterans of the tri-superpower
taskforce that defeated the League of Reparation in 3304: Captain
[[id:cdaa5220-8f79-47dc-b160-a5d3d1ca30a0][Niamh Seutonia]] of the Imperial Internal Security Service, Inspector
[[id:2569323a-d569-4399-8cda-ae371000dc8b][Mara Klatt]] of Alliance Interpol, and Senior Agent [[id:fb74a286-1688-41e8-9bec-9ef14adaaf1f][Tanya Ramirez]] of the
Federal Intelligence Agency.

Captain Seutonia gave a brief statement:

“ACT is an independent organisation dedicated to bringing the NMLA to
justice. We will draw resources from Alliance, Empire and Federation
security forces and elsewhere.”

“However, we foresee the need for even larger numbers of dedicated
personnel. Therefore, we have contacted the Pilots Federation for
permission to invite independent pilots to gather information for us
when necessary.”

Pilots are advised that civilians still require transportation from
damaged starports in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway,
Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems.
