* ER11. Distant Worlds II Inaugural Jump
[[id:4ccdf1db-68db-4935-8cac-b6d23e01d78d][Pallaeni]]

Distant Worlds II was an ambitious five-month expedition to the far
outer rim. It launched from the [[id:4ccdf1db-68db-4935-8cac-b6d23e01d78d][Pallaeni]] system in January of 3305 and
reached its final destination of [[id:80ea667a-62b4-4082-bed0-ce253d76869b][Beagle Point]] in May 3305. The purpose
of the expedition was to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, and to
construct a starport at [[id:84d9b01d-a9d6-47d9-b9f9-f6154233e585][Sagittarius A*]]. This beacon marks the point
where participating pilots made their first hyperspace jump after
leaving [[id:4ccdf1db-68db-4935-8cac-b6d23e01d78d][Pallaeni]].
