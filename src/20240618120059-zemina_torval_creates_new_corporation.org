* [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] Creates New Corporation

/10 Aug 3307/

A new independent branch of Mastopolos Mining has been established by its controlling shareholder, Senator [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]]. 

The megacorp is owned by the powerful Mastopolos family, and operates throughout the Empire and beyond. However, Torval’s position as a majority shareholder has allowed her to exert a strong influence on its activities. 

Senator Torval confirmed her plans in a statement to The Imperial Herald: 

“Diversification is an effective strategy in the current business climate. Torval-Mastopolos Mining will have corporate autonomy, while offering the same mining and transportation services to an emergent client base.” 

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reported: 

“The persistent rumours of a rift between [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] and her cousin, CEO [[id:7344d4cd-7b21-4aa2-895b-98a4acefe96f][Gabriella Mastopolos]], may now be validated. Insiders report that after decades of working behind the scenes, Torval wishes to provide a more tangible legacy for her own children. Already she has set her sights on a permit-controlled system as the headquarters for this new company.” 

As well as being renowned for her private wealth and corporate enterprises, [[id:d8e3667c-3ba1-43aa-bc90-dac719c6d5e7][Zemina Torval]] has been a prominent member of the Imperial Senate for decades. She has occasionally deputised as chancellor, and is known to be an outspoken champion of the Empire’s traditions.
