* 0127 Olgrea History
[[id:c46f5348-be85-4d06-bf04-12a9b812d0ad][Mic Turner]], the Intergalactic Explorer, ship designer and founder of
[[id:1d726aa0-3e07-43b4-9b72-074046d25c3c][the Alliance]], led the Federation expeditionary team that brought
colonists to Olgrea in 3224.

Terraforming operations began almost immediately as the Federation
could see that further population growth in the region would require
room to accommodate.

In 3239, Alliance warships and Turner's command returned to the system
and after a short altercation with Federal forces won control of
[[id:5881deec-aaa1-4f97-97d7-c3968ddda115][Fortress Jung]] and [[id:55397ce4-12ff-4e79-ac5f-f46dae2f8255][New Casablanca]]. After this it was only a matter of
time before the rest of the system surrendered and the Federation
withdrew.

By 3250, the Olgrea system had become a massive part of the Alliance
infrastructure. The planet, [[id:7eed25a3-8aaa-4a60-9e16-09d24e7d631d][New Gotham]] became the centre of
[[id:9c05054a-485b-40d4-a855-af6364cca82a][agricultural]] production for the entire Alliance sector. The system
population had grown to approach 100 million inhabitants, one of the
fastest system migrations in interstellar history.
