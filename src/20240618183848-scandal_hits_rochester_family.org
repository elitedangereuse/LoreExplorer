* Scandal Hits [[id:3b0c33aa-114d-4dcc-9e04-b5a233157fa1][Rochester Family]]

/06 Sep 3304/

The famous actor [[id:f3e29df5-154d-4f05-b659-36fa2da9be01][Tomas Turai]], husband of [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]], has been revealed to be having an extramarital affair with an Olympian athlete. 

An article in The Mars Tribune stated: 

“For the last three years, [[id:f3e29df5-154d-4f05-b659-36fa2da9be01][Tomas Turai]] has conducted a secret relationship with [[id:7d223812-2269-45ec-93b7-bf57dd42394b][Reagan Lord]], who has won several Olympic gold medals for the Altair system. Their romantic liaison took place without the knowledge of Turai’s husband, [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]], or their two children.” 

There has been no response from [[id:c33064d1-c2a0-4ac3-89fe-57eedb7ef9c8][Jupiter Rochester]]. The Rochester family is currently in a media lockdown following the cancelled wedding of Ambassador [[id:81c5c161-1553-44f0-b5fb-c4a58f1f71d7][Jordan Rochester]] and Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]]. 

But [[id:f3e29df5-154d-4f05-b659-36fa2da9be01][Tomas Turai]] and August Lord, husband of [[id:7d223812-2269-45ec-93b7-bf57dd42394b][Reagan Lord]], have both announced their intention to sue The Mars Tribune for defamation. The publication’s owner, billionaire [[id:74cae77e-fab1-4a22-9c31-daaa15d8fd0e][Kingsley Cordova]], has confirmed that he will personally cover all legal costs in contesting both civil actions. 

[[id:6d78c541-458f-413f-83fd-e86ab6415c8e][Lana Sigrid]], chief editor of The Mars Tribune, published this comment: 

“We have an obligation to publish the [[id:7401153d-d710-4385-8cac-aad74d40d853][truth]] wherever we find it. The detailed evidence we’ve obtained about [[id:f3e29df5-154d-4f05-b659-36fa2da9be01][Tomas Turai]]’s behaviour is beyond dispute. We employ the finest journalists in the Federation, and our soaring subscription figures prove we’ve earned the public’s trust.”
