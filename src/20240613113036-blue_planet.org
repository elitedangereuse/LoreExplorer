Starship Enterprises and Blue Creative eventually buried the hatchet and started working together once again. A Blue Creative owned satellite nicknamed blue planet quickly became an important outpost for a number of reasons. A military outpost called Thirsk Survey became an important stop off point for SE security forces in their ongoing war against crime in the outer system. SE gunslinger pilots plied their trade in the local resource extraction sites, protecting entrepreneuring miners. Scott Beacon and its famous race track became the home of the SRV Race Club, entertaining locals with their wild and wacky races.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
