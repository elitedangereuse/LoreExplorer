[[id:d20f91af-3196-4258-ad57-64c7c61e5ed9][Starship Enterprises]] and [[id:c44f2965-3d8c-45e5-8f66-90e1b57aa83d][Blue Creative]] eventually buried the hatchet
and started working together once again. A Blue Creative owned
satellite nicknamed blue planet quickly became an important outpost
for a number of reasons. A military outpost called [[id:13dba681-df46-4cbd-9663-4b78638e4b9a][Thirsk Survey]]
became an important stop off point for SE security forces in their
ongoing war against crime in the outer system. SE gunslinger pilots
plied their trade in the local resource extraction sites, protecting
entrepreneuring miners. [[id:e9f9f25f-8af4-486c-b6dc-1544fa74cbab][Scott Beacon]] and its famous race track became
the home of the SRV Race Club, entertaining locals with their wild and
wacky races.
