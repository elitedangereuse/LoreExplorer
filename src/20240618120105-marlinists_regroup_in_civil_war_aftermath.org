* Marlinists Regroup in Civil War Aftermath

/27 Aug 3307/

The Marlinist Colonies are recovering from a period of political infighting and inter-faction conflict. 

Octavia Volkov has been voted in as the new first minister following a snap election. Her decisive action against Aaron Whyte’s Neo-Marlinist movement, which led to the elimination of the NMLA’s political wing, drew huge support from voters. 

In a parliamentary address, First Minister Volkov said: 

“We must focus on building an independent society rather than changing the Empire. In time we will evolve into the fully-fledged Marlinist Republic we have fought so hard for, and perhaps inspire our Imperial cousins to walk the path to democracy.” 

Marlinist factions now control all eight of their original colony systems, some of which had temporarily fallen under external governance. They have also expanded into a handful of new systems. 

Prime Consul Kayode Tau, the chief ambassador of the Marlinists, has established formal channels with the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations and the Federal Diplomatic Corps. The Empire recognises the Marlinist Consulate, but maintains a distant relationship with what many consider to be subversive ex-Imperials. 

The ceremonial funeral of First Minister Jenna Fairfax has taken place. Speakers drew attention to her achievements and leadership qualities. In a gesture that many viewed as an olive branch from the Empire, Princess [[id:b402bbe3-5119-4d94-87ee-0ba279658383][Aisling Duval]] attended virtually and spoke of her meeting with Fairfax during the Galactic Summit.
