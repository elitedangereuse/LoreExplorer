* Mandalay Released: Zorgon Peterson’s SCO-Friendly Explorer Ships Out

/31 Oct 3310/

The first run of [[id:55bc934d-fae8-4cf7-afbc-825ef95e82af][Mandalay]] ships has been delivered to shipyards across
the core systems and are now available for purchase.

[[id:d24ee8f5-e2ec-4c71-b5fa-afc2d9710141][Zorgon Peterson]]’s Mandalay is the third new vessel to be optimised for
[[id:6ebf2d4f-85a9-4251-82c9-406c9c06b5a1][Achilles Aerospace]]’s [[id:bb129165-335b-4dc9-9cf0-ee6640728a92][SCO]] frame shift drive – following the [[id:462821c7-39f9-43bb-8d70-2dedb90f52f3][Python
Mk. II]] and the [[id:cbcc7192-cc42-4692-875e-71381c29eb33][Type-8]] - and aims to become the premier medium-sized
exploration craft.

Chief Marketing Officer [[id:78aac322-5926-44aa-9678-c792c3f2ca68][Devin Kaneda]] sent a press statement to all
shipyard outlets:

“The [[id:55bc934d-fae8-4cf7-afbc-825ef95e82af][Mandalay]] allows pilots to achieve a considerable jump range while
maintaining the manoeuverability of its size class, expanding the
range of future exploration voyages of its size class. Our technicians
have ensured that the ship’s handling in atmospheric conditions is
exceptional, easing the travel down to undiscovered worlds.”

“A rethink of structural stress resistance, in cooperation with
Achilles engineers, has resulted in the Mandalay taking full advantage
of the SCO frame shift drive. We believe this vessel is an exceptional
package for pilots who wish to explore the galaxy efficiently,
comfortably and in style.”

Notable at the Mandalay’s release party was the lack of a
representative of Sirius Corporation. Rumours of an ongoing
disagreement between representatives and Zorgon Peterson management
over Achilles’ design input have grown in volume in recent weeks.
