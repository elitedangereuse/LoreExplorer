* 0707 When Buckyballing Goes Badly Wrong
[[id:73c1ecaa-9daa-48e9-8228-12157896fb29][241 G. Aquarii]]

This beacon marks the location where one of the most heroic moments in
[[id:4a1281c7-6b40-4e3f-bfdf-0ea14c6695b3][Buckyball]] Racing began. At 2:35 am on the 7th of May 3303, Commander
Tannik Seldon had an unfortunate mistake that would lead the pilot
going down in legend.

Tannik Seldon had signed up for a race known to many as the
Buckyball. These races held all over the galaxy are known for
punishing routes and questionable sanity of the racers. This
particular event known as "the Aquarium Job" tasked pilots with racing
between three locations using an unmodified Adder, and an SRV to
complete the course. It was here at cooper Arena, looking for an edge
on his competitors that the commander made what he initially thought
was a superb tactical move. Remembering that ships completing the race
with 1% hull received a time bonus, Seldon proceeded to lower his
vessels hull to the required amount. However this would prove his
undoing. Having completed his scan at the nearby settlement Seldon
called his ship in for a landing and watched in stunned silence as his
ship exploded as it touched down. No amount of duct tape was going to
solve this problem.

Many pilots would have given up at that point, called for assistance
of looked for the self destruct button. But not Tannik Seldon.

Technically he was still in the race. With a quick check of the race
rules and remembering that there was a port on the other side of the
planet. What followed goes down as the greatest moment to date in
Buckyballing history. It was game on.

With just one week before the end of the race, Seldon accepted the
challenge and set off on a mammoth 3000 km journey, which he describes
as "Slightly inconvenient by the face that (station) was on the exact
opposite side of the planet".

Seldon showed supreme levels of determination, concentration and near
god like driving skills as he drove the colossal distance to what he
hoped was his way off the planet. His route crossing mountains,
canyons, and huge craters all while averaging speeds upward of 80 m/s
with the knowledge that one unfortunate bounce or spin could spell
disaster.

So it was until 2:50 PM on the 12th of May 3303 when Seldon announced
to the many people following his progress two words, "Mission
Accomplished". He had made it. Seldon did not want to bask in his
achievement instead immediately buying a new regulation Adder and
completing the race, making him the first Buckyballer to lose his ship
halfway through a race and still finish successfully.
