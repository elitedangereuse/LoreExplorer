* Commercial Travel Impacted by Hyperspace Fears

/24 Jan 3305/

The mysterious disappearance of actor Consuela Knight and the crew of her yacht has affected confidence in commercial space travel. 

Independent newsfeed The Sovereign reported: 

“Consuela Knight’s empty ship pulling into port has caused unease in consumer markets. Rumours of abductions and disintegrations while in hyperspace have negatively impacted many businesses.” 

“Ship manufacturer Saud Kruger has said that sales of customised luxury yachts, such as Ms Knight’s, have plummeted. Cruise bookings with Astrogator Tours are being cancelled, while commercial operators have reported a drop in passenger numbers.” 

“Plans are underway for a memorial service to honour Consuela Knight’s career. But her real legacy is the fear that her fate could befall any interstellar traveller.”
