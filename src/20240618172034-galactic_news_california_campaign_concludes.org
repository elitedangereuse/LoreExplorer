* Galactic News: California Campaign Concludes

/17 Nov 3303/

Civility Marks, the Chief Security Officer for the Spinward Marches Alliance Concern, has announced that the organisation’s campaign to establish an agricultural facility in the Synuefai LX-R d5-28 system has reached a successful conclusion, thanks to support from the space-faring community. Construction of the facility is expected to begin within the next few weeks. 

The Spinward Marches Alliance Concern has extended its gratitude to those who supported the initiative, and invited them to try Morrina or Badfort Tea when returning to Hansford’s Landing. 

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Hansford’s Landing in the BD+22 4939 system.
