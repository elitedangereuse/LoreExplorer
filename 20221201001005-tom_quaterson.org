#+title: Tom Quaterson
In 2617, the death of Tom Quaterson, a munitions worker
who had been convicted of selling food coupons to the poor, was the
spark that lit the flame of revolt. Workers on the gas platforms
seized control of the facilities and planetside, the general populace
stormed the Governor's residence.
